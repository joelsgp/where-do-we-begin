The next episode will have a different name, but it'll be the same content.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Join the discord if you wanna ask questions: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=oXc0N8vkC0k&event=video_description&redir_token=zS1lmqIIVGyqqf0Pnaa9Ds5Krl58MTU0NDU2NzkzNEAxNTQ0NDgxNTM0&q=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FcM3rndZ'>https://discord.gg/cM3rndZ</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Follow us:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Twitch: <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=oXc0N8vkC0k&event=video_description&redir_token=zS1lmqIIVGyqqf0Pnaa9Ds5Krl58MTU0NDU2NzkzNEAxNTQ0NDgxNTM0&q=http%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fwayneradiotv'>http://twitch.tv/wayneradiotv</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Wayne:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=oXc0N8vkC0k&event=video_description&redir_token=zS1lmqIIVGyqqf0Pnaa9Ds5Krl58MTU0NDU2NzkzNEAxNTQ0NDgxNTM0&q=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fwayneradiotv'>https://twitter.com/wayneradiotv</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=oXc0N8vkC0k&event=video_description&redir_token=zS1lmqIIVGyqqf0Pnaa9Ds5Krl58MTU0NDU2NzkzNEAxNTQ0NDgxNTM0&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwayneradiotv.tumblr.com%2F'>https://wayneradiotv.tumblr.com/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Baaulp:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='https://twitter.com/Baaulp'>https://twitter.com/Baaulp</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='https://baaulp.tumblr.com/'>https://baaulp.tumblr.com/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Log:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='https://twitter.com/Logblaster'>https://twitter.com/Logblaster</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='http://logmore.tumblr.com/'>http://logmore.tumblr.com/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Trog:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='https://twitter.com/Trogort'>https://twitter.com/Trogort</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='http://trogort.tumblr.com/'>http://trogort.tumblr.com/</a></p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\">Gir:</p>\n<p style=\"text-align:left;\"><a href='https://twitter.com/MasterGir'>https://twitter.com/MasterGir</a></p>\n<p>\u00a0</p>",

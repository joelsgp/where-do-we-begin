0:00:18.340,0:00:30.710
Wayne: Okay, now introduce Gir.

0:00:30.710,0:00:34.239
Gir: I go—I usually go last, but… I’m
Gir.

0:00:34.239,0:00:36.720
Trog, laughing: We don’t even remember the
order.

0:00:36.720,0:00:37.840
[Baaulp laughs]

0:00:37.840,0:00:39.530
Baaulp: I’m Baaulp.

0:00:39.530,0:00:43.131
Log: And they call me Log, the Devil’s Mystery.

0:00:43.131,0:00:44.460
Wayne: The—the final member.

0:00:44.460,0:00:46.050
Baaulp: The Devil’s Mystery…

0:00:46.050,0:00:49.790
Wayne: Welcome, it’s another-it’s another
fantastic episode of the Where Do We Begin

0:00:49.790,0:00:53.719
podcast, and uh, tonight we have all kinds
of topics and merriment and mirth to share

0:00:53.719,0:00:58.870
with you. Uh, it has been three months since
our last episode, since our last episode was

0:00:58.870,0:01:02.180
both recorded and released. It’s been a
long time, we got a lot to talk about!

0:01:02.180,0:01:04.600
Log: It’s been like a little summer time
capsule.

0:01:04.600,0:01:08.860
Wayne: The review it is-it is—this is the
episode of the summer. We’re gonna talk

0:01:08.860,0:01:09.860
all about the—

0:01:09.860,0:01:10.860
Trog: Mhmm.

0:01:10.860,0:01:11.860
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:01:11.860,0:01:12.860
Wayne: —We’re gonna talk about the sun,
we’re gonna talk all

0:01:12.860,0:01:13.860
about the beach that we didn’t go to.

0:01:13.860,0:01:17.990
Trog: It is literally the episode of the summer.
There will not be another episode of this

0:01:17.990,0:01:20.049
podcast recorded in summer of 2020.

0:01:20.049,0:01:24.250
Wayne: [Laughs] I mean, summer-summer goes—summer
goes into September. So like, if we do an

0:01:24.250,0:01:25.479
early September episode…

0:01:25.479,0:01:26.560
Trog: Oh, maybe. Yeah.

0:01:26.560,0:01:31.001
Wayne: Y’know, that’s fucked up. Summer
should end when September starts. I think-I

0:01:31.001,0:01:35.409
think it’s dumb that seasons go into months
that are not attributed to those seasons.

0:01:35.409,0:01:36.409
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] What? What? What are you—what?

0:01:36.409,0:01:39.670
Wayne: September is the fall to me. Like,
as soon as it’s early September, that’s

0:01:39.670,0:01:40.670
fall.

0:01:40.670,0:01:42.430
Log: August is fall, practically. Like—

0:01:42.430,0:01:46.340
Wayne: Really? No, August is summer! August
is the hottest month.

0:01:46.340,0:01:49.060
Log: June and July are summer months and that’s
all I know.

0:01:49.060,0:01:50.270
Gir: Yeah, you’re out of your mind.

0:01:50.270,0:01:56.140
Log: May, June, July, that sounds like summer.
August—August sounds like tree leaves turning

0:01:56.140,0:01:57.229
orange and red.

0:01:57.229,0:01:58.610
Wayne: That’s wild, what? Wha—wha—

0:01:58.610,0:02:00.530
Gir: You’re wrong. I mean, you’re wrong.

0:02:00.530,0:02:01.850
Trog: That’s literally incorrect.

0:02:01.850,0:02:03.509
Log: It sounds that—like that don’t-don’t
it?

0:02:03.509,0:02:04.930
Wayne: [Crosstalk] It’s not! No! That’s
September!

0:02:04.930,0:02:06.560
Gir: [Crosstalk] No, it doesn’t sound like
that!

0:02:06.560,0:02:08.819
Log: Think about-think about the words and
how they feel.

0:02:08.819,0:02:12.700
Wayne: That’s when—that’s when—that’s
when the -bers start. When the-when the -bers

0:02:12.700,0:02:16.350
start, that’s when the leaves come down.
That’s-that’s September, October, November.

0:02:16.350,0:02:20.470
Gir: The word August does not convey win—uh,
fall to me.

0:02:20.470,0:02:22.819
Log: Indiana was like that in August. I’m…
[unintelligible]

0:02:22.819,0:02:26.890
Wayne: August sounds like hot. August sounds
like hot and heat and ice cream and—and

0:02:26.890,0:02:27.890
waves.

0:02:27.890,0:02:29.510
Gir: It sounds like, “Ah gosh, it’s hot
outside.”

0:02:29.510,0:02:33.489
Log: August sounds cold—the word August
sounds colder than many other months.

0:02:33.489,0:02:34.670
Trog: You know, I kind of agree.

0:02:34.670,0:02:36.550
Wayne: The fuck are you talk—you’re crazy!

0:02:36.550,0:02:41.269
Trog: As somebody who lives in Texas where
it’s like a hundred degrees every fucking

0:02:41.269,0:02:46.319
day during this month, I would be down with
summer just kind of being the beginning of

0:02:46.319,0:02:48.240
June and that’s it. And it just goes away.

0:02:48.240,0:02:49.240
[Wayne laughs]

0:02:49.240,0:02:52.870
Trog: It’s just really hot, it’s like
nineties for a couple weeks then it goes back

0:02:52.870,0:02:53.870
down.

0:02:53.870,0:02:57.600
Gir: Oh, cry me a fucking river, I’m sitting
over here with my fuckin’ hundred and thirteen

0:02:57.600,0:03:01.489
degrees when I step outside. Choke to death
as soon as I step out the door.

0:03:01.489,0:03:03.810
Wayne: Just bring a—just bring a wet towel
and douse yourself.

0:03:03.810,0:03:07.030
Baaulp: You can’t blame us for all the sin
making Vegas hot.

0:03:07.030,0:03:08.069
[Wayne makes a smug sound of approval]

0:03:08.069,0:03:09.160
Trog: Yeah, get further away from Hell.

0:03:09.160,0:03:12.300
Gir: There’s so much less sin here than
there usually is, though.

0:03:12.300,0:03:16.050
Baaulp: Yeah. Yeah, it’s hot because you’re
closer to Hell ‘cause all the sin, and the

0:03:16.050,0:03:17.050
debauchery.

0:03:17.050,0:03:20.790
Wayne: Gir, I promise you that once you start
being a good boy and you stop all that sinnin’,

0:03:20.790,0:03:21.980
it’ll cool down.

0:03:21.980,0:03:23.790
Gir: [Crosstalk] I am good! I’ve never done
anything

0:03:23.790,0:03:24.790
wrong.

0:03:24.790,0:03:25.870
Wayne: The Devil—the Devil’s gaze—the
Devil’s gaze will go elsewhere and it’ll

0:03:25.870,0:03:26.870
cool down.

0:03:26.870,0:03:28.660
Log: The magnifying glass will turn away.

0:03:28.660,0:03:31.190
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

0:03:31.190,0:03:36.730
Wayne: [Laughs harder] Imagine God holding
an—Imagine God holding a magnifying glass

0:03:36.730,0:03:38.930
up to you specifically. Like he’s just trying
to burn you.

0:03:38.930,0:03:39.930
[Trog laughs]

0:03:39.930,0:03:41.470
Baaulp: Like he’s burning an ant?

0:03:41.470,0:03:42.470
Trog: Yeah.

0:03:42.470,0:03:43.470
Wayne: Yeah.

0:03:43.470,0:03:44.470
Trog: Just you, specifically.

0:03:44.470,0:03:45.549
Gir: That reminds me of, uh—

0:03:45.549,0:03:46.549
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Die MasterGir.

0:03:46.549,0:03:49.890
Gir: Of uh, I don’t know why, but out of
nowhere I was like, “I’m going to look

0:03:49.890,0:03:53.400
up who’s been struck by lightning more than
anyone else on Earth.” And there’s the—there’s

0:03:53.400,0:03:58.090
the guy who was like a park ranger who got
struck by lightning seven times.

0:03:58.090,0:03:59.090
[Trog laughs]

0:03:59.090,0:04:00.090
Trog: And lived?

0:04:00.090,0:04:01.090
Gir: Yeah.

0:04:01.090,0:04:02.090
Wayne: That guy could do a fuckin’ Electric
Wind God Fist.

0:04:02.090,0:04:03.920
Log, in a deep voice: You need to let those
animals die.

0:04:03.920,0:04:08.670
Gir: After the third time, he started getting
so paranoid that as soon as he heard thunder

0:04:08.670,0:04:09.879
he would just like, hide.

0:04:09.879,0:04:14.310
Trog: Then how did he—Well he didn’t follow
his own advice; how did he get struck four

0:04:14.310,0:04:15.310
more times?

0:04:15.310,0:04:18.740
Wayne: Is there science to it? Like, is the
fact that he was struck and survived, did

0:04:18.740,0:04:22.669
it like electrocharge his body in a way that
like, attracted more lightning?

0:04:22.669,0:04:26.290
Gir: There was science to it in that he was
a park ranger so he was always outside, and

0:04:26.290,0:04:30.000
he was a park ranger in Virginia that has
like, a shitload of thunderstorms.

0:04:30.000,0:04:31.000
Wayne: I guess.

0:04:31.000,0:04:36.850
Baaulp: Damn, I would look for a new job after,
y’know… The second lightning strike [laughs].

0:04:36.850,0:04:39.430
Gir: Yeah, this story doesn’t end happily,
unfortunately.

0:04:39.430,0:04:44.360
Wayne: There has never been a man that deserves
superpowers more than that guy. Like, come

0:04:44.360,0:04:47.840
on, he needs some abilities. Give—Give the
man some abilities!

0:04:47.840,0:04:52.770
Gir: It seemed like by the seventh time he
got struck he just kind of didn’t care anymore.

0:04:52.770,0:04:57.150
He just—he told the story like, he got struck
by lightning and he turned to go to his car

0:04:57.150,0:05:01.740
to fetch the water that puts out his hair
that caught on fire yet again, and uh, he

0:05:01.740,0:05:05.050
got struck while he was fishing and noticed
a bear was trying to steal his fish on his

0:05:05.050,0:05:07.820
way back to his car, and he ran back and hit
the bear with a—with a branch.

0:05:07.820,0:05:10.950
Wayne: Holy shit. This dude’s kind of badass.

0:05:10.950,0:05:11.950
Gir: Yeah, he was.

0:05:11.950,0:05:17.949
Trog: You think maybe he had some kind of
weird, like, genetic predisposition like—

0:05:17.949,0:05:18.949
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

0:05:18.949,0:05:19.949
Trog: Was he like—

0:05:19.949,0:05:23.660
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Some sort of like, natural
electromagnetism that was attracting bolts

0:05:23.660,0:05:24.660
of lightning.

0:05:24.660,0:05:26.930
Trog: Yeah, he just was a living magnet? Like—

0:05:26.930,0:05:31.030
Log: Yeah, your blood is just iron, I don’t
know how it even moves through your body!

0:05:31.030,0:05:32.030
[Baaulp laughs]

0:05:32.030,0:05:33.030
Trog: Not even a liquid.

0:05:33.030,0:05:37.870
Log: That was like a Family Matters episode.
You guys ever watch Family Matters?

0:05:37.870,0:05:38.870
Baaulp: What? No?

0:05:38.870,0:05:40.350
Trog: Probably like, one episode ever.

0:05:40.350,0:05:44.400
Log: There’s an episode where like, I guess
they have like multiple plot points, but one

0:05:44.400,0:05:49.150
of them was that Steve Urkel kept getting
struck by lightning, and he figured out it

0:05:49.150,0:05:52.919
was because there was too much iron in his
blood, so he ran all of his blood through

0:05:52.919,0:05:55.120
a dialysis machine that he built himself.

0:05:55.120,0:06:00.350
Trog: That sounds like… a horrific—like
a—like body horror sitcom.

0:06:00.350,0:06:02.930
Gir: Sounds like a very easy way to get yourself
killed.

0:06:02.930,0:06:07.480
Wayne: Family Matters was fucking crazy. Have
you seen Dark Urkel Tribute?

0:06:07.480,0:06:11.000
Trog: That’s—that’s the only thing I’ve
seen of Family Matters, that’s my entire

0:06:11.000,0:06:12.240
frame of reference. 

0:06:12.240,0:06:13.240
[Wayne laughs]

0:06:13.240,0:06:18.130
Baaulp: I never watched most Family Matters
but, I did know that it devolved into the

0:06:18.130,0:06:19.130
Steve Urkel show.

0:06:19.130,0:06:23.931
Wayne: Out of all those sitcoms—it originally
wasn’t the Steve Urkel show, huh? It was

0:06:23.931,0:06:26.530
more about Carl Winslow and his family.

0:06:26.530,0:06:29.090
Gir: No, he was just like the neighbor or
something.

0:06:29.090,0:06:30.090
Wayne: Yeah.

0:06:30.090,0:06:34.819
Baaulp: Steve Urkel wasn’t even in the family
of Family Matters. He was their neighbor [laughs].

0:06:34.819,0:06:38.180
Trog: Yeah, it was the kind of thing where
it was just a breakaway hit and the exec.

0:06:38.180,0:06:43.840
saw it and was like, “We gotta make fucking
Urkel plush dolls and t-shirts and hats and

0:06:43.840,0:06:48.349
put him in every episode, they can’t get
enough.” The nineties had Urkel fever.

0:06:48.349,0:06:51.180
Wayne: Out of all those sitcoms—out of all
those—out of all

0:06:51.180,0:06:55.070
the sitcoms from that era, Family Matters
had the best theme song by far. By far.

0:06:55.070,0:06:57.860
Trog: And then—and then Urkel, he became
Sonic.

0:06:57.860,0:07:03.450
Log: When you get down to it, though, it’s
like they kind of had to do it. They fucked

0:07:03.450,0:07:08.340
up because they didn’t have like, the best
character in the family, and so they just

0:07:08.340,0:07:13.569
had to—they had to do it. It’s not like—it’s
not like Fresh Prince y’know, where like,

0:07:13.569,0:07:21.500
every character was good, like Family Matters
I feel like it was Carl Winslow and Steve

0:07:21.500,0:07:23.410
Urkel. And like, that was the show.

0:07:23.410,0:07:24.410
Wayne: Yeah.

0:07:24.410,0:07:28.050
Baaulp: See, if that’s the thing, they should
have just made a spin off. Like fuck it, end

0:07:28.050,0:07:33.510
the original show, have a spin off. Have a
spin off—have a spin off where it’s five

0:07:33.510,0:07:38.160
Urkels, have a spin off where Urkel clones
himself four times, and it’s a house of

0:07:38.160,0:07:39.160
Urkels.

0:07:39.160,0:07:40.419
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:07:40.419,0:07:45.889
Wayne: Hey everybody, we’re back! I hope
you enjoyed one thirty seconds of Family Matters

0:07:45.889,0:07:50.820
talk, because now we’ve had to restart the
episode uh, we had a little problem, uh, my

0:07:50.820,0:07:56.370
recording software crashed. Uh, and we—we
then talked for about twenty minutes, so we

0:07:56.370,0:08:00.020
lost a big chunk of discussion. We talked
about Rogue of Legacy 2, we talked about Fall

0:08:00.020,0:08:04.980
Guys, we talked about Steve Urkel, it was
really funny, um, and really insightful.

0:08:04.980,0:08:06.260
Trog: You’ll never hear it!

0:08:06.260,0:08:07.460
Wayne: You’ll never hear it.

0:08:07.460,0:08:08.460
Baaulp: Just imagine it!

0:08:08.460,0:08:14.250
Log: I was dominating the conversation, right?
I swerved it into Family Matters and started

0:08:14.250,0:08:17.550
talking about One Piece. Like, it was—it
was, uh—

0:08:17.550,0:08:19.990
Wayne: Hey. Give me some credit. I brought
up Igaram.

0:08:19.990,0:08:26.970
Log: It was ten minutes of Logmore precedence,
and we lost it ‘cause Wayne was being a

0:08:26.970,0:08:27.970
little snake.

0:08:27.970,0:08:28.970
Wayne: I didn’t know what happened!

0:08:28.970,0:08:29.970
[Gir laughs]

0:08:29.970,0:08:34.479
Wayne: It didn’t—In the program—Okay,
so, to be fair, to be fair and genuine, I

0:08:34.479,0:08:38.390
have a strange recording setup where I use
OBS to record my audio because I already have

0:08:38.390,0:08:43.890
like, a very good noise gate setup in there,
and normally if OBS crashes it fuckin’ tells

0:08:43.890,0:08:49.200
me! This time, nope, it just wasn’t open.
Just wasn’t open. I just looked down and

0:08:49.200,0:08:53.269
I saw that the—the little button on my start
bar didn’t have a light under it.

0:08:53.269,0:08:55.630
Gir, mockingly: There is no more little button!

0:08:55.630,0:08:56.630
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Buh-bye.

0:08:56.630,0:09:00.170
Baaulp: Alright. Listen, listen, listen. Don’t
ask any questions, I need—I need fanart

0:09:00.170,0:09:03.800
of Nico Robin from One Piece going, [in a
Steve Urkel voice] “Did I do that?”

0:09:03.800,0:09:04.800
[Wayne laughs]

0:09:04.800,0:09:09.170
Trog: No context given. You just have to trust
us it was really funny at the time.

0:09:09.170,0:09:10.170
Gir: You’ll figure it out.

0:09:10.170,0:09:12.370
Wayne: One day you'll realize the true nature
of this request.

0:09:12.370,0:09:17.760
Log: Yeah, need a Urkle and One Piece kwosh...
Urkle and one piece crossover.

0:09:17.760,0:09:23.050
Wayne: It has been quite some time, since
we've recorded a podcast, and a lot of stuff

0:09:23.050,0:09:29.390
has happened! We've been playing a lot of
games, the, uh... we've done all kinds of

0:09:29.390,0:09:33.120
streams, all kinds of great content for you
guys, but podcast has been getting neglected,

0:09:33.120,0:09:37.310
because we've been working so hard on other
stuff. We put together a very fun production

0:09:37.310,0:09:44.850
a few weeks ago called AI-adventure Call,
spearheaded by our-- by our fantastic dog

0:09:44.850,0:09:46.100
producer, Trog.

0:09:46.100,0:09:47.339
Trog: Woo.

0:09:47.339,0:09:50.100
Wayne: Thank you Trog, you did an amazing
job.

0:09:50.100,0:09:51.100
Trog: Thank you, yeah.

0:09:51.100,0:09:52.100
Wayne: I just wanna talk about it a little
bit.

0:09:52.100,0:09:53.100
Trog: Nah, I'm into it.

0:09:53.100,0:09:56.450
Wayne: Yeah, Trog- Trog had the original idea
to do something along the lines of Adventure

0:09:56.450,0:10:02.230
Call from Limmy Show. And, uh, I, and he was
talking about setting something up and doing

0:10:02.230,0:10:06.300
it on his stream, but I was like, I tugged
on his shirt and I was like, "Yo, let me,

0:10:06.300,0:10:12.700
let me buy a costume, let me play a character."
And then we turned it into a much larger production,

0:10:12.700,0:10:15.709
and it became- it was fuckin' huge! It was
awesome.

0:10:15.709,0:10:22.550
Trog: In case you don't know what Adventure
Call from Limmy Show is, it is a series of

0:10:22.550,0:10:28.440
skits in which Limmy, who is a comedian, who
has a comedy sketch show, or had a comedy

0:10:28.440,0:10:38.440
sketch show, dresses up like a fantasy man,
and hosts a call-in program where you must

0:10:38.440,0:10:39.870
best a dungeon.

0:10:39.870,0:10:41.470
Wayne: Is he like a satyr?

0:10:41.470,0:10:42.470
Log: He's like a bard.

0:10:42.470,0:10:44.720
Wayne: [Laughs] He kinda looks like a satyr.

0:10:44.720,0:10:47.650
Log: He's more of a, just a general bard,
or a minstrel-

0:10:47.650,0:10:54.130
Trog: Yeah, he's kinda just like a dude, but,
um so that was the idea. I was, so like I

0:10:54.130,0:10:59.910
had, like, we all love those sketches. Those
sketches are great, and um, we also happen

0:10:59.910,0:11:04.389
to all really enjoy AI dungeon as a concept.
And I feel like it was just-

0:11:04.389,0:11:05.790
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Oh, yeah. It's Trog's game
of the year!

0:11:05.790,0:11:10.540
Trog: It was pretty obvious to me to just
be like, “Why don’t we just do that, like,

0:11:10.540,0:11:17.339
why don’t we just combine these two funny
ideas into one.” And so, the idea was born.

0:11:17.339,0:11:22.681
And then Wayne bought a bunch of dumb bullshit
on Amazon that like, honestly, whenever you

0:11:22.681,0:11:26.360
put that costume on, you transformed into
a different human. It was like, scary.

0:11:26.360,0:11:28.330
Wayne: [Laughs] It was awesome!

0:11:28.330,0:11:30.310
Trog: You didn’t look like you.

0:11:30.310,0:11:33.660
Wayne: It was my—it’s my favorite costume
that I’ve put together yet.

0:11:33.660,0:11:34.660
Trog: [Crosstalk] I think it’s my favorite
as well.

0:11:34.660,0:11:38.500
Wayne: I’ve done a ton of different costumes—I’ve
done a ton of different costumes for like,

0:11:38.500,0:11:44.010
little bits here and there, we—there’s
a caveman—like, my fuckin’, my closet—honestly,

0:11:44.010,0:11:48.190
I love stocking up on dumb costume items because
my closet is just full of shit. I could put

0:11:48.190,0:11:53.360
together like, so many costumes by combining
them, there’s a caveman, there’s the—uh,

0:11:53.360,0:11:57.470
there’s not really a vague term to describe
what the Fushigi Freak is.

0:11:57.470,0:11:58.470
Trog, laughing: Morpheus.

0:11:58.470,0:12:02.390
Wayne: Uh, but, there’s that. There’s
the Morpheus-like—Morpheus-like individual.

0:12:02.390,0:12:07.460
There’s, uh, I have—I have face paint
for like a robot costume. I’ve got a morph

0:12:07.460,0:12:10.779
suit, I got—I got a knight’s outfit, there’s
a costume in there I can’t tell you about

0:12:10.779,0:12:17.250
yet. The, like, all kinds of shit. The—And,
but this costume, I think the number one thing

0:12:17.250,0:12:19.990
was like when we had this idea, I think the
first thing, like when we were in the voicecall

0:12:19.990,0:12:23.610
that we all marveled at was like, I think
someone said, “Wayne, you should buy chainmail,”

0:12:23.610,0:12:24.610
and then it began.

0:12:24.610,0:12:25.610
Trog: Yeah.

0:12:25.610,0:12:29.829
Wayne: The—the chainmail was the—it was
the centerpiece. It was the—it was like

0:12:29.829,0:12:36.300
the main clip that held it all together. Uh,
and then Scorpy found the beautiful five dollar

0:12:36.300,0:12:37.300
goatee.

0:12:37.300,0:12:38.300
[Baaulp laughs]

0:12:38.300,0:12:41.449
Gir: That—that thing I think was the real
centerpiece if—in my opinion.

0:12:41.449,0:12:44.810
Wayne: It worked with the chainmail. Those—those
two together is what transformed me.

0:12:44.810,0:12:45.810
Gir: The gems on the crown.

0:12:45.810,0:12:46.810
[Wayne laughs]

0:12:46.810,0:12:47.810
Trog: So to speak.

0:12:47.810,0:12:52.270
Log: Yeah, it was really good. Y’know, I—I
forget, I don’t really think about how easily

0:12:52.270,0:12:57.580
accessible Limmy is, now. I wonder if that—I
wonder if these clips have like, gotten to

0:12:57.580,0:12:58.780
him in any way.

0:12:58.780,0:13:01.389
Gir: I highly, highly, highly doubt it.

0:13:01.389,0:13:07.010
Trog: I will one hundred percent admit that
it was like, that that—that was not an original

0:13:07.010,0:13:12.829
idea, that was two ideas that already existed
that I thought it would be fun to combine.

0:13:12.829,0:13:18.070
I—I one hundred percent give the original
credit for that, that inspiration, to those

0:13:18.070,0:13:19.360
Limmy show sketches.

0:13:19.360,0:13:24.690
Baaulp: I talked to other streamers, and like,
other people who like, are—we’ve set a—I

0:13:24.690,0:13:29.279
think we’ve set a trend! I’ve seen people—more
and more people stream AI Dungeon, and—and

0:13:29.279,0:13:30.750
like, but they say like—

0:13:30.750,0:13:34.149
Wayne: We’re not the only ones. There’s
bigger streamers than us that do it.

0:13:34.149,0:13:35.149
Baaulp: Well—

0:13:35.149,0:13:37.300
Wayne: But nobody’s doing anything like
AI-dventure Call. That was—

0:13:37.300,0:13:39.440
Trog: That’s true. That’s unique. We’re
raising the bar.

0:13:39.440,0:13:42.800
Baaulp: I’ve talked to people and they’re
like, “Yeah, at the end of the day, it is

0:13:42.800,0:13:45.800
a text adventure. I wonder if we could make
it more exciting.” Hey, we figured it out

0:13:45.800,0:13:46.800
[laughs].

0:13:46.800,0:13:51.360
Wayne: And we have other ideas that we haven’t
even done yet! The, like, the-the-the-the

0:13:51.360,0:13:55.780
thing with—the thing with like, the reason
that while the idea is a hundred percent Limmy’s,

0:13:55.780,0:14:00.750
the reason why it’s like, we, like, our
spin on it is like, valid and justified, is

0:14:00.750,0:14:06.630
like, with the Adventure Call on Limmy’s
show, those were like, skits. We put on, like,

0:14:06.630,0:14:11.811
an actual like, essentially what would have
been an episode of a TV show. Like, it was

0:14:11.811,0:14:16.620
like a three hour long thing rather than just
like a showcase of like their really funny

0:14:16.620,0:14:19.510
gags. And I don’t mean to downplay Adventure
Call, that shit’s still hilarious.

0:14:19.510,0:14:22.370
Trog: No, I mean it’s-it’s completely
different, right? Because the Adventure Call

0:14:22.370,0:14:28.540
skits, they are skits, they are written, it
is a script. The AI Dungeon thing, by the

0:14:28.540,0:14:34.589
nature of AI Dungeon, it cannot be prewritten,
like, we-we basically went into it with like,

0:14:34.589,0:14:41.730
okay, we’re like—all of the contestants
are gonna kind of have like, their own mini-bit

0:14:41.730,0:14:44.740
that they’re doing, but there’s—it’s
all improv, like everything we do, basically.

0:14:44.740,0:14:50.730
It’s all just improv in the end, so. It’s
different enough that it’s not like we’re

0:14:50.730,0:14:52.540
ripping it off. It’s an homage.

0:14:52.540,0:14:55.050
Baaulp: The only gag that wasn’t improv
was the tuna.

0:14:55.050,0:14:56.139
Gir: Oh, yeah, the tuna.

0:14:56.139,0:14:58.870
Trog, laughing: The tuna? Oh—oh, the grand
prize.

0:14:58.870,0:15:03.190
Wayne: Like, we were joking about, like, I
think it was supposed to be beans at first,

0:15:03.190,0:15:06.730
like, ‘cause—‘cause we’d been watching
like Legends of the Hidden Temple, and Legend—

0:15:06.730,0:15:07.730
Trog: Oh, yeah.

0:15:07.730,0:15:09.690
Log: Tuna was the prize in Legends of the
Hidden Temple.

0:15:09.690,0:15:13.860
Wayne: It was! Legends—Legends of the Hidden
Temple was like, we’d-we’d been—we-we

0:15:13.860,0:15:18.639
were watching it at one point occasionally,
and that show, if you lose on that show, which

0:15:18.639,0:15:24.240
most kids do, your prize is so fuckin’ sad.
They give you like, a book with a holographic

0:15:24.240,0:15:29.700
cover, or like, a can of tuna. Genuinely!
A can of fucking tuna.

0:15:29.700,0:15:32.190
Gir: Here’s a backpack! Enjoy!

0:15:32.190,0:15:38.880
Wayne: A backpack! Shoes that might—they
have a plastic strap on them instead of Velcro!

0:15:38.880,0:15:40.170
Like, it’s just—

0:15:40.170,0:15:41.170
[Baaulp laughs]

0:15:41.170,0:15:43.640
Wayne: Or you—[Laughs] Did anyone else hear
that?

0:15:43.640,0:15:44.640
Baaulp: Wha—what? What was it?

0:15:44.640,0:15:46.120
Gir: [Laughs] Yes, I was like, who’s strangling
a cat!?

0:15:46.120,0:15:50.540
Wayne: Baaulp you were like, holding in a
laugh, and it—we just heard like [high pitch

0:15:50.540,0:15:51.540
inhale sounds].

0:15:51.540,0:15:53.079
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:15:53.079,0:15:55.079
Baaulp: My laughs can get pretty fucked up.

0:15:55.079,0:15:56.639
Wayne: You charge ‘em up.

0:15:56.639,0:16:00.949
Baaulp: Wha—what was the—what was the
slogan for the shoes? Like, wasn’t the slogan

0:16:00.949,0:16:03.310
like, “Get Ready to Devolve,” or some
shit?

0:16:03.310,0:16:07.680
Wayne: Yeah it was like, “Time to Mutate,”
it was, “Time to Mutate!”

0:16:07.680,0:16:09.470
[Log and Trog laugh]

0:16:09.470,0:16:11.699
Baaulp: Yes! It was, “Time to Mutate!”
What the fuck?

0:16:11.699,0:16:14.139
Gir: That’s a terrible slogan.

0:16:14.139,0:16:15.610
Log: Typical nineties.

0:16:15.610,0:16:20.980
Wayne: It was literally just—it was just
a sneaker for kids with like, a zip tie on

0:16:20.980,0:16:21.980
it.

0:16:21.980,0:16:22.980
Baaulp, laughing: Yeah.

0:16:22.980,0:16:25.190
Wayne: Like, I’m pretty sure it was just
a zip tie. And then the—so, the slogan was

0:16:25.190,0:16:29.139
“Time to Mutate,” and the video, the commercial
was like, it was like a stop motion of a kid

0:16:29.139,0:16:32.920
standing in like a walking position and just
moving with the stop motion, and—

0:16:32.920,0:16:34.740
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah, and they were like
in an empty warehouse.

0:16:34.740,0:16:37.271
Wayne: — I think-I think there was like,
Scorpy—Scorpy said like, “Yeah, if I saw

0:16:37.271,0:16:39.839
them when I was a kid, I would think that
like, that was a shoe that—that made it

0:16:39.839,0:16:42.260
so you didn’t have to pick up your feet.
Like, you’d just do that.”

0:16:42.260,0:16:43.260
[Baaulp laughs]

0:16:43.260,0:16:45.529
Gir: I thought it was those like, rollerblade
shoes at first.

0:16:45.529,0:16:46.529
Wayne: Yeah, like Heelys!

0:16:46.529,0:16:47.529
Gir: Yeah, exactly.

0:16:47.529,0:16:52.700
Trog: Yeah. I would say the AI Adventure Call
thing, we were—we were y’know, Limmy’s

0:16:52.700,0:16:55.390
show, and just like call-in shows in general—

0:16:55.390,0:16:56.390
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Yeah, public access.

0:16:56.390,0:17:02.839
Trog: —and then also we’ve just been watching
like, a handful of nineties gameshows at the

0:17:02.839,0:17:08.260
time, we-we were like, we were watching Supermarket
Sweep and Legends of the Hidden Temple, and

0:17:08.260,0:17:09.589
I think Gack?

0:17:09.589,0:17:11.270
Wayne: Did—I didn’t watch Gack.

0:17:11.270,0:17:14.640
Trog: I think we watched a couple epi—or
GUTS, that’s what it was, not Gack.

0:17:14.640,0:17:18.110
Wayne: In the past we used to—we used to
watch the shows that were more akin to like,

0:17:18.110,0:17:19.789
the fantasy type shit, like—like Knightmare.

0:17:19.789,0:17:20.789
Trog: Oh, yeah, yeah.

0:17:20.789,0:17:23.740
Wayne: Like, which, if you don’t know what
Knightmare is, Knightmare is probably one

0:17:23.740,0:17:28.120
of the funniest things to ever air on TV in
earnest, which is like, it’s a show where

0:17:28.120,0:17:33.570
kids would like, they would put a bucket on
a kid’s head and make him stand in a room

0:17:33.570,0:17:37.720
with a greenscreen while other kids would
guide him through the greenscreen room.

0:17:37.720,0:17:38.720
Trog: [Crosstalk] Oh man.

0:17:38.720,0:17:39.720
[Baaulp laughs]

0:17:39.720,0:17:40.720
Baaulp: Yeah!

0:17:40.720,0:17:41.720
Gir: What? I’ve never heard of this show.

0:17:41.720,0:17:42.720
Trog: Oh, you didn’t watch those with us?

0:17:42.720,0:17:46.980
Log: They put a child in a diving bell and
the other ones have to—have to provide direction

0:17:46.980,0:17:48.270
via like, intercom.

0:17:48.270,0:17:50.810
Trog: We have to rewatch those. We have to
rewatch those.

0:17:50.810,0:17:57.080
Baaulp: It is a very British take on the Nickelodeon
type gameshows for kids where it’s like,

0:17:57.080,0:18:01.790
“Okay, we can build an extravagant set,
or, we can just greenscreen everything and

0:18:01.790,0:18:08.670
use matte paintings.” “Well, but then
the kid just sees green.” “Well, okay,

0:18:08.670,0:18:14.390
well, y’know, maybe we have like, people
in green suits jumping around and we just

0:18:14.390,0:18:18.640
tell the kids beforehand that y’know, hey
listen, it’s for the show, you’re only

0:18:18.640,0:18:22.880
going to see green, just use your imagination.”
“No, let’s just put a bucket on their

0:18:22.880,0:18:26.390
head so they don’t see anything!” Like—[laughs].

0:18:26.390,0:18:30.560
Wayne: [Laughs] It’s like—it’s like
literally a bucket. It’s—

0:18:30.560,0:18:31.640
Trog: They can’t-they can’t witness it.

0:18:31.640,0:18:34.670
Wayne: It’s actually a bucket. It might
have some like paint on it or something to

0:18:34.670,0:18:35.670
make it look like a helmet—

0:18:35.670,0:18:37.010
Trog: It’s supposed to be a helmet.

0:18:37.010,0:18:38.380
Baaulp: Yeah, it’s a bucket! [Laughs]

0:18:38.380,0:18:42.180
Wayne: But it’s like—but it’s like—the
kid-the kid can see out the bottom like a

0:18:42.180,0:18:43.180
bucket.

0:18:43.180,0:18:48.240
Log: It’s just incredibly funny because
like, because of this, because the kid can’t

0:18:48.240,0:18:53.850
see anything and it’s all greenscreen, they’re
like, in very dire situations during the show

0:18:53.850,0:18:55.580
like-like you walk into—

0:18:55.580,0:18:56.580
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

0:18:56.580,0:19:00.070
Log: —Like they walk into the wrong room
and their-their like—their skin evaporates

0:19:00.070,0:19:05.020
or something and it just shows a little animation
of like, skin going away from a head and leaving

0:19:05.020,0:19:06.460
a skull, and the skull explodes.

0:19:06.460,0:19:07.720
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

0:19:07.720,0:19:11.810
Log: It’s like, oh, the kid doesn’t—like
the kid’s just standing there, y’know.

0:19:11.810,0:19:12.810
Baaulp, laughing: Yeah!

0:19:12.810,0:19:16.650
Log: Like-like, if they-if they lose—If
they lose they’re not even gonna know, they’re

0:19:16.650,0:19:18.860
gonna like fall off a pit but they’re just
standing there.

0:19:18.860,0:19:22.490
Wayne: And then his guides are like, “Sorry
Jimmy, your face melted.”

0:19:22.490,0:19:23.490
[Baaulp laughs]

0:19:23.490,0:19:26.650
Trog: Exactly. It’s a combination of like,
the kid with the bucket on his head has no

0:19:26.650,0:19:27.650
agency, right? It’s like—

0:19:27.650,0:19:28.650
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:19:28.650,0:19:31.360
Trog: Okay, it’s the kid with the bucket
on his head and then it’s like their three

0:19:31.360,0:19:37.270
friends like, looking at a little CRT monitor
with the computer graphics on it trying to

0:19:37.270,0:19:41.860
like, direct them. So, it’s a combination
of the kid with the bucket could be dumb,

0:19:41.860,0:19:46.570
and also it’s like, kids trying to give
directions. Like, like little—

0:19:46.570,0:19:47.630
Wayne: It’s great.

0:19:47.630,0:19:52.470
Trog: Like, small kids. Not like—I would
say probably like, grade school, right? Like,

0:19:52.470,0:19:53.500
first through fifth grade.

0:19:53.500,0:19:59.370
Wayne: You will have the child-like, the chi—the
only capable in a child error where like,

0:19:59.370,0:20:02.600
the guide—the British guide kid will go
like, “Left! Left!” And the kid will just

0:20:02.600,0:20:03.970
clearly, obviously step to the right, like—

0:20:03.970,0:20:04.970
Trog: Yeah.

0:20:04.970,0:20:08.590
Wayne: There’s just like, there’s both-there’s
both an inability to create directions, and

0:20:08.590,0:20:11.919
an inability to process them in the correct
way.

0:20:11.919,0:20:16.510
Baaulp: It’s been a long while since we
watched that show, but I distinctly remember

0:20:16.510,0:20:20.290
this happening a lot, they’d be like, [in
a British accent] “Okay Daniel, you’re-you’re

0:20:20.290,0:20:27.571
in a room with—and with a-with lava underneath
and you’ve got to pass this bridge but it’s

0:20:27.571,0:20:32.490
not a straight shot so I’ll be guiding you.
Okay, move—step to your right.” “My

0:20:32.490,0:20:34.410
right or your right?” [Laughs]

0:20:34.410,0:20:36.720
Trog, laughing: “What do you mean?”

0:20:36.720,0:20:41.330
Wayne: Yeah, yeah! They could-they could never
translate that difference. Like, it was so

0:20:41.330,0:20:42.330
difficult.

0:20:42.330,0:20:46.140
Gir: Ah, this is actually starting to sound
familiar. I think, I think I’m like on the

0:20:46.140,0:20:48.770
cusp of remembering exactly what we watched.

0:20:48.770,0:20:51.179
Baaulp: You definitely watched this with—this
shit with us [laughs].

0:20:51.179,0:20:53.000
Trog: We should absolutely rewatch these,
it’s been long enough.

0:20:53.000,0:20:57.520
Wayne: Normally when we have ideas, like for
a good thing to put—like, a good production

0:20:57.520,0:21:00.970
to put on, we keep it to ourselves, but I’m
gonna say this on the podcast because if-if

0:21:00.970,0:21:04.900
this ever happened it would be a long time
from now and most of you will forget, but

0:21:04.900,0:21:06.799
I want to just do Knightmare.

0:21:06.799,0:21:08.480
Baaulp: You just want to do Knightmare? [Laughs]

0:21:08.480,0:21:11.560
Wayne: Like if-if we could—No, no, ‘cause
let’s say—okay, let’s say we all go—let’s

0:21:11.560,0:21:16.780
say we all go to Vegas, like, we could just
rent like a giant greenscreen room like Jerma

0:21:16.780,0:21:19.700
does, and just do Knightmare. Like, we’d
just have to make the assets.

0:21:19.700,0:21:20.700
Trog: That is true.

0:21:20.700,0:21:26.850
Wayne: It would be so fucking funny, especially
that concept but with like, our sense of humor

0:21:26.850,0:21:29.690
and it being adults, I think would be so good.

0:21:29.690,0:21:32.690
Baaulp: Now would it still be fantasy based?
Or would you pick a different setting?

0:21:32.690,0:21:34.780
Wayne: I think it has—I think it has to
be.

0:21:34.780,0:21:36.170
Baaulp: It has to be fantasy?

0:21:36.170,0:21:37.970
Gir: I think that’s to be determined.

0:21:37.970,0:21:41.160
Wayne: To be determined. I think—I think
fantasy’s the funniest, though.

0:21:41.160,0:21:44.880
Log: I think it should be—I think it should
be Star Trek but you have a bucket on your

0:21:44.880,0:21:45.880
head [laughs].

0:21:45.880,0:21:47.659
[Wayne, Baaulp, Trog and Gir laugh]

0:21:47.659,0:21:49.870
Baaulp: Oh my god that’s so good!

0:21:49.870,0:21:53.809
Wayne: “There’s a Romulan ahead, aim your
phaser to the left, no-no-a little-no, to

0:21:53.809,0:21:54.809
the right, ah.”

0:21:54.809,0:21:55.809
Gir: “To your—no.”

0:21:55.809,0:21:56.970
Baaulp: “My left or your left?”

0:21:56.970,0:21:58.010
Wayne: Ugh. Ohh.

0:21:58.010,0:21:59.760
Trog: That’d be good. Someday.

0:21:59.760,0:22:03.630
Log: “You have to reach the engineering
room, it’s not a straight shot, though.”

0:22:03.630,0:22:07.390
Wayne: There’s just like, holes in the floor,
like it’s the Star Trek Enterprise but there’s

0:22:07.390,0:22:08.390
just—

0:22:08.390,0:22:09.390
[Baaulp laughs]

0:22:09.390,0:22:11.279
Wayne: —like, that’s the kind of obstacles
that the kids in Knightmare had to face! It

0:22:11.279,0:22:15.140
wasn’t just like, there’s like a trap
you need to—you need to like disarm it,

0:22:15.140,0:22:18.590
or you need to like move past this goblin,
it would literally be like, they’d have

0:22:18.590,0:22:23.429
to walk along a narrow bridge, and if they
walked too far to the left they would just

0:22:23.429,0:22:26.850
like drop the greenscreen footage, they would
just pan it downwards so it looked like the

0:22:26.850,0:22:28.210
kid fell, like—

0:22:28.210,0:22:34.110
Baaulp: “Alright Trog, uh, you’re at Ten
Forward, Guinan wants to talk to you, okay?”

0:22:34.110,0:22:35.110
[Wayne laughs]

0:22:35.110,0:22:38.990
Baaulp: “Alright, take a step forward, okay,
you’re not a-you’re—no, you’re not

0:22:38.990,0:22:39.990
at the bar yet—"

0:22:39.990,0:22:41.130
Wayne: “You walked in the Holodeck.”

0:22:41.130,0:22:42.130
[Trog laughs]

0:22:42.130,0:22:46.100
Log: “The Enterprise is-is going to Starbase
74 for maintenance, there are holes in the

0:22:46.100,0:22:47.100
ground of [unintelligible].”

0:22:47.100,0:22:48.100
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

0:22:48.100,0:22:54.500
Wayne: Yeah, I think taking-taking the concepts
that are present in Knightmare, like just

0:22:54.500,0:22:57.351
random holes in the ground, and putting them
in a place where they shouldn’t be is a

0:22:57.351,0:22:58.351
great idea.

0:22:58.351,0:23:01.960
Gir: “Ah, sorry buddy, you clipped through
the floor, there was a space anomaly you didn’t

0:23:01.960,0:23:02.960
see.”

0:23:02.960,0:23:03.960
[Wayne laughs]

0:23:03.960,0:23:06.990
Baaulp: “There’s a room with three Klingons
and they’re like, really angry. Okay, you’re

0:23:06.990,0:23:13.400
gonna have to fight ‘em. Oh, dodge right!
Dodge right-dodge right! Oh, well, you got

0:23:13.400,0:23:14.400
stabbed.”

0:23:14.400,0:23:15.620
Wayne: “Watch out it’s the Borg, he’s
shooting at you!”

0:23:15.620,0:23:21.510
Trog: I could have sworn that there was like,
s—I could be misremembering this, because

0:23:21.510,0:23:24.340
it’s been a long time since we’ve watched
this, but I could have sworn there was like

0:23:24.340,0:23:31.330
a-a room, that had like, like something rotating
in the middle that they had to jump over,

0:23:31.330,0:23:32.400
but it’s not real. Like, it’s like—

0:23:32.400,0:23:33.400
Baaulp: Yes!

0:23:33.400,0:23:34.400
Wayne: I do remember that.

0:23:34.400,0:23:38.409
Trog: —They just had to tell them, “Okay,
jump now.” And it’s like, this seems impossible.

0:23:38.409,0:23:41.850
Like yeah, ok, maybe the kids aren’t the
best at giving directions, but this gameshow

0:23:41.850,0:23:44.040
is like, rigged as well.

0:23:44.040,0:23:49.110
Wayne: I remember is-isn’t there—I remember
there’s like a talking wall that like, they-they

0:23:49.110,0:23:51.890
would like walk into a room and there’d
be like a talking wall and it would like ask

0:23:51.890,0:23:55.290
a riddle and if you just got it wrong three
times he just killed you.

0:23:55.290,0:23:56.290
[Baaulp laughs]

0:23:56.290,0:23:58.020
Gir: Everyone’s got that wall in their house.

0:23:58.020,0:24:04.340
Baaulp: Like nineties British television for
kids ranged from like insane to kind of awesome.

0:24:04.340,0:24:08.120
I remember there’d be just like a lot of
shows about video games. And not like-not

0:24:08.120,0:24:12.340
like the way G4 was, it was just like, “Oh
yeah, it’d be dope if we just had a Mortal

0:24:12.340,0:24:13.660
Kombat tournament and just invited all these
kids—”

0:24:13.660,0:24:14.660
Log: [Crosstalk] And you had to fight Baraka.

0:24:14.660,0:24:19.620
Baaulp: Yeah, you have to fight Baraka [laughs].
Like, that’s dope! Like, okay!

0:24:19.620,0:24:28.070
Log: Man, oh man. Y’know, there was video
game talk in the uh, the dead recording that—

0:24:28.070,0:24:29.159
Trog: [Crosstalk] The lost episode.

0:24:29.159,0:24:32.809
Log: —of a bygone era, that the lost episode
there was video game talk—There was a lot

0:24:32.809,0:24:34.370
of talk about Fall Gay—Fall—

0:24:34.370,0:24:37.760
[Wayne, Baaulp, Gir, and Trog laugh]

0:24:37.760,0:24:39.450
Trog: Oh, noooo.

0:24:39.450,0:24:41.070
Wayne: Lot of talk about them Fall Gays.

0:24:41.070,0:24:46.020
Log: Yeah, there was a lot of talk about Fall
Guys, um, we’re not gonna talk about that.

0:24:46.020,0:24:49.940
Fuck that. Um, I’ll talk about a game I
played, okay?

0:24:49.940,0:24:50.940
Gir: Okay.

0:24:50.940,0:24:52.980
[A beat of silence before Log laughs a little]

0:24:52.980,0:24:54.090
Gir: Take the reins.

0:24:54.090,0:24:55.090
Log: Do I—Do I have permission?

0:24:55.090,0:24:56.090
Trog: Yeah.

0:24:56.090,0:24:57.450
Log: Okay. Hylics 2 came out a while ago.

0:24:57.450,0:24:58.500
Baaulp: Ohhhhh.

0:24:58.500,0:25:05.279
Log: And I-I started playing it whenever it
came out, and I like, stopped because it didn’t

0:25:05.279,0:25:09.630
have controller support. It had like, half
of a controller support. You could use the

0:25:09.630,0:25:15.982
D-pad and that was it. Um, but then recently
they added controller support to it so I started

0:25:15.982,0:25:21.260
playing it, I started playing it on stream.
That’s a good ole game, I gotta say.

0:25:21.260,0:25:23.780
Baaulp: Nice! Yeah, it looks cool!

0:25:23.780,0:25:29.861
Log: It’s-it’s weird ‘cause the first
Hylics game, like, nothing made sense. Every

0:25:29.861,0:25:32.950
NPC spoke in randomly generated dialogue um—

0:25:32.950,0:25:38.020
Wayne: Yeah, does Hylics 2 still have the
randomly generated bullshit? Like, I liked

0:25:38.020,0:25:39.020
it.

0:25:39.020,0:25:43.930
Log: Nah-no, the-the—Every NPC still like,
talks in bullshit but it’s like, written

0:25:43.930,0:25:45.670
bullshit instead of procedurally generated.

0:25:45.670,0:25:46.670
Gir: Meaningful bullshit.

0:25:46.670,0:25:50.990
Log: Like the—You’ll-you’ll meet a party
member and he says, “I’m looking—I’m-I’m

0:25:50.990,0:25:58.049
at this beach looking for a cabinet.” Um,
but he-but he’ll always say that. Um, so

0:25:58.049,0:26:05.760
it’s good, uh, it’s a turn-based RPG,
the RPG part is pretty hard, um, I thought

0:26:05.760,0:26:11.150
the first boss—There’s just like a whole
bunch of shit that I didn’t expect. Like,

0:26:11.150,0:26:15.610
I was just walking around and I clicked-I
like clicked on a thing and it took me into

0:26:15.610,0:26:17.320
a 2D platformer section—

0:26:17.320,0:26:19.039
Wayne: Yeah. That was in the trailers.

0:26:19.039,0:26:22.450
Log: It’s like-it’s like fuckin’ uh,
it was like Mario and Luigi y’know, Superstar

0:26:22.450,0:26:23.750
Saga they had those little things.

0:26:23.750,0:26:24.750
Wayne: Mhmm.

0:26:24.750,0:26:30.549
Log: It’s like that. Yeah, like, there’s
like alternate ways to like solve the problems

0:26:30.549,0:26:34.890
in areas, surprising. And they started talking
about a gibbylet.

0:26:34.890,0:26:35.890
Gir: Yeah.

0:26:35.890,0:26:36.890
Wayne: What?

0:26:36.890,0:26:37.890
Log: Yeah.

0:26:37.890,0:26:38.890
Trog: What’s that?

0:26:38.890,0:26:40.399
Log: It’s uh, it’s a piece of a gibby.

0:26:40.399,0:26:41.399
Trog: Oh.

0:26:41.399,0:26:42.399
Gir: Sure, man.

0:26:42.399,0:26:46.501
Log: I don’t know, I was just-I was just
pleased to read gibbylet because we s—we

0:26:46.501,0:26:53.120
always talk about joglets and troglets and
here’s a game where now I have to like go

0:26:53.120,0:26:55.299
out and find a gibbylet and kill it.

0:26:55.299,0:26:56.299
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

0:26:56.299,0:27:00.730
Baaulp: So it—so it-so it’s nice to know
Mason Lindroth has the same—is on the same

0:27:00.730,0:27:02.020
wavelength as us, is [what] you’re saying?

0:27:02.020,0:27:03.020
Log: Yeah.

0:27:03.020,0:27:05.049
Gir: I mean, the main character’s name is
Wayne.

0:27:05.049,0:27:06.049
Baaulp: Ooohhhh.

0:27:06.049,0:27:10.820
Wayne: Yeah that’s uh, that’s not a coincidence.
It’s not a coincidence, it’s fully intentional.

0:27:10.820,0:27:11.929
Gir: One hundred percent.

0:27:11.929,0:27:16.980
Trog: It’s not a coincidence because the
person thought of that and chose it. It wasn’t

0:27:16.980,0:27:19.890
pick—It wasn’t determined at complete
random.

0:27:19.890,0:27:23.309
Gir: They didn’t write the name down and
look down and go, “Oh, that’s a good name!”

0:27:23.309,0:27:29.610
Wayne: I played Hylics 1 for a bit, but like,
that game was har—kind of impenetrable,

0:27:29.610,0:27:35.240
like—It was—I just had no clue what I
was fucking doing and I think I died really

0:27:35.240,0:27:38.140
early on and it just like—never touched
it again.

0:27:38.140,0:27:43.490
Log: Oh, yeah. It’s—Hylics 1 and 2 are
like Dungeons and Dragons in that action economy

0:27:43.490,0:27:44.490
is everything.

0:27:44.490,0:27:45.490
Wayne: Yeah.

0:27:45.490,0:27:49.760
Log: Um, Hylics 2 is a lot better in that
it gives you uh, two of your party members

0:27:49.760,0:27:50.760
very early on.

0:27:50.760,0:27:51.760
Wayne: Mhmm.

0:27:51.760,0:27:55.910
Log: Um, in Hylics 1 you’re just kind of
stuck as just Wayne for a long time and you

0:27:55.910,0:27:58.029
get your ass beat by everything.

0:27:58.029,0:28:03.190
Wayne: [Laughs] It’s-It’s—It was hard
as fuck. Um, but yeah, visually that game

0:28:03.190,0:28:08.140
was one of a kind and very, very cool, as
well. I should maybe check out Hylics 2.

0:28:08.140,0:28:16.630
Trog: Talking about weird, like, abstract
video games, I played Anodyne 1 and 2 uh,

0:28:16.630,0:28:21.800
recently. Both games are really good. I would
highly recommend those to anybody who likes

0:28:21.800,0:28:31.149
uh, weird, heady, confusing narrative based
video games with a little bit of puzzles thrown

0:28:31.149,0:28:32.149
in.

0:28:32.149,0:28:35.240
Log: That game is really funny looking, it
looks like the Nickelodeon Movie Maker.

0:28:35.240,0:28:41.900
Trog: A little bit, yeah. I mean, Anodyne
2 is 3D with 2D sections, and Anodyne 1 is

0:28:41.900,0:28:50.760
entirely 2D. Um, but the 3D sections in Anodyne
2 are definitely going for like a retro PS1-ish

0:28:50.760,0:28:52.840
era kind of feel.

0:28:52.840,0:28:56.010
Wayne: Yeah, that's the- I was watching some
of your streams, like I just peeked in and

0:28:56.010,0:29:01.070
out, and like, I saw some of those bits, like,
going between those two different aesthetics-

0:29:01.070,0:29:07.240
the PS1, or like N64 areas lookin' areas were
like really cool. Like, a lot of-- a lot of

0:29:07.240,0:29:11.370
articles 'n' shit and people are talking about
how like, that is- that's the era that we're

0:29:11.370,0:29:18.620
entering? Is like, oh yeah, we just went through
the 16 bit and like 32 bit, sort of, uhh...

0:29:18.620,0:29:23.010
there was that era of nostalgia and like kind
of bringing that aesthetic back, and now we're

0:29:23.010,0:29:28.750
in N64 and PS1 retro style games? And that's
fucking dope, I can't want to see more stuff

0:29:28.750,0:29:29.750
like that.

0:29:29.750,0:29:30.950
Trog: Yeah, to me, that's like, hey. That's...

0:29:30.950,0:29:31.950
Wayne: Prime.

0:29:31.950,0:29:36.860
Trog: I'm all, hit me with that nostalgia
bait for the N64 era because that's when I

0:29:36.860,0:29:41.900
was a kid, and that's what I have nostalgia
for. I've been playing a Banjo-Kazooie ROM

0:29:41.900,0:29:48.050
hack that turns all the areas of Ocarina of
Time into Banjo-Kazooie levels. That's...

0:29:48.050,0:29:49.050
Wayne: I saw!

0:29:49.050,0:29:54.130
Trog: That's how much... That's how much I
love the Nintendo 64. I'm playing mashup ROM

0:29:54.130,0:29:55.130
hacks now.

0:29:55.130,0:29:56.130
Gir: How is that?

0:29:56.130,0:29:57.340
Wayne: Is it all of Ocarina of Time?

0:29:57.340,0:30:05.120
Trog: It is a significant amount! It is basically
every area except for like, the fire temple.

0:30:05.120,0:30:07.539
It's like, pretty much the whole game.

0:30:07.539,0:30:08.539
Gir: [Crosstalk] Well, who cares about the
fire temple.

0:30:08.539,0:30:09.539
Wayne: Why'd they skip the fire temple?

0:30:09.539,0:30:14.150
Trog: I dunno. I remember reading something
that the devs said, and they were like, somebody

0:30:14.150,0:30:19.511
asked like, "Oh, are you ever gonna go back
and add in the fire temple- the fire temple

0:30:19.511,0:30:24.210
and the shadow temple, because neither of
those two are in?" And the dude was like,

0:30:24.210,0:30:26.740
"I literally can't. There's no more room in
the ROM."

0:30:26.740,0:30:27.740
[Baaulp laughs]

0:30:27.740,0:30:29.539
Wayne: I was thinking it might be something
like that.

0:30:29.539,0:30:33.400
Trog: "I used up every last byte available
for this ROM hack."

0:30:33.400,0:30:37.880
Gir: You'd have to- you'd probably have to
have Banjo-Kazooie get fucking dumped. Get

0:30:37.880,0:30:39.180
their ROMs, like...

0:30:39.180,0:30:43.390
Trog: Something, yeah. But hey, that-that
ROM hack's really good. I think it's called

0:30:43.390,0:30:48.179
Banjo-Kazooie: The Jiggies of Time, so...
if you, if you like 3D platformers, that one's

0:30:48.179,0:30:49.340
pretty dang good.

0:30:49.340,0:30:53.710
Log: I wonder if it's like, we're fixing to
run out of eras to be nostalgic for, really.

0:30:53.710,0:30:55.440
Baaulp: That's what I was gonna say!

0:30:55.440,0:31:05.559
Log: 'Cause yeah, like, 16 bit, alright, uh,
Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1 era, like once

0:31:05.559,0:31:10.470
you get to the PlayStation 2, GameCube whatever,
that's not really charming anymore.

0:31:10.470,0:31:11.770
Trog: Yeah.

0:31:11.770,0:31:17.029
Baaulp: Yeah, the graphics are like, the graphics
start to be, just like, "hey, we're trying

0:31:17.029,0:31:22.919
to be realistic", and now things are very
realistic looking games. But now it's like,

0:31:22.919,0:31:29.260
are we, like what... Maybe I can foresee,
I can foresee us being nostalgic for that,

0:31:29.260,0:31:34.649
but what is gonna happen with video games
graphics in the next 20 years that is gonna

0:31:34.649,0:31:37.309
make us re- uh, nostalgic for that?

0:31:37.309,0:31:38.850
Wayne: It won't happen.

0:31:38.850,0:31:42.779
Gir: The nostalgia factor will be for the
games themselves, rather than like, the style

0:31:42.779,0:31:43.779
of the game.

0:31:43.779,0:31:44.779
Baaulp: I guess, yeah.

0:31:44.779,0:31:45.779
Trog: Yeah.

0:31:45.779,0:31:47.790
Log: People are gonna get nostalgic for just
like the weird ass shovelware on the PS2.

0:31:47.790,0:31:49.010
Gir: I mean, obviously!

0:31:49.010,0:31:50.010
[Baaulp laughs]

0:31:50.010,0:31:51.660
Wayne: I mean, yeah. I think that like-

0:31:51.660,0:31:52.660
Trog: Yeah!

0:31:52.660,0:31:55.700
Wayne: -there could be that kind of, like,
era, for like PS2 games, but it'll be like

0:31:55.700,0:31:57.210
the shit- shit ones.

0:31:57.210,0:32:03.080
Trog: Yeah, whenever you're talking about
nostalgia for certain, like, you're right

0:32:03.080,0:32:09.200
in that it's not like the PS2, GameCube era,
it is specific PS2 GameCube games. 'Cause

0:32:09.200,0:32:15.250
whenever I think of stuff like that, I think
of games with a very specific, uh, visual

0:32:15.250,0:32:18.299
style. Like, you have Katamari, you have Jet
Set Radio...

0:32:18.299,0:32:19.299
Gir: Yeah.

0:32:19.299,0:32:22.710
Trog: You have like, you have these games
that went for a specific feel...

0:32:22.710,0:32:23.850
Wayne: And that's already happening!

0:32:23.850,0:32:28.039
Trog: Exactly! And you already see games,
that- that try to do that same kind of feel.

0:32:28.039,0:32:32.620
Wayne: Tho-those sort of nostalgia trip games
are already happening like, you have-you have

0:32:32.620,0:32:36.590
Lethal League and their new title that looks
like—that is literally just a spiritual

0:32:36.590,0:32:40.830
successor to Jet Set Radio, with Hideki Naganuma
doing the whole fuckin’ soundtrack.

0:32:40.830,0:32:46.220
Baaulp: Dude, someone needs to make—'cause
EA won’t—someone needs to make SSX, dude.

0:32:46.220,0:32:47.220
Make SSX!

0:32:47.220,0:32:48.220
Trog: Yeah.

0:32:48.220,0:32:50.950
Wayne: Our friend Brandon is doing Monkey
Ball. Like, they’re-they’re making a new

0:32:50.950,0:32:51.950
Monkey Ball!

0:32:51.950,0:32:56.240
Log: Yeah, if somebody made just like a game
that was like SSX3, I would be so down.

0:32:56.240,0:32:57.240
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:32:57.240,0:32:58.240
Wayne: That would be dope!

0:32:58.240,0:33:00.929
Gir: Wind Waker’s my case in point, by the
way. Look at how many things imitated Wind

0:33:00.929,0:33:02.919
Waker, in style and gameplay.

0:33:02.919,0:33:03.919
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:33:03.919,0:33:09.899
Log: Hold on a second, ‘cause we talked
about Jet Set Radio. It’s like, I love Hideki

0:33:09.899,0:33:13.539
Naganuma, they need to have more than just
him for that soundtrack, though.

0:33:13.539,0:33:14.880
Baaulp: Oh, yeah, like—

0:33:14.880,0:33:18.180
Log: People-people don’t-people don’t
know that like, Baaulp’s been playing the

0:33:18.180,0:33:19.570
original Jet Set Radio—

0:33:19.570,0:33:20.570
Baaulp: Uh-huh.

0:33:20.570,0:33:23.520
Log: Uh, people don’t realize just like,
how many people are on those soundtracks,

0:33:23.520,0:33:24.520
like—

0:33:24.520,0:33:25.520
Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

0:33:25.520,0:33:28.350
Log: —Jet Set Radio, the original, has Rob
Zombie Dragula in it.

0:33:28.350,0:33:29.370
Trog: Does it really?

0:33:29.370,0:33:35.710
Baaulp: Yeah, it has a remix of Rob Zombie’s
Dragula, it has a track from Jurassic 5 on

0:33:35.710,0:33:41.080
it, and it has like, a l—it has a—like,
Hideki Namanuma-Naganuma worked on the soundtrack,

0:33:41.080,0:33:47.130
but he is not the entirety of it, like, there
was a lot of love put into that. And honestly,

0:33:47.130,0:33:55.110
hey, I’m not-I’m not worried though, because
like, okay get Hideki Naganuma, awesome, uh,

0:33:55.110,0:34:00.490
just get like a whole bunch of, like, where-look
at the day and age we live in like, I don’t

0:34:00.490,0:34:06.220
listen to anyone on the top fi—I don’t
listen to anyone who’s been on a Billboard

0:34:06.220,0:34:12.330
chart, like-like yeah, just get like whoever
like, get—does their music sound good? Fit

0:34:12.330,0:34:13.540
the bill? Nice.

0:34:13.540,0:34:18.130
Wayne: Whether he-whether they-that he literally
does the whole soundtrack or if he’s just

0:34:18.130,0:34:21.839
like, or if he does a bunch of it and there
are other artists, I’m excited either way

0:34:21.839,0:34:26.120
because like they got him for like, the Lethal
League 2 soundtrack, but he only had one song.

0:34:26.120,0:34:27.120
Baaulp: Right.

0:34:27.120,0:34:30.001
Wayne: And it’s an amazing song, but I was
like, “Damn, I want more.” Some of these-some

0:34:30.001,0:34:36.200
of the songs in that game were fucking awesome.
Klaus Veen made like, a ton of tracks that

0:34:36.200,0:34:41.280
I now have like, hundreds of plays on Spotify
at this point. Like Ordinary Days, Candyman’s

0:34:41.280,0:34:42.310
theme? That’s the shit.

0:34:42.310,0:34:44.760
Log: Yeah, Bring-bring on-bring on Klaus Veen.

0:34:44.760,0:34:47.050
Wayne: I hope they do.

0:34:47.050,0:34:49.950
Log: Uh, get my boy Nanoray on there.

0:34:49.950,0:34:54.290
Wayne: That would be fuckin’ awesome! Oh,
man. I wish I knew those devs, I would be

0:34:54.290,0:34:56.679
like, “Yo, look at this guy.”

0:34:56.679,0:35:01.589
Baaulp: Yeah, just get-just get people-just
get—Yeah. Just like-like, just fuckin’

0:35:01.589,0:35:07.380
make this like, let people have their shot.
This is a cool chance. That game is so fuckin’

0:35:07.380,0:35:09.000
hard, it has not aged well.

0:35:09.000,0:35:10.990
Wayne: No, I couldn’t get into it the one
time I tried to play

0:35:10.990,0:35:11.990
it.

0:35:11.990,0:35:16.940
Baaulp: The gameplay it is—you can definitely
tell it was a game released in 2001. The controls

0:35:16.940,0:35:19.410
are like, so stiff, it’s so hard to do everything.

0:35:19.410,0:35:21.570
Log: You really are on rollerskates.

0:35:21.570,0:35:22.570
Baaulp: Yeah!

0:35:22.570,0:35:23.570
[Trog laughs]

0:35:23.570,0:35:26.400
Wayne: You gotta play Future, I hear that
one is better. The—

0:35:26.400,0:35:28.410
Baaulp: That one’s also stranded.

0:35:28.410,0:35:30.150
Wayne: Future’s inaccessible, like—

0:35:30.150,0:35:37.530
Baaulp: Yeah. The other thing that like, uh,
I wasn’t expecting, is that game to-to have

0:35:37.530,0:35:44.060
stayed relevant, because the first-the first
thing thatthe game says is like, “We’re-we’re

0:35:44.060,0:35:49.400
street punks, and the police are after us,”
and the police are like, pulling no punches.

0:35:49.400,0:35:54.290
They are literally shooting at you, they are
literally throwing grenades at you, teargas

0:35:54.290,0:35:59.300
[laughs]. It’s like, oh, I didn’t expect
this game to be this rele-dysto—

0:35:59.300,0:36:00.300
Wayne: That way.

0:36:00.300,0:36:01.930
Baaulp: Yeah, to hit that way.

0:36:01.930,0:36:02.930
Wayne: It does.

0:36:02.930,0:36:03.930
[Trog laughs]

0:36:03.930,0:36:07.330
Baaulp: I like, [laughs] I thought it was
just a “Grrr, these kids are-are messing

0:36:07.330,0:36:12.280
around with graffiti, we gotta-I dunno, throw
like a cartoon net over them, I-like—

0:36:12.280,0:36:13.280
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:36:13.280,0:36:16.750
Baaulp: I didn’t-I didn’t, like, when
they’re like, “We’re gonna start—”

0:36:16.750,0:36:17.750
Wayne: Uh-oh.

0:36:17.750,0:36:21.780
Baaulp: Yeah, like, they like, especially
in the first few levels they’re like, “Ah,

0:36:21.780,0:36:27.630
start teargassing ‘em,” I’m like, woah.
[Laughs] What? So, yeah, it’s a, weirdly

0:36:27.630,0:36:29.490
relevant, on that front.

0:36:29.490,0:36:35.240
Wayne: Uh, one more game before we move onto
other topics. I would say the one that we-a

0:36:35.240,0:36:40.440
lot of here have touchin’ and lookin’
at has been Risk of Rain 2, the 1.0 update.

0:36:40.440,0:36:41.440
Trog: Oh, yeah.

0:36:41.440,0:36:48.780
Wayne: The end has finally come, uh, and I
have a lot of thoughts, I mostly think it’s

0:36:48.780,0:36:55.920
dope, um, the final boss has some problems,
but I think overall I’m happy with it. Trog,

0:36:55.920,0:36:57.150
how do you feel about that final boss?

0:36:57.150,0:37:04.430
Trog: I think that Risk of Rain 2, the 1.0
update—Risk of Rain 2 as an entire gameplay

0:37:04.430,0:37:09.829
experience is great, I would recommend it
to anybody who likes third-person action games

0:37:09.829,0:37:16.569
and rogue-lites, I think it’s kind of obvious
if you’ve been keeping up with the game

0:37:16.569,0:37:21.280
and you’re coming into the 1.0 update from
the last one, I think you can kind of see

0:37:21.280,0:37:26.890
that they were definitely trying to hit a
deadline. I think that what they have added

0:37:26.890,0:37:34.319
in the 1.0 update is a little rough around
the edges, but it’s not bad in any way.

0:37:34.319,0:37:36.950
The game itself is not bad, it’s definitely
worth playing, I’m still—

0:37:36.950,0:37:38.079
Wayne: The game is great!

0:37:38.079,0:37:40.160
Trog: The game is great, I’m still enjoying
it.

0:37:40.160,0:37:43.390
Wayne: One of my favorite games of the past
few-like, past year or two. It came out in

0:37:43.390,0:37:46.400
early access, I don’t know if it’s my
game of the year, but.

0:37:46.400,0:37:53.480
Trog: But, the 1.0 update stuff is-feels uh,
uh slightly half-baked. It’s just not as

0:37:53.480,0:37:58.099
big of an update as you would expect from
like, a 1.0 release.

0:37:58.099,0:38:05.369
Wayne: You know why I can like, be like, biased
and like kind of brown-nose the update a little

0:38:05.369,0:38:14.301
bit? Ah, single-handedly is the-the fucking
composer made a sequel to Coalescence, which

0:38:14.301,0:38:18.390
is like, one of my favorite tracks in any
video game. The final-the final area of Risk

0:38:18.390,0:38:23.690
of Rain 1 has like, the most amazing track,
and the-the song they use for the final area

0:38:23.690,0:38:28.930
of Risk of Rain 2 is pretty much just like
a-like a—it is a reinterpretation of that

0:38:28.930,0:38:32.271
same
song, same motif, with a new spin and it’s

0:38:32.271,0:38:36.900
just as good. It’s-I would say maybe not
as good, but very, very close, and it’s

0:38:36.900,0:38:41.079
fucking awesome. That final area is so cool
visually with that music.

0:38:41.079,0:38:44.790
Log: Yeah, I think that the music was the
only thing that met the bar, really.

0:38:44.790,0:38:45.790
Trog: Yeah.

0:38:45.790,0:38:50.839
Log: I thought-I thought the rest didn’t
really meet standards. The-the final level

0:38:50.839,0:38:54.650
in Risk of Rain 1, like in Providence and
stuff, were just much better.

0:38:54.650,0:39:00.440
Wayne: It is-in terms of gameplay, yeah. Much
cooler. Risk of Rain 2, that area looks really

0:39:00.440,0:39:05.329
cool, but all it is is you run on a bridge
for five minutes and then you fight the boss.

0:39:05.329,0:39:06.329
Trog: Yeah.

0:39:06.329,0:39:10.291
Wayne: The like—I don’t know I, for whatever
reason, if you-if you play Risk of—Risk

0:39:10.291,0:39:14.119
of Rain 1, you can’t loop in the same way
you can loop in Risk of Rain 2, unless you

0:39:14.119,0:39:15.510
can, am I mixed up on that?

0:39:15.510,0:39:16.510
Log: Yeah, you can loop.

0:39:16.510,0:39:20.000
Wayne: You can loop? Okay, so Risk of Rain
1, let’s say you play the game for a while

0:39:20.000,0:39:22.770
and then you loop and then you play the game
for a while, and then you up deciding to go

0:39:22.770,0:39:27.820
to the final level. The-that last level is
fuckin’ crazy, like with how many enemies

0:39:27.820,0:39:31.579
there are and the difficulty like, and the
amount of items it gives you like-it’s like

0:39:31.579,0:39:34.619
one final power spike for
you while the game throws everything it has

0:39:34.619,0:39:39.230
at you. If you loop in Risk of Rain 2, you
will play like you’re-you’ll be on like

0:39:39.230,0:39:42.301
level nine or whatever, and there will be
overloading worms all other the place and

0:39:42.301,0:39:47.170
it’ll be crazy and you’ll be like, about
to die at all times, then you go to the final

0:39:47.170,0:39:51.329
level and there’s four enemies. I don’t-I
don’t know why, but like—

0:39:51.329,0:39:52.329
Trog: Yeah, it’s kinda lame.

0:39:52.329,0:39:55.410
Wayne: —The enem-the enemies there are cool
and strong, but it’s just like, does-I-it’s

0:39:55.410,0:39:56.410
so—

0:39:56.410,0:39:57.410
Trog: It’s very empty.

0:39:57.410,0:40:00.099
Wayne: It’s so barren. Yeah, it’s completely
empty.

0:40:00.099,0:40:01.890
Trog: And I feel like that’s by design.

0:40:01.890,0:40:02.890
Wayne: Yeah.

0:40:02.890,0:40:06.970
Trog: Like, maybe not from-maybe not by design
from a gameplay standpoint, but from like

0:40:06.970,0:40:09.860
a, y’know, either a narrative or just like
an aesthetic—

0:40:09.860,0:40:11.089
Wayne: It’s a-I think it’s a lore thing.

0:40:11.089,0:40:18.000
Trog: Yeah, either lore or aesthetic, they
wanted that area to feel empty, but that doesn’t

0:40:18.000,0:40:20.740
translate into super good gameplay, is the
thing.

0:40:20.740,0:40:24.579
Wayne: The final bosses’ name is literally
The King of Nothing, so I imagine that’s

0:40:24.579,0:40:25.630
why the Moon is like that.

0:40:25.630,0:40:27.903
Trog: Yeah. It’s probably an aesthetic thing,
which I-I can [unintelligible].

0:40:27.903,0:40:30.230
Wayne: [Crosstalk] And I think-I think with
how good-with

0:40:30.230,0:40:36.080
how good the gameplay is outside of like the-its-its-its
shortcomings there, I think-I think it’s-I

0:40:36.080,0:40:39.520
think it’s okay that they leaned for the
aesthetic more than like, the actual final

0:40:39.520,0:40:40.520
level being—

0:40:40.520,0:40:43.609
Trog: Sure. Because the thing is that you
don’t really get

0:40:43.609,0:40:48.700
anything for beating the final boss… more
than once. You unlock a new character

0:40:48.700,0:40:52.080
when you beat it once and I think you should
get something for beating it on Monsoon.

0:40:52.080,0:40:54.200
Wayne: [Crosstalk] On each difficulty! You
get one of-you get one of the craziest blue

0:40:54.200,0:40:57.490
items if you beat it on Monsoon, I have yet
to do it. I’m excited to do it.

0:40:57.490,0:41:01.790
Trog: So, so it’s like you can honestly
kind of ignore that and play the game like

0:41:01.790,0:41:06.760
how you played it before the update, where
you’re just going for the longest run possible

0:41:06.760,0:41:08.891
which I think is more fun, I think it’s
more

0:41:08.891,0:41:13.440
fun to just see how far and how crazy of a
build you can get rather than just

0:41:13.440,0:41:14.990
going for the final boss or whatever.

0:41:14.990,0:41:19.380
Wayne: Yeah. But there are—Yeah, and-but-and
I-and I like that you can use the two together,

0:41:19.380,0:41:21.670
like you can go like super long and then when
it’s

0:41:21.670,0:41:25.040
like, “Okay, I’m starting to get bored,
let’s go see how-if I can take on the

0:41:25.040,0:41:27.859
final boss like this,” ‘cause the final
boss keeps getting stronger, too. Like

0:41:27.859,0:41:28.970
the longer that you keep playing.

0:41:28.970,0:41:29.970
Trog: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

0:41:29.970,0:41:31.790
Wayne: And that-when it comes to that fight—we
haven’t actually talked about the boss itself

0:41:31.790,0:41:37.340
that much—uh, that boss has some bullshit
in there, especially the first time that you

0:41:37.340,0:41:40.960
fight it—Hey, if you’re listening now,
and you haven’t played it yet, wh-when the

0:41:40.960,0:41:45.880
boss jumps you need to jump. You need to stay
in the air for like, at least like, ten seconds.

0:41:45.880,0:41:47.970
When he lands, you will die if you’re on
the ground.

0:41:47.970,0:41:48.970
Trog: Yeah.

0:41:48.970,0:41:51.521
Wayne: We’re telling you that now because
some of our friends were not told that and

0:41:51.521,0:41:54.760
they were very mad. In fact, Trog here had
that experience, um—

0:41:54.760,0:41:59.330
Trog: It’s just the kind of thing where
the final boss design seems a little incongruous

0:41:59.330,0:42:04.660
with the rest of the boss design and the enemy
design in the game, in that it feels like

0:42:04.660,0:42:11.040
they were making a Dark Souls boss for a game
where it takes you thirty minutes to get to

0:42:11.040,0:42:12.270
the final boss, right?

0:42:12.270,0:42:13.270
Wayne: Mhmm.

0:42:13.270,0:42:17.720
Trog: Like, it’s not like Dark Souls where
it’s like, alright, you can have your boss

0:42:17.720,0:42:22.990
have bullshit one-hit attacks in Dark Souls,
because you die and you’re at the bonfire

0:42:22.990,0:42:25.560
and you spend thirty seconds walking back
to the

0:42:25.560,0:42:29.380
boss fight and you just try it again. But
that doesn’t work in a rogue-like where

0:42:29.380,0:42:33.220
it’s like, alright, I’ve got a good build
for the first-like, I’ve done

0:42:33.220,0:42:36.690
ten runs, this if the first run in ten runs
where I have a good build, I’m

0:42:36.690,0:42:40.869
gonna go, I’m gonna do the boss—It just
did something that I have no idea it

0:42:40.869,0:42:44.349
could have done, and I’m dead. And now my
run is over.

0:42:44.349,0:42:47.500
Wayne: Other-other rogue-lites like, when
you—the-the-the-the

0:42:47.500,0:42:51.069
thing is is like, some-some other games it
takes just as long to get to the final boss,

0:42:51.069,0:42:54.300
like the-the Dead Cell’s final boss you
have to play the game for a long time to get

0:42:54.300,0:42:57.210
there, and that boss is hard as fuck, I’ve
never beaten it.

0:42:57.210,0:42:58.210
Trog: [Crosstalk] That is true.

0:42:58.210,0:43:01.849
Wayne: Um, the uh, like I think-I think the
amount of time that you have to go there,

0:43:01.849,0:43:07.230
in my opinion, is-can be both infuriating,
but I think the fact that so much like-so

0:43:07.230,0:43:12.290
much of your time and effort weighs on
like, how you manage to fair I think is like,

0:43:12.290,0:43:15.850
it’s fitting to me, and it-it
makes it cool. Like, the-the time where I

0:43:15.850,0:43:20.320
actually did it, like the-the one time I beat
the final boss—like, I cheesed it a little

0:43:20.320,0:43:23.200
bit at the beginning, but when you get to
the very final stage—spoilers, if you don’t

0:43:23.200,0:43:26.780
want me spoiling the boss—the very final
stage of the boss is he takes away all of

0:43:26.780,0:43:30.970
your items and you have to fight him raw while
you progress and try to get your items back.

0:43:30.970,0:43:34.540
And I was like, I had like a kind of weak
build, I was jumping around, I was hitting

0:43:34.540,0:43:37.590
him with lightning whenever I could, and when
I got to that phase I was like, “Fuck, it’s

0:43:37.590,0:43:41.150
on.” And I jumped up and got in front of
his face and just fuckin’ like, APM’d

0:43:41.150,0:43:46.200
the shit out of him with Mercenary and I managed
to kill him, like, while he was giving me

0:43:46.200,0:43:50.150
my items back, like, before he took everything
or whatever, and it felt so good to finally

0:43:50.150,0:43:51.150
get it done.

0:43:51.150,0:43:54.960
Trog: I think that final phase is honestly
one of the things I really don’t like about

0:43:54.960,0:43:59.190
it, because every time I’ve gotten-every
time I’ve attempted the final boss and gotten

0:43:59.190,0:44:04.609
to that final phase and I didn’t have some
sort of cheese strategy, or I wasn’t playing

0:44:04.609,0:44:09.270
a character that has a mobility skill, you
just get hosed, man. Like, I tried doing it—

0:44:09.270,0:44:10.829
Wayne: Certain characters can’t do it.

0:44:10.829,0:44:16.150
Trog: Yeah, I tried doing it as REX and it’s
like, I am too sl—like, he takes every single

0:44:16.150,0:44:17.150
one of your items, right?

0:44:17.150,0:44:18.150
Wayne: Yeah.

0:44:18.150,0:44:23.190
Trog: REX is a character that has no-or limited
mobility. Like, and slow to begin with.

0:44:23.190,0:44:25.270
Wanye: [Crosstalk] I almost did it as REX.

0:44:25.270,0:44:30.290
Trog: So it’s like, I can’t dodge the
attacks and then I just die. And it’s like,

0:44:30.290,0:44:34.710
the devs even said like, people were talking
about how the third phase was bullshit, and

0:44:34.710,0:44:39.839
the devs even came out in like a blogpost
and said like, “Yeah, the third phase wasn’t

0:44:39.839,0:44:43.410
supposed to be the hard part of that fight,
the third phase was just supposed to be kind

0:44:43.410,0:44:47.589
of like uh, ‘oh shit’ moment the first
time it happens, but it wasn’t supposed

0:44:47.589,0:44:53.160
to be like what you…
like gear up for,” so I think they will

0:44:53.160,0:44:54.760
probably end up tweaking that.

0:44:54.760,0:44:57.470
Log: Yeah, a lot of it just didn’t seem
very thought out.

0:44:57.470,0:45:03.010
Like the-the-the death island that you could
go to and softlock your game.

0:45:03.010,0:45:05.569
Trog: Yeah, there was a-there was an island
where you just

0:45:05.569,0:45:06.569
softlock.

0:45:06.569,0:45:08.250
Wayne: There’s just an island where if you
go on it, at

0:45:08.250,0:45:11.470
least in like the-before they patched it,
I still don’t know if they have. If

0:45:11.470,0:45:14.980
you didn’t have enough mobility skills,
you would just get stuck, and it happened

0:45:14.980,0:45:21.010
to me and Erarg when we were playing once,
and like, I-we literally like—I had

0:45:21.010,0:45:23.860
mobility, he didn’t, so he was just stuck
over there and I watched him struggle

0:45:23.860,0:45:26.770
and I was like, “Okay, we’re gonna find
out how the fuck to get you out of this,”

0:45:26.770,0:45:30.319
because if you’re in multiplayer, you can’t
spawn the final boss until everyone’s

0:45:30.319,0:45:33.130
there, and he had no way to suicide because
when you jump off the ledge it only

0:45:33.130,0:45:37.390
brings you down to one health. So what we
did was I had him like, jump, and

0:45:37.390,0:45:41.380
then I walked under him—No, I had-I had
him jump on top of me because you have

0:45:41.380,0:45:44.960
like a physical hitbox for other players,
and then I had him jump and then I

0:45:44.960,0:45:50.079
double-jumped, and hitting him restored his
jumps, so like, I boosted him off

0:45:50.079,0:45:54.339
my head to the final boss and it took us like
ten minutes to get it right. It

0:45:54.339,0:45:55.339
was-it was bullshit.

0:45:55.339,0:45:58.380
Log: Had to enact troll physics to play the
game [laughs].

0:45:58.380,0:46:02.420
Trog: Yeah. There’s just-I think—yeah.
Like I said at the

0:46:02.420,0:46:05.559
beginning of the conversation, I think it’s
obvious they were trying to hit a

0:46:05.559,0:46:09.540
deadline, they were set on that deadline—and
I respect them for sticking to the

0:46:09.540,0:46:13.680
deadline, but I feel like this is a situation
where maybe they could’ve said like,

0:46:13.680,0:46:18.030
“Hey guys, I know we had we had this date,”
and who knows, maybe it was out of their

0:46:18.030,0:46:21.000
control, I don’t know who their publisher
is it could be that they had to release

0:46:21.000,0:46:22.000
it—

0:46:22.000,0:46:23.000
Log: Gearbox.

0:46:23.000,0:46:24.329
Trog: Yeah, so maybe it was like, maybe the
date was totally

0:46:24.329,0:46:27.321
out of their hands, but I feel like this would
have been a situation where it

0:46:27.321,0:46:32.020
would have been okay to be like, “Hey guys,
we need like, another month. Like,

0:46:32.020,0:46:36.050
trust us, it’ll be good, but we just need
one more month and then we’ll release

0:46:36.050,0:46:40.570
it.” And I feel like that-that’ll be good.
Again, not that I dislike the game

0:46:40.570,0:46:44.530
in any way, I think that it’s great, I would
highly recommend it, but just-if

0:46:44.530,0:46:47.890
you’ve been keeping up with the game, the
1.0 update is a little half-baked.

0:46:47.890,0:46:53.099
Wayne: Now that Risk of R-chat-Rain is over,
Gir, what have

0:46:53.099,0:46:54.099
you been playing?

0:46:54.099,0:46:55.099
Gir: Fuck all.

0:46:55.099,0:46:56.099
Trog: Alright.

0:46:56.099,0:46:57.250
Wayne: Really, video games aren’t doing
it for you these days?

0:46:57.250,0:47:00.309
Gir: If it’s not been on stream, I’ve
not really played anything.

0:47:00.309,0:47:02.290
I’ve done hardly anything off stream lately.

0:47:02.290,0:47:03.290
Wayne: Hmm.

0:47:03.290,0:47:05.400
Gir: I think the only thing in the last few
days I’ve played

0:47:05.400,0:47:09.590
is literally because it came out like last
night, was Flight Simulator.

0:47:09.590,0:47:12.660
Wayne: Yeah, have you-how much of that did
you touch?

0:47:12.660,0:47:15.921
Gir: Uh… enough to know that I really should
just have a

0:47:15.921,0:47:16.921
flight stick.

0:47:16.921,0:47:18.869
Wayne: Is it-is it cool, though? Like, the—

0:47:18.869,0:47:20.230
Gir: Yeah, I mean it’s cool.

0:47:20.230,0:47:22.329
Wayne: Does it not play well with the Xbox
controller?

0:47:22.329,0:47:25.480
Gir: Eh, it doesn’t play well with my Xbox
controller.

0:47:25.480,0:47:27.040
Wayne: Oh. What’s wrong with yours?

0:47:27.040,0:47:32.180
Gir: My stick is like, o—it’s like, really
fucked up oversensitive stick.

0:47:32.180,0:47:33.180
Wayne: Mhmm.

0:47:33.180,0:47:36.420
Gir: Uh, it’s got uh, drift on it and everything.
And you don’t want drift when you’re trying

0:47:36.420,0:47:38.170
to keep a fucking plane straight.

0:47:38.170,0:47:39.170
Wayne: Yeah.

0:47:39.170,0:47:43.190
Gir: So, yeah, I think if I get into that
game more I’ll have to like, invest in a

0:47:43.190,0:47:44.430
flight stick of some kind.

0:47:44.430,0:47:48.790
Wayne: I uh, saw some funny shit from that
game already. And

0:47:48.790,0:47:52.309
like, the concept is super interesting with
like, them having the whole world

0:47:52.309,0:47:55.619
mapped out with satellite data, you can go
anywhere, like that’s pretty-it’s-you

0:47:55.619,0:47:56.619
see that—

0:47:56.619,0:47:57.880
Trog: I can go to my house?

0:47:57.880,0:48:00.050
Wayne: You see that country? You can fly to
it.

0:48:00.050,0:48:02.420
Gir: I did take the time to fly over my house.

0:48:02.420,0:48:04.270
Wayne: You can! You can go to your house!

0:48:04.270,0:48:05.270
Gir: Yeah.

0:48:05.270,0:48:06.950
Wayne: Someone found Grover House, like that’s-you
can—

0:48:06.950,0:48:07.950
[Gir laughs]

0:48:07.950,0:48:09.690
Baaulp, laughing: Holy shit! Holy shit!

0:48:09.690,0:48:11.890
Wayne: Yeah, you can go to Grover House, you
can-there—I saw

0:48:11.890,0:48:16.160
on Tumblr a post that was like, the game is
multiplayer, and it-it’s like—Gir,

0:48:16.160,0:48:19.610
is it like server based or is it just like
you see other people playing

0:48:19.610,0:48:22.020
the game, it’s like just a wide—like Sea
of Thieves.

0:48:22.020,0:48:24.200
Gir: It’s like a shard-based type deal.

0:48:24.200,0:48:26.290
Wayne: Yeah! So it’s like-it’s like Sea
of Thieves.

0:48:26.290,0:48:27.290
Gir: Yeah.

0:48:27.290,0:48:29.599
Wayne: Like-that’s-that’s fuckin’ dope.
The post that I saw

0:48:29.599,0:48:34.980
was like-like a bunch of planes landed on
an island and the caption was like, “Yeah,

0:48:34.980,0:48:38.640
everyone is just flying to Epstein’s island.
We’re gonna solve this ourselves.”

0:48:38.640,0:48:39.640
[Baaulp laughs]

0:48:39.640,0:48:43.130
Wayne: There were like eight biplanes landed
on Epstein’s island.

0:48:43.130,0:48:45.720
Yeah, I might have to check it out even though
I’m not usually into those kind

0:48:45.720,0:48:47.760
of games, especially because it’ll get VR
support soon.

0:48:47.760,0:48:51.170
Baaulp: It seems like, with that in that context
like, “Oh

0:48:51.170,0:48:53.730
yeah, we have the entire world mapped out,”
it seems like really dope to just

0:48:53.730,0:48:54.730
explore.

0:48:54.730,0:48:55.730
Gir: Yeah.

0:48:55.730,0:48:57.950
Baaulp: I would love to just-to just like-yeah,
find my own

0:48:57.950,0:49:00.402
house and just like, go around and uh—

0:49:00.402,0:49:07.070
Gir: The thing to remember though is it is—everything
is to scale. So, if you want to get somewhere

0:49:07.070,0:49:12.359
that would take two hours to fly to, it is
going to take two hours to fly there.

0:49:12.359,0:49:13.359
Trog: That’s pretty wild.

0:49:13.359,0:49:14.960
Baaulp: But-but like-but like, who cares.
Yeah, who cares.

0:49:14.960,0:49:15.960
Like, fuck it.

0:49:15.960,0:49:18.050
Gir: Hell, I mean if that’s what you want
to do, then you do

0:49:18.050,0:49:19.050
that, by all means.

0:49:19.050,0:49:21.319
Wayne: Can I play like, super mode. Can I
play hyper mode

0:49:21.319,0:49:23.970
where I fly like, a jet rocket and I [laughs].

0:49:23.970,0:49:25.190
Gir: I mean, there is a jet.

0:49:25.190,0:49:27.890
Baaulp: You can like-you can get out of your
plane too, is

0:49:27.890,0:49:28.890
that correct?

0:49:28.890,0:49:29.890
Gir: No.

0:49:29.890,0:49:32.280
Trog: You can’t jump out of your plane while
it’s moving?

0:49:32.280,0:49:34.590
Log: It’s like-it’s like Tony Hawk’s
Underground.

0:49:34.590,0:49:36.943
Wayne: That’s a-that’s a shame, there’s
no like-there’s no like

0:49:36.943,0:49:40.420
Test Drive Unlimited 2 element, like that
would be pretty cool.

0:49:40.420,0:49:42.589
Baaulp: If that was available y’know what
I’d do, I’d just

0:49:42.589,0:49:46.309
like-I’d just like fly over my own house
and jump out and like, land on my own

0:49:46.309,0:49:47.309
house [laughs].

0:49:47.309,0:49:48.309
[Wayne laughs]

0:49:48.309,0:49:50.290
Log: They added in a feature where if you
crash your plane

0:49:50.290,0:49:54.000
your pilot can get out, and if you mash a
button fast enough it raises his rage

0:49:54.000,0:49:56.500
meter and he can do a sick trick to destroy
his plane.

0:49:56.500,0:50:00.100
Wayne: [Laughs] He breaks the plane in half.
He steps on the

0:50:00.100,0:50:01.930
plane and smashes it to pieces.

0:50:01.930,0:50:05.520
Gir: I will say they-they have some like,
they have a lot of

0:50:05.520,0:50:09.940
like variety in the like how-how easy do you
want this to be. Do you want this

0:50:09.940,0:50:14.240
to be an arcade game or do you want this to
be a straight fucking simulator. So

0:50:14.240,0:50:17.800
you can turn off all of the like—you can
fly straight into the ground if you

0:50:17.800,0:50:20.470
want, you can fuckin’ do backflips all day
long—

0:50:20.470,0:50:24.190
Wayne: Can you like, is there cool destruction
if you have like-like

0:50:24.190,0:50:27.170
all the rules on, if you fly into the ground
do you get like fuckin’

0:50:27.170,0:50:28.170
obliterated?

0:50:28.170,0:50:32.290
Gir: If you fly too sharply, the game just
says, “Hey, you

0:50:32.290,0:50:36.140
flew so hard that you would have ripped the
wings off of a real plane. Therefore,

0:50:36.140,0:50:37.140
it is over. Restart.

0:50:37.140,0:50:38.140
[Trog laughs]

0:50:38.140,0:50:39.140
Wayne: Aw, you don’t get any animation?
That-that’s—aw, come

0:50:39.140,0:50:40.140
on.

0:50:40.140,0:50:43.340
Gir: You don’t get any animation—It just
cuts to black, you

0:50:43.340,0:50:45.030
hear like a-like a VRRRrrrrr, like a—

0:50:45.030,0:50:48.100
Wayne: You have to watch like a PSA about
why you shouldn’t

0:50:48.100,0:50:49.100
fly like that.

0:50:49.100,0:50:50.100
[Gir and Log laugh]

0:50:50.100,0:50:53.849
Wayne: You fucked up. All your passengers
are dead. Yeah, I’ll

0:50:53.849,0:50:56.250
have to-I’ll have to look into that. But
yeah, uh, another thing I wanted to

0:50:56.250,0:50:58.970
talk about, like, based on something you said,
you said like, “Yeah, you haven’t

0:50:58.970,0:51:03.930
been playing a whole lot of games off stream
lately,” uh, since May, which was

0:51:03.930,0:51:10.520
when our last podcast was, uh, our Twitch
Team, Radio TV Solutions, has really kicked

0:51:10.520,0:51:14.040
into gear. I think around that time was probably
when we actually formed it,

0:51:14.040,0:51:16.260
right? Like it would have been around May.
Around-around the time—

0:51:16.260,0:51:17.260
Baaulp: Yeah, yeah.

0:51:17.260,0:51:18.260
Trog: Uhh…

0:51:18.260,0:51:19.260
Gir: June.

0:51:19.260,0:51:20.260
Trog: June, yeah.

0:51:20.260,0:51:22.369
Wayne: May-man-June, so yeah. Like, all of
us stream now,

0:51:22.369,0:51:28.069
uh, some of us more than others. Uh, and it
has been a lot of fun, it’s been-I

0:51:28.069,0:51:32.720
feel like we’ve all been having a good chunk
of success, it’s been a good time.

0:51:32.720,0:51:37.020
Uh, the—one thing I want to talk about here
a little bit, is like, Gir I feel

0:51:37.020,0:51:40.460
like you in particular, like you’ve been
doing like, a ton of streaming. Like,

0:51:40.460,0:51:41.460
and you said that—

0:51:41.460,0:51:42.460
Gir: Oh, yeah.

0:51:42.460,0:51:43.559
Wayne: You-you-you said that-you said that
you haven’t been

0:51:43.559,0:51:48.980
playing a whole lot off stream because you’ve
been doing so much on stream. The—how

0:51:48.980,0:51:55.690
do you like, at-at-at—Do you ever see that
becoming a problem? Like-like, in

0:51:55.690,0:52:00.380
the way of like, some streamers that I know
who stream all the fuckin’ time

0:52:00.380,0:52:04.500
talk about how like video games are like shot
for them because of streaming. Like,

0:52:04.500,0:52:07.740
if they’re not-if they’re playing a game
off stream they can’t help but hear

0:52:07.740,0:52:10.810
that nagging voice in their head like, “I
should be streaming this.” And it

0:52:10.810,0:52:12.630
makes them-it makes the games hard to enjoy.

0:52:12.630,0:52:13.630
Gir: Yeah, uh—

0:52:13.630,0:52:15.010
Wayne: Are you-are any of you-I’ll talk
to all of you guys

0:52:15.010,0:52:16.010
here—

0:52:16.010,0:52:18.700
Gir: I’ve already started feeling that,
to an extent. Like, I

0:52:18.700,0:52:22.110
will-I will get a game and it’s like, “Oh,
this is gonna be a fun game, I

0:52:22.110,0:52:23.369
should probably stream this, though—”

0:52:23.369,0:52:26.349
Wayne: And then like if you-and then like-for-for
me, this

0:52:26.349,0:52:31.000
might be the same for you, Gir, is like, I
get that thought, and it doesn’t necessarily

0:52:31.000,0:52:35.059
make the game not fun for me, but it makes
it more stressful, I’m like, “Damn,

0:52:35.059,0:52:38.460
I could be, there could be so many ‘haha
funny’ moments if I were playing this

0:52:38.460,0:52:41.829
on stream. This could be such a good entertaining
game for the folks,” and I

0:52:41.829,0:52:45.770
just have that stress of like, and I misusing
my time, here? So far, hasn’t

0:52:45.770,0:52:48.260
ruined it for me. Baaulp, what were you saying?

0:52:48.260,0:52:52.540
Baaulp: I-I am privy to that. I try to avoid
it, and the way I avoid it is that I kind

0:52:52.540,0:52:58.490
of like, I kind of in my mind, at the-at the
risk of sounding egotistic, in my mind I like,

0:52:58.490,0:53:05.680
I tell myself that I’m the show. Not the
games, I am. So whatever game I play is whatever

0:53:05.680,0:53:12.150
people will want to watch, and that’s-that—I’ve
been able-for example, there’s been no-I’ve

0:53:12.150,0:53:16.740
like, there are some games that I keep to
myself, not be-not because I’m like, “Ooh,

0:53:16.740,0:53:21.080
this is my game and the audience doesn’t
get to see this,” but like, “Oh, no one’s

0:53:21.080,0:53:24.690
gonna wanna watch me play Magic the Gathering.”
Like, that’s not, y’know what I mean?

0:53:24.690,0:53:27.540
Wayne: I feel like I can do both reasons.
Like I have some games

0:53:27.540,0:53:32.190
where I-I don’t stream it because like,
I don’t think this would make for an

0:53:32.190,0:53:35.680
entertaining stream, like Risk of Rain 2,
for instance. I streamed it when it

0:53:35.680,0:53:40.220
launched because that was like an event, but
other than that, that game doesn’t—like

0:53:40.220,0:53:43.430
nobody really—like it’s kind of just us
y’know, going at it, doing the grind.

0:53:43.430,0:53:44.430
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:53:44.430,0:53:45.880
Wayne: There’s not anything like to talk
about, there’s nothing

0:53:45.880,0:53:46.880
special there.

0:53:46.880,0:53:49.700
Baaulp: Yeah like ga—like yeah. And then
like, uh, for

0:53:49.700,0:53:55.200
example, I’ll stream Tekken all the time,
and I’ll play it myself and like, the

0:53:55.200,0:53:57.930
enjoyment with that has not changed at all.

0:53:57.930,0:54:02.140
Gir: For me it’s more a matter of if I’m
playing something

0:54:02.140,0:54:07.089
off stream, and something really fucking funny
happens, I just feel that hint

0:54:07.089,0:54:10.359
of regret that I had no clue of it ever happening.

0:54:10.359,0:54:12.160
Wayne: Yeah, I’ve had that happen, too.
Sometimes-sometimes that also—that’ll

0:54:12.160,0:54:15.400
happen in a game-like I’ve had some crazy
shit happen in Fall Guys where it’s like,

0:54:15.400,0:54:19.849
“I fucking wish I was recording that,”
like that doesn’t make any sense. Then also,

0:54:19.849,0:54:23.609
that’ll happen even when we’re not playing
games. Like there’ll just be a really funny

0:54:23.609,0:54:28.119
conversation and like, I’m like, “Damn,
that would have been good if we were recording

0:54:28.119,0:54:30.400
this somehow. Like that would have been a
good moment to preserve.”

0:54:30.400,0:54:35.320
Baaulp: I-I don’t think it’s healthy to
have that want—Like for me, in my mind,

0:54:35.320,0:54:40.210
I guess that’s because I like come from
like, I guess I’m more professional like—every

0:54:40.210,0:54:45.250
job I’ve had before this has been like very
professional. And like, clear separation of

0:54:45.250,0:54:51.420
like, “Hey, maybe there’s some overlap
here, but this is my time versus work time.”

0:54:51.420,0:54:55.480
Wayne: Oh, yeah. And I mean, I have that too,
but because-the nature-the nature of this

0:54:55.480,0:55:01.930
job, the nature of what we do just means that
there is like, like you can try to make sure

0:55:01.930,0:55:06.710
that there’s little overlap, but like there-there
just is overlap. One of my biggest hobbies

0:55:06.710,0:55:11.820
is video games, that is also my job. That
overlap is just inherent. I was gonna—

0:55:11.820,0:55:13.190
Trog: [Crosstalk] I um, I don’t stream—Oh,
sorry.

0:55:13.190,0:55:17.140
Wayne: I was going to ask you the question
next. I feel like your approach, Trog, in

0:55:17.140,0:55:19.020
streaming on this team has been different
from

0:55:19.020,0:55:21.310
everybody else’s. When playing games, at
least.

0:55:21.310,0:55:24.599
Trog: Yeah, I don’t know. I don’t plan
on streaming as like a

0:55:24.599,0:55:26.090
source of income, I—

0:55:26.090,0:55:27.180
Wayne: You’re the producer.

0:55:27.180,0:55:31.369
Trog: The way that I have been tackling Twitch
is like, do I

0:55:31.369,0:55:36.200
think this will be entertaining for people?
If so, I’ll stream it. Or if, y’know

0:55:36.200,0:55:41.349
sometimes, I feel like the thing with um,
the turning point for a Twitch stream

0:55:41.349,0:55:45.770
is when you have enough people in your chat
that you can keep up a conversation

0:55:45.770,0:55:53.550
with them. ‘Cause we-we do a lot of Twitch
viewing of literal zero viewer Twitch

0:55:53.550,0:55:58.910
streams and it’s like, if you are streaming
to an audience of zero, you are

0:55:58.910,0:56:00.829
simply playing a video game, right?

0:56:00.829,0:56:01.829
Wayne: Mhmm.

0:56:01.829,0:56:03.061
Trog: You’re not really doing anything,
I feel like the

0:56:03.061,0:56:08.480
turning point is whenever you can get enough
viewers that there’s somebody, y’know

0:56:08.480,0:56:11.349
like a handful of people that will talk in
the chat and you can have some sort

0:56:11.349,0:56:19.359
of dialogue with them. And I feel like we
are all at that level now, but for me

0:56:19.359,0:56:24.539
I’m not doing it as a source of income,
so I’m basically just selling my emotes

0:56:24.539,0:56:26.630
to people, is how I kind of tackle it.

0:56:26.630,0:56:27.630
Wayne: [Laughs] That’s fun.

0:56:27.630,0:56:30.450
Trog: It’s like, look, I am an affiliate,
therefore I have

0:56:30.450,0:56:35.940
emotes, I want emotes so that I can use them,
so if you want, you can buy these

0:56:35.940,0:56:37.619
emotes from me for five dollars.

0:56:37.619,0:56:40.630
Wayne: When you play your games, there’s
like, you-like, I

0:56:40.630,0:56:45.099
notice when like, watching your streams, you
are very much more showcasing

0:56:45.099,0:56:49.200
like, sharing the game that you’re playing
and sharing the experience and like-like-like

0:56:49.200,0:56:52.359
alongside the chat and like, you will go long
stretches of silence like just

0:56:52.359,0:56:54.079
focusing on the game, right? Like—

0:56:54.079,0:56:57.059
Trog: Sure. So, for instance I streamed Anodyne
2 and I

0:56:57.059,0:57:00.760
like, basically just didn’t talk for any
of that just because like what-what do

0:57:00.760,0:57:06.089
you say? Like, I-the thing that I’m self-conscious
about with streaming is that

0:57:06.089,0:57:12.680
I-I don’t want to fall into that like generic
streamer mode where it’s just like,

0:57:12.680,0:57:18.750
y’know, y’know what the jokes are where
it’s like, “Oh, look at the character!

0:57:18.750,0:57:20.880
Look
at it go! Oh, it’s crazy, they performed

0:57:20.880,0:57:23.920
a jump! Oh man, this is cra-oh,
you-you-can you guys see this? Oh, this is

0:57:23.920,0:57:27.560
crazy.” And there’s just like,
fucking nothing going on stream and it’s

0:57:27.560,0:57:30.270
like, “This dude is a psychopath, he’s
just-he’s just saying anything!”

0:57:30.270,0:57:31.270
[Baaulp laughs]

0:57:31.270,0:57:33.609
Gir: You gotta learn to be comfortable with
silence every now

0:57:33.609,0:57:34.609
and then.

0:57:34.609,0:57:37.270
Wayne: My streams like, my streams have like-like
I try-I

0:57:37.270,0:57:41.740
try to-I try to evoke a higher energy, like,
I like chaos. I like intense moments

0:57:41.740,0:57:46.430
and shit like that, but like, the-when it
comes-when nothing’s happening like,

0:57:46.430,0:57:51.119
I’ll still try to talk but like, I’m not
gonna-I’m not—that’s like-I feel like

0:57:51.119,0:57:53.620
what you just described is like, Markiplier
syndrome.

0:57:53.620,0:57:55.280
Gir, laughing: It’s a syndrome.

0:57:55.280,0:57:58.630
Trog: I-what I just did does not describe
anybody on our Twitch

0:57:58.630,0:57:59.829
Team, just for the record.

0:57:59.829,0:58:00.829
Wayne: Yeah.

0:58:00.829,0:58:01.829
Gir: Markiplier disorder.

0:58:01.829,0:58:03.799
Trog: That’s like-that is describing a human
that none of us

0:58:03.799,0:58:04.799
are. Like—

0:58:04.799,0:58:05.799
Wayne: Yeah [laughs].

0:58:05.799,0:58:08.790
Trog: That is like, a specific breed of like—and
I just feel

0:58:08.790,0:58:13.790
like, for me it’s like, yeah, y’know,
I want to let the game talk for itself. And

0:58:13.790,0:58:19.810
I’ll-I’ll like say out loud what my thought
process is if I’m like, y’know, for

0:58:19.810,0:58:24.630
instance, okay, I’m playing the Banjo-Kazooie
ROM hack or whatever, I’m like

0:58:24.630,0:58:28.180
thinking out loud like, “Alright I need
to get-I’m gonna go grab these notes, I

0:58:28.180,0:58:32.589
saw some stuff over there,” but I’m not
like commenting on every single thing

0:58:32.589,0:58:37.069
that the character is doing, and I don’t
know. That just-that works for me.

0:58:37.069,0:58:38.589
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Mhmm. Everybody got their
own approach.

0:58:38.589,0:58:42.020
Trog: I think people-I want people to enjoy
the more laidback

0:58:42.020,0:58:46.190
attitude and I think I-I think I can bring
that to the group, at least.

0:58:46.190,0:58:50.020
Wayne: Oh, yeah. For sure. I—If I get one
piece of criticism

0:58:50.020,0:58:54.500
that like, I-my stream’s—it’s definitely
valid, and like, a lot of like, the

0:58:54.500,0:58:57.099
different members of the team, you could avoid
that by watching their stream

0:58:57.099,0:59:00.089
instead of mine, people are like, “Yeah,
when I watch Wayne’s streams I get

0:59:00.089,0:59:02.119
overstimulated and it like, hurts my head.”

0:59:02.119,0:59:03.119
[Baaulp laughs]

0:59:03.119,0:59:04.119
Trog: Yeah.

0:59:04.119,0:59:06.510
Wayne: ‘Cause like a lot of the times, depending
on what the stream is and what we’re doing,

0:59:06.510,0:59:10.990
it can be that way. The—and it’s like,
sometimes it’s a good thing, sometimes it’s

0:59:10.990,0:59:14.579
the best thing, and I love it. And other times
it’s wholly like, unintentional, like I’m

0:59:14.579,0:59:18.600
just trying to like manage the amount of alerts
like, with the music, with the game, with

0:59:18.600,0:59:19.610
the-with our dialogue.

0:59:19.610,0:59:23.990
Log: You mean people don’t wanna see a combination
Destiny 2 Runescape stream?

0:59:23.990,0:59:24.990
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:59:24.990,0:59:28.650
Wayne: I need to do another one of those.
The—I, yeah. Like

0:59:28.650,0:59:32.550
those-those are the times yes, those are the
times where I’m trying to overstimulate

0:59:32.550,0:59:37.750
you, I’m trying to make your head explode
through Twitch. The uh, but yeah-but I’m-I’m-I’m

0:59:37.750,0:59:42.320
getting better at like, finding a sort of
like, a median where like, okay, alerts are

0:59:42.320,0:59:47.460
not going to like literally make it impossible
for you to focus on like the dialogue, like

0:59:47.460,0:59:51.289
certain streams I just have to forego like,
maybe get a little bit less income but like,

0:59:51.289,0:59:52.369
the show can be better.

0:59:52.369,0:59:54.860
Gir: Yeah, I will say I personally-I tried—

0:59:54.860,0:59:56.099
Wayne: You just turned off TTS.

0:59:56.099,1:00:01.030
Gir: I tried the text-to-speech thing for
like, I dunno, like three or four weeks, and

1:00:01.030,1:00:05.950
I was like, I can already see this snowballing
to the point where I just can’t pay attention

1:00:05.950,1:00:09.450
anymore. Like forget anyone else watching,
I wasn’t able to pay attention, so.

1:00:09.450,1:00:14.740
Wayne: In my chat, when it works right, like,
it is a great way for me to have discussions

1:00:14.740,1:00:19.500
better. Like just because the size of the
chat is so big that I can have those dialogues

1:00:19.500,1:00:23.200
that like, you were talking about, but the
problem is that it’s splintered. If I’m

1:00:23.200,1:00:28.069
having a conversation with chat it is usually
not the same person, but rather the chat talking

1:00:28.069,1:00:29.069
to me collectively.

1:00:29.069,1:00:31.829
Trog: Yeah. Exactly. But that’s what happens
when you have like,

1:00:31.829,1:00:35.000
a viewership that is an order of magnitude
bigger than like—

1:00:35.000,1:00:36.849
Wayne: Yeah, yeah. It’s just inherent.

1:00:36.849,1:00:40.250
Trog: You have your zero view streams, you
have your like,

1:00:40.250,1:00:44.030
tier one—like you two years ago, like twenty
to fifty people.

1:00:44.030,1:00:45.030
Wayne: Yeah.

1:00:45.030,1:00:47.850
Trog: Then you have like tier two, fifty to
like, I would

1:00:47.850,1:00:52.700
say even up to like three or four hundred
people. A chat is pretty much the

1:00:52.700,1:00:55.210
same from like, fifty to four hundred people,
in my opinion.

1:00:55.210,1:00:56.210
Wayne: Mhmm.

1:00:56.210,1:00:58.750
Trog: But then like, you reach like, that
four-digit number

1:00:58.750,1:01:02.869
and it’s just like, the chat is unreadable
at that point.

1:01:02.869,1:01:05.859
Wayne: Then you enter Twitch jungle. That’s-that’s
video

1:01:05.859,1:01:06.859
jungle.

1:01:06.859,1:01:08.210
Gir: Chat’s only good for turning into a
pogchamp.

1:01:08.210,1:01:11.640
Trog: It just turns into like, an-an atomic
bomb.

1:01:11.640,1:01:15.200
Wayne: [Laughs] I like both kinds of chats.
And I’ve noticed

1:01:15.200,1:01:19.329
too, like, I can have a chat start like that,
and then if I let the stream go

1:01:19.329,1:01:23.329
on too long into weird hours, I can like,
go back down to a tier two style

1:01:23.329,1:01:27.370
chat, like when I did-when I did the Dark
Souls-I did the Dark Souls San Andreas

1:01:27.370,1:01:32.041
stream when I streamed for ten hours ‘till
like 9AM and uh, that was really fun

1:01:32.041,1:01:35.460
because the chat did slow down and I got to
have like, more conversations.

1:01:35.460,1:01:37.900
Gir: Yeah, your chat was nice and-nice and
calm that whole

1:01:37.900,1:01:38.900
time.

1:01:38.900,1:01:39.900
Wayne: Nice and calm.

1:01:39.900,1:01:40.900
Trog: Yeah.

1:01:40.900,1:01:42.330
Wayne: It’s fun-it’s fun to do a chill
stream occasionally,

1:01:42.330,1:01:46.600
but the-I do-I do thrive on the chaos. Uh,
and then—so, and then I guess the

1:01:46.600,1:01:50.670
only person I haven’t directly asked about
the streams here is Log. Log, you

1:01:50.670,1:01:54.820
have, like, your main streams like, you’ve
been streaming Hylics 2, right? But

1:01:54.820,1:01:57.549
then you, you’ve-you’ve been doing the
art streams lately—Did you do a Gather

1:01:57.549,1:01:58.760
Ye Power stream this week?

1:01:58.760,1:02:02.799
Log: Yeah. Um, that’s what I did on Sunday
before I started

1:02:02.799,1:02:03.799
playing Hylics.

1:02:03.799,1:02:07.059
Wayne: So, Log is a totally different niche
covered in art, none of us are doing that.

1:02:07.059,1:02:10.079
Log: Yeah, it’s kind of a weird thing ‘cause
it’s like, I don’t

1:02:10.079,1:02:14.810
think it’s something that people are generally
interested in, and like, I-I get

1:02:14.810,1:02:20.029
it, ‘cause like even I’m not interested
in that necessarily, like, um, the-the

1:02:20.029,1:02:22.589
guy who makes One-Punch Man, um—

1:02:22.589,1:02:23.589
Gir: ONE?

1:02:23.589,1:02:25.589
Log: Uh no, Yusuke Murata.

1:02:25.589,1:02:26.589
Gir: Oh.

1:02:26.589,1:02:30.990
Log: He-he does stream him working on the
new chapters, but

1:02:30.990,1:02:34.079
like, even if I was interested, I don’t
really want to like, tune in.

1:02:34.079,1:02:35.079
Gir: [Crosstalk] Huh!

1:02:35.079,1:02:37.809
Log: I don’t really, feel the-the need to
watch the process

1:02:37.809,1:02:42.750
in real-time, ‘cause when you get down to
it, art is just-it’s slow. Like, you’re

1:02:42.750,1:02:44.510
just there to have a little chat, really.

1:02:44.510,1:02:45.510
Wayne: Mhmm.

1:02:45.510,1:02:46.510
Trog: Yeah.

1:02:46.510,1:02:48.500
Log: Uhm, and whenever I’m working on it
I just tend to

1:02:48.500,1:02:53.619
mumble to myself what I’m doing, so that’s
not really like, the best viewer

1:02:53.619,1:02:58.390
experience. However, um, after switching over
to Hylics 2 and playing a little

1:02:58.390,1:03:01.700
bit of that on stream for the first time,
I feel like that’s like, what feels

1:03:01.700,1:03:07.220
most natural to me. ‘Cause like, I think
the way that I work is that whenever I

1:03:07.220,1:03:11.930
am-am knowledgeable about something in a game
I will like-I will just kind of

1:03:11.930,1:03:18.010
like, gush about it, and then whenever it
gets into the stuff that I’m not as

1:03:18.010,1:03:22.570
knowledgeable about it, it’s much easier
for something like Hylics where I just

1:03:22.570,1:03:29.710
get to just like, see it and handle it at
whatever pace. It gives me time to like

1:03:29.710,1:03:31.369
just think about what’s going on.

1:03:31.369,1:03:32.571
Gir: Oh, yeah, I feel that.

1:03:32.571,1:03:35.210
Trog: Personally, I really like the art streams
because they’re

1:03:35.210,1:03:39.080
just kind of like, well, it’s different
for me than the viewers because

1:03:39.080,1:03:42.180
whenever you’re doing an art stream I can
just pop in and like have a chat,

1:03:42.180,1:03:43.180
like, for real—

1:03:43.180,1:03:44.180
Wayne: Mhmm.

1:03:44.180,1:03:46.880
Trog: But I feel that it’s like-it’s kind
of that atmosphere

1:03:46.880,1:03:50.700
where it’s like, you’re right, art is
slow, but that means that if you aren’t

1:03:50.700,1:03:54.720
paying full attention, you aren’t going
to miss anything. Like, it really is

1:03:54.720,1:03:58.440
just something to turn on and listen to and
be like, “I’m gonna listen to these

1:03:58.440,1:04:02.510
people have a conversation,” y’know. It’s
kind of like a podcast in itself.

1:04:02.510,1:04:06.309
Wayne: And also, Log’s got that baller taste
in music. So

1:04:06.309,1:04:07.309
that also helps.

1:04:07.309,1:04:10.130
Trog: Yeah, the music’s good. It’s fun
to play stream DJ. I’ve

1:04:10.130,1:04:14.260
been having a lot of fun just finding cool
music I like to play at the start of

1:04:14.260,1:04:16.000
my stream, that’s always fun.

1:04:16.000,1:04:17.000
Wayne: Mhmm.

1:04:17.000,1:04:19.140
Log: Like, that-that—I feel like part of
the thing where I

1:04:19.140,1:04:23.240
like these kind of RPG games, especially the
ones like Hylics that are just

1:04:23.240,1:04:28.650
very interesting to see visually, is that
I don’t really like, think in terms

1:04:28.650,1:04:32.450
of what’s really going on, I don’t know,
it just feels very—

1:04:32.450,1:04:33.450
Trog: Abstract?

1:04:33.450,1:04:37.220
Log: It just feels very nat-it just feels
very natural to just

1:04:37.220,1:04:40.589
like, determine something completely-just
come up with something just completely

1:04:40.589,1:04:42.910
different than what’s just on screen.

1:04:42.910,1:04:43.910
Trog: Mhmm.

1:04:43.910,1:04:46.920
Log: I don’t-I don’t know-I don’t know
how to like, I don’t

1:04:46.920,1:04:49.210
know how to-how to properly describe it. It
just feels funnier.

1:04:49.210,1:04:50.210
Trog: Heh.

1:04:50.210,1:04:52.750
Log: Just because it’s-it just feels inherently
funny just

1:04:52.750,1:04:57.410
because of like, being able to slow it down
and take in all the stuff and see

1:04:57.410,1:04:58.600
all the weird things.

1:04:58.600,1:04:59.600
Trog: Yeah.

1:04:59.600,1:05:00.600
Wayne: Mhmm.

1:05:00.600,1:05:04.950
Trog: I mean that’s-that’s definitely—I
mean, that’s how Scorpy streams every game.

1:05:04.950,1:05:09.579
Scorpy-Scorpy basically patented the, “stop
everything that I am doing in the game and

1:05:09.579,1:05:12.400
zoom in on something weird on the screen,”
like—

1:05:12.400,1:05:16.750
Wayne: [Laughs] He was doing that-he was doing
that long before we were even like, thinking

1:05:16.750,1:05:21.490
of like having a Twitch Team and doing this
as a group. Like, Scorpy—I like-I have such

1:05:21.490,1:05:26.069
a vivid memory of a Scorpy stream from like,
three years ago where we were watching him

1:05:26.069,1:05:30.810
play a game called like, Sphinx the Curse
of the Mummy or something like that. It’s

1:05:30.810,1:05:35.280
just this horrible-it’s not even horrible,
it’s just mediocre PS2 platformer where

1:05:35.280,1:05:40.740
you play as like, some kid in Egypt and you
jump around and like, I’ll never forget

1:05:40.740,1:05:46.289
like, just this-this time where he just stopped
the stream, was just like, silent for three

1:05:46.289,1:05:51.460
minutes, and then zooms in on a sarcophagus
and just pops up a little notepad window and

1:05:51.460,1:05:55.270
it says—and it just said, I probably have
the screenshot somewhere, it just said in

1:05:55.270,1:05:57.990
plain text, all caps, “ENTERING THE SARCOPHAGUS
WILL

1:05:57.990,1:06:01.670
KILL HIM” and it just hung on that for like
two minutes.

1:06:01.670,1:06:02.900
Trog: [Laughs] Yeah.

1:06:02.900,1:06:04.290
Wayne: I will never forget that.

1:06:04.290,1:06:09.079
Gir: Something I want to say is uh, had things
been different,

1:06:09.079,1:06:14.710
in terms of the ability to travel, I guarantee
you I would have been doing

1:06:14.710,1:06:16.420
fishing streams every now and then.

1:06:16.420,1:06:17.420
Trog: Yeah.

1:06:17.420,1:06:18.420
Wayne: That’d be fun.

1:06:18.420,1:06:19.420
Baaulp: Ohhh, damn.

1:06:19.420,1:06:22.160
Gir: Had I had the opportunity to go on my
vacation that I originally

1:06:22.160,1:06:26.589
was gonna go on, I definitely would have done
that like, several times.

1:06:26.589,1:06:29.270
Wayne: So, I have like a number of IRL stream-type
stuff

1:06:29.270,1:06:33.040
like that that I’ve wanted to do, and like
people are always saying, “Wayne, woods

1:06:33.040,1:06:36.910
stream?” Like that’s the meme, that’s
the joke. Like they always ask me for

1:06:36.910,1:06:39.990
woods stream. And I always say “I’ll give
you woods stream one day,” which will

1:06:39.990,1:06:43.030
be a stream where I will walk around the woods.
There have like those streaming

1:06:43.030,1:06:47.319
backpacks you can buy that are like twenty-five
hundred dollars and like, honestly

1:06:47.319,1:06:50.340
like, that might be a good investment one
day if I want to do more of this, but

1:06:50.340,1:06:53.369
that’s a good segue. Just recently—

1:06:53.369,1:06:54.510
Gir: Segway, you say.

1:06:54.510,1:06:58.700
Wayne: [Laughs] I didn’t, I don’t have
a Segway. The-just recently,

1:06:58.700,1:07:01.560
I’ve-I keep talking about it on stream like,
“Oh yeah, I’m getting into a

1:07:01.560,1:07:05.890
hobby,” and like I-like I haven’t wanted
to tell people about it because I wasn’t

1:07:05.890,1:07:11.300
sure one hundred percent if I could pull it
off, I wasn’t-I maybe wanted it to

1:07:11.300,1:07:14.220
be a surprise like if I did a stream with
it, and I think one day I’ll maybe do

1:07:14.220,1:07:21.220
streams with it, the—I uh, just last week,
uh, got-I received my first ever

1:07:21.220,1:07:25.730
electric unicycle, uh-the, which is a personal
electric vehicle. 

1:07:25.730,1:07:29.480
Wayne: Think a hoverboard-kind of like a hoverboard,
but one

1:07:29.480,1:07:35.250
wheel, much more powerful, much more serious.
Uh, the-it, I got it last week on

1:07:35.250,1:07:42.400
Friday, and I have been absolutely obsessed
with it since like… when would it have

1:07:42.400,1:07:49.460
been… I think-I think I-I figured it out
um, Satur-it was Sunday—No, no, no,

1:07:49.460,1:07:52.539
Sunday is when I figured it out, Sunday’s
when it clicked, and Sunday is when

1:07:52.539,1:07:56.490
it like-I just fell in fuckin’ love with
it. I got it Friday night and I was in

1:07:56.490,1:08:01.339
the call here I-I took it outside and uh,
I put it up, put it up behind my car.

1:08:01.339,1:08:06.420
Like, the first steps you’re supposed to
take with the electric unicycle is like,

1:08:06.420,1:08:10.369
you’re supposed to support yourself against
a wall, stand on it, and just like

1:08:10.369,1:08:13.849
wheel back and forth and just like feel what
that’s like. And I was doing that,

1:08:13.849,1:08:18.870
and then like, I had never felt more exhausted
just like jumping on that thing,

1:08:18.870,1:08:22.839
standing on it for two seconds, and then falling
off. It was like, killing me.

1:08:22.839,1:08:27.489
I was-I like-I-I like couldn’t catch my
breath for like three minutes, it was

1:08:27.489,1:08:28.489
bad.

1:08:28.489,1:08:32.900
Wayne: Um, and then I, just this last weekend
I went away

1:08:32.900,1:08:36.770
for a funeral, and uh, we were at-we were
at the funeral home and like we did

1:08:36.770,1:08:40.040
our stuff for a few good hours, paid our respects,
and I went outside to like

1:08:40.040,1:08:43.529
practice, and I got like so discouraged because
I was like, trying to do it and

1:08:43.529,1:08:49.390
it was just like, hurting the shit out of
me, and I couldn’t pull off like anything.

1:08:49.390,1:08:53.109
The—Whe-whe-when you guys were young, how
long did it take you to learn how to

1:08:53.109,1:08:54.940
ride a bike? Do you think? Or do-do—

1:08:54.940,1:08:56.199
Gir: God, I don’t remember, you kidding
me?

1:08:56.199,1:08:57.199
Baaulp: I don’t remember.

1:08:57.199,1:08:58.270
Trog: Yeah, I don’t know.

1:08:58.270,1:09:02.230
Baaulp: At this point I haven’t rode a bike
in so long I

1:09:02.230,1:09:04.239
think-I think I’ve gone back down to zero.

1:09:04.239,1:09:07.409
Wayne: You fuckin’ like—this is off-topic,
this is a tangent,

1:09:07.409,1:09:10.410
too, but you-you obviously know the saying,
you know the saying, like, “You never

1:09:10.410,1:09:13.270
forget how to ride a bike.” If I gave you
a bike, do you think you could ride

1:09:13.270,1:09:14.270
it right now? Well?

1:09:14.270,1:09:15.270
Baaulp: No. No [laughs].

1:09:15.270,1:09:17.200
Wayne: I feel like I couldn’t, either. I
feel like-like—

1:09:17.200,1:09:19.770
Trog: Really? I absolutely could ride a bike
still.

1:09:19.770,1:09:20.770
Log: No idea.

1:09:20.770,1:09:23.940
Wayne: Maybe-I mean I’ve been building up
my balance with

1:09:23.940,1:09:28.760
this thing so maybe I could do it, but like,
so, the first night I put in an hour, I could

1:09:28.760,1:09:32.600
maybe stay on the wheel for like, three seconds
before I’d have to jump

1:09:32.600,1:09:37.609
off of it. Second day, I couldn’t even get
that. I don’t-I don’t know why. I’ve

1:09:37.609,1:09:43.049
been using this forum, which is a bizarre
experience because it is literally like a

1:09:43.049,1:09:48.290
PHB internet forum, it’s crazy that it still
exists and it’s not like some other kind

1:09:48.290,1:09:50.810
of-like a-like a Reddit community or whatever.

1:09:50.810,1:09:51.810
Trog: Other than Discord.

1:09:51.810,1:09:54.270
Wayne: Yeah-yeah it’s not just a Discord,
it’s like an

1:09:54.270,1:09:59.420
actual genuine forum, it feels fuckin’ weird.
It’s like I’m going back in time.

1:09:59.420,1:10:03.320
But like, I was-I was asking for tips and
doing research, and like, the-the

1:10:03.320,1:10:07.720
advice that I got, there were-there were three
prevailing pieces of advice. The-in

1:10:07.720,1:10:12.270
order to learn how to ride an electric unicycle.
The-the first piece of advice

1:10:12.270,1:10:16.890
was uh, don’t try to do it alone. Like,
much like a child riding a bike, much

1:10:16.890,1:10:21.020
how your dad or your mom would like hold you
and then let you go, you need to

1:10:21.020,1:10:24.030
do that. You need to have someone to hold
your hand and then like, you need to

1:10:24.030,1:10:30.440
like put weight on them as you-as you ride
like a good like, twenty-or-so feet.

1:10:30.440,1:10:34.770
The second piece of advice was in order to
brake, you need to just like, you

1:10:34.770,1:10:39.080
need to sit down. Like you just need to pretend
to sit down. Or else you will like—it

1:10:39.080,1:10:41.850
will just not fuckin’ work. ‘Cause the
first problem I was having was anytime I

1:10:41.850,1:10:46.240
tried to stop, I would just start accelerating
and turning and it was so scary.

1:10:46.240,1:10:47.240
[Trog laughs]

1:10:47.240,1:10:49.730
Wayne: The, uh, like-like the way an electric
unicycle works

1:10:49.730,1:10:53.120
is you learn forward to go fast and accelerate,
like you put pressure on like,

1:10:53.120,1:10:56.659
the ball of your foot, and to stop you put
it on your heels. But you have to,

1:10:56.659,1:10:59.340
you have to know how to distribute your body
weight properly in order to do

1:10:59.340,1:11:03.520
that. So I don’t know what I was doing,
I think I was trying to like,

1:11:03.520,1:11:07.210
push back on my heels and like—but then
I was putting more pressure on the ball

1:11:07.210,1:11:09.850
of my feet too, because I didn’t want to
fall off, like-I-like I think I was

1:11:09.850,1:11:13.960
trying to like, lift my toes, which would
have like killed me, so it was just making

1:11:13.960,1:11:17.800
me go super fast and spinning in circles,
and I almost ate shit a few times.

1:11:17.800,1:11:18.800
[Trog laughs]

1:11:18.800,1:11:22.230
Trog: Do you feel like you’re a more clownlike
individual

1:11:22.230,1:11:24.429
after purchasing this unicycle?

1:11:24.429,1:11:26.040
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeahhhh, that’s the
real question.

1:11:26.040,1:11:29.960
Wayne: That’s the thing. I keep walking
into it. I keep like-like,

1:11:29.960,1:11:32.370
I was just like joking around with my friends,
I just said like, like in an

1:11:32.370,1:11:36.440
excited voice one day, I was just like, “I’m
going to go ride my unicycle,”

1:11:36.440,1:11:37.440
[Baaulp and Log laugh]

1:11:37.440,1:11:40.880
Wayne: And there was like-someone was like,
“Okay, Bozo,” like-fuckin’, [laughs]

1:11:40.880,1:11:42.690
it was just—so now I’m kind of—

1:11:42.690,1:11:45.001
Trog: Wayne is becoming a clownlike individual,
this is

1:11:45.001,1:11:49.460
all-look, it’s fine, you wanted to be a
cl-you’ve told us you’ve always wanted

1:11:49.460,1:11:50.840
to be a clown, I’ve always been supportive—

1:11:50.840,1:11:51.840
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:11:51.840,1:11:53.810
Gir: I know-we know you dropped out of clown
college.

1:11:53.810,1:11:56.850
Trog: Buying this unicycle is the first step,
I’m going to

1:11:56.850,1:12:00.650
get you a set of balloon animal balloons for
your birthday—

1:12:00.650,1:12:01.650
[Wayne laughs]

1:12:01.650,1:12:04.380
Baaulp: Did someone like accidentally drop
a bunch of fruit

1:12:04.380,1:12:09.040
like, on you and the-from like a higher elevation
and then you just like instant-and

1:12:09.040,1:12:13.950
then you just instantly started juggling like
a bunch of apples [laughs].

1:12:13.950,1:12:16.130
Wayne: [Laughs] Juggling it? I was-okay, I-I
didn’t

1:12:16.130,1:12:18.520
catch on that that was where you were going
with that and was like, what the

1:12:18.520,1:12:22.730
fuck are you talking about? I thought-I—No,
I thought like, my-my-the first

1:12:22.730,1:12:25.420
thing I was thinking was like, “Is he going
to make some sort of joke

1:12:25.420,1:12:28.060
about like, getting hit with fruit makes you
a clown?” Like—

1:12:28.060,1:12:29.060
[Gir laughs]

1:12:29.060,1:12:30.790
Trog: Well, getting hit with fruit does make
you a

1:12:30.790,1:12:31.909
clown, let’s be honest.

1:12:31.909,1:12:33.040
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:12:33.040,1:12:35.861
Trog: All I’m saying is that, unicycle step
one, balloon

1:12:35.861,1:12:39.930
animal step two, pulling infinite scarves
out of your mouth step three.

1:12:39.930,1:12:42.660
Wayne: Hey, your hands are totally free on
any unicycle, so

1:12:42.660,1:12:44.080
I could learn to juggle on it.

1:12:44.080,1:12:46.770
Baaulp: Well it’s a-it’s an electric unicycle
so we keep

1:12:46.770,1:12:49.250
joking that you’ll be some type of cyber-clown.

1:12:49.250,1:12:52.130
Wayne: That’d be dope. So, but I’ve been-I’ve
been givin’ in

1:12:52.130,1:12:56.360
to the clown jokes because it is funny, like,
I’ll just say like, I’ve-I’ve

1:12:56.360,1:12:59.080
just said like-I-I-I was in the Discord the
other day and I think I said

1:12:59.080,1:13:02.030
something along the lines I was like, “Guys,
I think I’m addicted to this unicycle

1:13:02.030,1:13:04.260
and getting into small cars.” And like [laughs]—

1:13:04.260,1:13:05.260
[Baaulp laughs]

1:13:05.260,1:13:06.780
Trog: It’s true. Wayne is becoming a clownlike
individual.

1:13:06.780,1:13:09.989
Wayne: Alright, but the opposite effect is
happening—

1:13:09.989,1:13:13.830
Log: I’m imagining like, a clown rolling
in with a-with a-like

1:13:13.830,1:13:18.280
a squirt flower that fires that one like,
high powered laser [laughs] instead

1:13:18.280,1:13:19.280
of water.

1:13:19.280,1:13:20.280
[Trog laughs]

1:13:20.280,1:13:23.270
Wayne: [Laughs] Like the fucking-like the
fucking-like WEEDO

1:13:23.270,1:13:24.270
advertised one?

1:13:24.270,1:13:25.270
Log, laughing: Yeah.

1:13:25.270,1:13:26.270
[Wayne laughs]

1:13:26.270,1:13:27.679
Log: Just burns things into wood.

1:13:27.679,1:13:31.870
Wayne: Burns things very slowly, [laughs]
like it’s just-like

1:13:31.870,1:13:35.730
I-like I-I squeeze my little flower and very
slowly light you on fire, you have

1:13:35.730,1:13:36.730
to stand still.

1:13:36.730,1:13:38.550
Gir: [Crosstalk] James Bond type clown.

1:13:38.550,1:13:41.300
Wayne: [Laughs] Yeah. Um, but yeah, so the
second piece of

1:13:41.300,1:13:44.500
advice was yes, sit down to brake, which worked
amazingly, and the third piece of

1:13:44.500,1:13:48.590
advice was don’t just-don’t do it on like
a street, do it in like a parking

1:13:48.590,1:13:53.730
lot, in an open area because like, much like
a bike-like, if you-if you try-if

1:13:53.730,1:13:56.610
you try to just go straight and that’s your
first objective, you’re gonna fail.

1:13:56.610,1:13:59.179
When you-when you feel like you’re going
to fall just like on a bike, you have

1:13:59.179,1:14:02.909
to like turn into it. So I ended up like swervin’
around a little bit. And on

1:14:02.909,1:14:06.710
Sunday I was like, we-we were-it was a family
trip so I asked my mom, “Can you

1:14:06.710,1:14:08.400
come out-can you-can you come with me to the
uh—”

1:14:08.400,1:14:09.400
Trog: To the circus.

1:14:09.400,1:14:11.120
Wayne: “—to the parking lot and like help
me practice?” And

1:14:11.120,1:14:15.040
she was like, “Sure.” She was like, “Sure,”
and uh, so like I held onto her—I got

1:14:15.040,1:14:20.400
my gear on and I got in the parking lot, we-we-we
went into the big top, and so

1:14:20.400,1:14:21.400
I—

1:14:21.400,1:14:22.400
[Baaulp laughs]

1:14:22.400,1:14:25.840
Wayne: [Laughs] We-we went to the parking
lot, I grabbed her hand, and I started-and

1:14:25.840,1:14:28.739
I like, I maybe had her hold my hand for five
minutes

1:14:28.739,1:14:33.040
and I was just like, let go, and I don’t
know what happened, I just got it. And I was

1:14:33.040,1:14:38.030
just like doing everything. Like, everything
felt possible, like going at the max speed,

1:14:38.030,1:14:42.210
turning, braking, I could do every single
part of it and it felt fuckin’ crazy because

1:14:42.210,1:14:46.680
two days ago I was literally like—I felt
like death just trying to stay on the thing.

1:14:46.680,1:14:49.600
Baaulp: You saw like a wire and you started
going on that

1:14:49.600,1:14:50.600
and then someone—

1:14:50.600,1:14:51.710
Trog: Did you have a joy buzzer in your hand?

1:14:51.710,1:14:52.710
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:14:52.710,1:14:53.710
[Wayne laughs]

1:14:53.710,1:14:56.770
Baaulp: And then you went acr-and then you
went across the wire

1:14:56.770,1:15:00.870
effortlessly, but then midway through someone
tossed you like a giant metal rod—

1:15:00.870,1:15:02.700
Wayne: Mhmm. There was one time where I had
a hard time

1:15:02.700,1:15:06.060
braking so I shot the handkerchiefs out of
my mouth and used it to rope around

1:15:06.060,1:15:07.590
the light post to stop myself.

1:15:07.590,1:15:08.590
Trog: [Unintelligible].

1:15:08.590,1:15:09.620
Baaulp, laughing: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

1:15:09.620,1:15:10.969
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:15:10.969,1:15:14.449
Wayne: The, um, but yeah no, and then uh,
and then like I

1:15:14.449,1:15:18.780
tried it one more time the next day on my
way home, we-we stopped at a big

1:15:18.780,1:15:22.330
parking lot and I was-I tried like-I tried
some harder shit like going down and

1:15:22.330,1:15:27.560
uphill. Had some failures there, some success.
Uh, the-and then I got home from

1:15:27.560,1:15:32.469
my trip yesterday and took it out on the street
and then I just realized like,

1:15:32.469,1:15:37.260
I feel like my grasp on this is that of which
people have described they get after

1:15:37.260,1:15:41.219
like, multiple weeks of riding it. Like I
feel fully confident riding on it at

1:15:41.219,1:15:45.199
like full speeds, doing tight turns like without
any gear, which is dangerous

1:15:45.199,1:15:48.370
and scary and I’m not doing—Don’t worry,
people listening at home, don’t be

1:15:48.370,1:15:50.310
scared for me, I’m wearing gear when I’m
s’posed to.

1:15:50.310,1:15:54.890
Wayne: The uh, but like, like last night I-I-I
got in the Discord

1:15:54.890,1:15:57.580
call and I went for a joyride and I just rode
around my neighborhood on like a

1:15:57.580,1:16:00.920
bunch of like cracked, like pothole-y roads
and I could still-I could still

1:16:00.920,1:16:06.590
handle it. I’ve been… in love with this
thing. I road it all day today, that’s

1:16:06.590,1:16:09.380
pretty much all I did, I was out there for
maybe like three or four hours.

1:16:09.380,1:16:16.660
Baaulp: I think this is what people describe
as flow. Like, like it is-it has a term—

1:16:16.660,1:16:17.660
Wayne: Mhmm.

1:16:17.660,1:16:20.750
Baaulp: It’s called flow when like, that
feeling you get when like you’re trying

1:16:20.750,1:16:25.690
to get something—I only know about it because
of fighting games, but like—it is-it is

1:16:25.690,1:16:30.469
the same here, it’s like yeah, it just clicks
for you and you just get it. And you’re

1:16:30.469,1:16:32.370
just in the zone and uh—

1:16:32.370,1:16:33.370
Wayne: Yeah, absolutely.

1:16:33.370,1:16:35.000
Baaulp: And the-and the reason why you picked
it up in a few

1:16:35.000,1:16:39.739
days whereas some—uh, is because you’re
not old, your mind is young and fresh.

1:16:39.739,1:16:44.820
Wayne: I guess so. The forum that I use uh,
a large majority of its users are in their

1:16:44.820,1:16:50.469
like, fifties and it’s funny. It’s like-like
these people are not people I would be associating

1:16:50.469,1:16:53.970
with and like-like-a lot like—there are
a couple—there are a lot of like, you see

1:16:53.970,1:16:58.810
electric unicycle YouTubers um, like some
of my favorites like—one of my favorites

1:16:58.810,1:17:02.140
is this probably like late
twenties early thirties guy from China, he’s

1:17:02.140,1:17:05.290
really cool, he’s like amazing at it, he
does insane shit that I don’t think I’ll

1:17:05.290,1:17:08.300
be doing for like a long time. Uh, there’s
like another-there’s another guy from New

1:17:08.300,1:17:11.050
York who’s like probably
late twenties, uh, and then there’s-and

1:17:11.050,1:17:16.820
then you just-it just procedurally goes
up. My next favorite YouTuber is like, this-this

1:17:16.820,1:17:20.790
guy in his forties who’s like
a dad and his kids are in all of his videos,

1:17:20.790,1:17:24.400
and then you go even further and
like the absolute like, enthusiasts who are

1:17:24.400,1:17:28.120
like, ripping open their unicycles
and like, they know like about all the motherboards

1:17:28.120,1:17:31.080
and shit, and all the
intense intricate shit, they’re like fifty

1:17:31.080,1:17:35.030
and sixty and seventy. These old ass
men doing this shit.

1:17:35.030,1:17:37.460
Trog: There’s no way a seventy-year-old
is riding an

1:17:37.460,1:17:39.370
electric unicycle. They would die.

1:17:39.370,1:17:43.070
Wayne: They could do it! They could do it.
Like it-like it—I

1:17:43.070,1:17:47.010
think-I think like if you put your mind to
it, and you like trust yourself, I think

1:17:47.010,1:17:48.010
anyone could do it. Genuinely.

1:17:48.010,1:17:51.030
Gir: If you can think it, you can do it.

1:17:51.030,1:17:55.889
Wayne: Yeah. You-yeah. Prepare to mutate!
Prepare to mutate!

1:17:55.889,1:17:57.230
EUC! The [laughs]—

1:17:57.230,1:18:01.050
Baaulp: I’m not into this, but it does give
me hope that I’ll

1:18:01.050,1:18:05.110
be able to play fighting games as an old man
and then people-and then-and then

1:18:05.110,1:18:11.850
when I beat my grandkids with like the hardest
Kazuya combos in Tekken 70 they

1:18:11.850,1:18:13.179
might get fed up and—

1:18:13.179,1:18:14.179
[Wayne laughs]

1:18:14.179,1:18:17.530
Baaulp: They get fed up and-they get fed up
and hack my-hack

1:18:17.530,1:18:18.530
my life support.

1:18:18.530,1:18:19.530
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Tekken 70…

1:18:19.530,1:18:20.530
Trog: You’re going to the home!

1:18:20.530,1:18:21.910
Wayne: For Tekken 70—[laughs] Hack your
life support!

1:18:21.910,1:18:22.910
[Baaulp laughs]

1:18:22.910,1:18:25.310
Gir: Extend my life with a life hack—See!
A literal life hack!

1:18:25.310,1:18:26.850
Baaulp, laughing: It’s a life hack!

1:18:26.850,1:18:28.880
Wayne: They plug your keyboard into their
brain like

1:18:28.880,1:18:32.900
Cyberpunk and they stare at you and they think,
“Kill grandpa!” As they type in

1:18:32.900,1:18:33.900
the codes.

1:18:33.900,1:18:35.570
Gir, laughing: Gain six more months with this
life hack!

1:18:35.570,1:18:37.980
Wayne: Hey, if Tekken 70 is going to come
out in our

1:18:37.980,1:18:41.880
lifetime I think game sequels as a whole are
going to be very different, huh?

1:18:41.880,1:18:43.690
Like that’s not gonna happen.

1:18:43.690,1:18:46.640
Baaulp: No, I-I just pulled a number out of
my ass.

1:18:46.640,1:18:49.910
Wayne: I know, what the hell is Tekken 70
going to be like?

1:18:49.910,1:18:50.910
Trog: It’s a racing game.

1:18:50.910,1:18:52.639
Gir: You don’t know because all the characters
that’re

1:18:52.639,1:18:54.150
replacing the ones you know now don’t exist.

1:18:54.150,1:18:56.610
Log: It’s a game of thought and action.

1:18:56.610,1:18:59.250
Baaulp: Yeah. Just like fighting games now—Heyyy!

1:18:59.250,1:19:00.250
Gir: Heyyy! [Unintelligible]

1:19:00.250,1:19:03.810
Wayne: The only classic Tekken character that’s
left is Jack

1:19:03.810,1:19:04.810
70.

1:19:04.810,1:19:05.810
[Baaulp laughs]

1:19:05.810,1:19:06.810
Wayne: All the others—it’s a-it’s a
totally new cast, but

1:19:06.810,1:19:07.810
there is still Jack 70.

1:19:07.810,1:19:11.171
Trog: Jack 70, he’s here. Because he doesn’t
age! He’s a

1:19:11.171,1:19:12.171
robot! They just keep making new ones!

1:19:12.171,1:19:15.409
Wayne: Bro, what the fuck—what would Jack
70 look like? For

1:19:15.409,1:19:18.790
reference, if you guys don’t know, uh listeners
at home, what Jack is, there’s

1:19:18.790,1:19:22.400
a character that’s been in every Tekken
game, his name is Jack, he’s a big

1:19:22.400,1:19:26.949
robot, he’s a big, white dude that’s a
robot with like fucked up, crazy extend-o

1:19:26.949,1:19:30.811
arms and he’s been in every game but he
gets-he gets a new revision. Jack, Jack

1:19:30.811,1:19:35.880
2, Jack 3, Jack 4, Jack 5, Jack 6, Jack 7.
What is Jack 70? Like how do they keep—

1:19:35.880,1:19:39.000
Log: I think he’s gonna look like a nucleus
with plasma

1:19:39.000,1:19:40.000
tendrils.

1:19:40.000,1:19:41.000
Baaulp, laughing: Yeah.

1:19:41.000,1:19:42.000
[Wayne laughs]

1:19:42.000,1:19:43.000
Trog: He’s a clownlike individual.

1:19:43.000,1:19:45.540
Wayne: They lose his visage of a racist man,
he-he no longer

1:19:45.540,1:19:48.900
looks like a military guy, he’s like a fuckin’
monster.

1:19:48.900,1:19:49.900
[Baaulp laughs]

1:19:49.900,1:19:52.020
Wayne: I have one last thing to say about
the unicycle

1:19:52.020,1:19:53.020
before we move on.

1:19:53.020,1:19:54.160
Trog: [Crosstalk] Uh-huh uh-huh, talk-talk
more about your

1:19:54.160,1:19:55.160
unicycle.

1:19:55.160,1:19:57.821
Wayne: Uh, well, I’ve been practicing-I’ve
been practicing

1:19:57.821,1:20:00.820
the seltzer bottle bit while on the unicycle
and I got like a good few

1:20:00.820,1:20:01.820
people with it.

1:20:01.820,1:20:02.820
Gir: [Crosstalk] Uh-huh, wow that’s a very
crazy bit—

1:20:02.820,1:20:04.900
Trog: [Laughs]
Okay, hang on though, if you actually record

1:20:04.900,1:20:09.020
a video of you riding on an
electric unicycle and spraying—and like

1:20:09.020,1:20:13.440
drive-by spraying people with a seltzer
bottle, I will give you like, ten dollars.

1:20:13.440,1:20:14.440
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:20:14.440,1:20:17.600
Wayne: Oh man. It’d have to be someone I
know, though,

1:20:17.600,1:20:22.380
because I think-I think like, adding the unicycle
in there makes that like,

1:20:22.380,1:20:23.380
scarier for strangers.

1:20:23.380,1:20:24.860
Trog: But that’s why it’s funny.

1:20:24.860,1:20:28.250
Wayne: Gir—I was talking to-like I was-I
was in a call with Gir while I was on my joyride

1:20:28.250,1:20:31.170
last night and like, Gir was saying like,
“Yeah, you should bring like—” I feel

1:20:31.170,1:20:32.290
like you said for some reason that, “—you
should bring a bat.”

1:20:32.290,1:20:33.719
Trog: [Laughs] You should bring a bat?

1:20:33.719,1:20:36.970
Gir: Yeah-yeah, no ‘cause your-your gear
makes you look like

1:20:36.970,1:20:39.760
a Cyberpunk like, hell man.

1:20:39.760,1:20:43.760
Wayne: I look like—No, genuinely, when I’m
fully geared up, I look like a Hotline Miami

1:20:43.760,1:20:49.000
character like, I look like-like if I had
a bat I just would be. The-but yeah, I need

1:20:49.000,1:20:51.470
to be careful because like, I did last night
on

1:20:51.470,1:20:55.480
my—I want to talk about a few experiences
that I’ve had about riding the thing. I-so

1:20:55.480,1:20:59.230
I took it out on the roads for the first time
last night, and within the first twenty minutes

1:20:59.230,1:21:05.850
uh, I got stopped by a cop. Um, it happened
almost immediately uh, the, and it was a very

1:21:05.850,1:21:08.530
strange interaction. The like, chat—

1:21:08.530,1:21:09.530
Gir: Chat?

1:21:09.530,1:21:12.850
Wayne: I hate when I call them chat. Listeners
at home—it’s different with a podcast!

1:21:12.850,1:21:18.719
I’m-I’m never used to that. Listeners
at home, as you know, ACAB, fuck cops, the—So

1:21:18.719,1:21:22.780
like, pretty much when I interact with a cop
I do my best to just get out of it as soon

1:21:22.780,1:21:28.950
as possible, like I like, so when I was talking
to him, he comes up to me and he’s like,

1:21:28.950,1:21:32.389
“Hey buddy,” and I’m like, “Hey, how’s-how’s
it goin’,” and he’s like, “What is

1:21:32.389,1:21:35.570
that thing?” And I’m like, “It’s an
electric unicycle.” And he says, “Shouldn’t

1:21:35.570,1:21:39.570
you be riding that thing during the day?”
And I’m like, “No, I got a headlight,

1:21:39.570,1:21:44.150
I can see. There’s not that many cars out.”
And he’s like, “Aight, don’t-try not

1:21:44.150,1:21:45.420
to get hit by a car.”

1:21:45.420,1:21:46.420
Trog, laughing: Okay.

1:21:46.420,1:21:47.850
Gir, laughing: That’s a good trick.

1:21:47.850,1:21:48.949
Wayne: And I’m like, “O-okay, I’m gonna-I’ll
try that.”

1:21:48.949,1:21:52.480
The-and then I-I ride away, I ride away and
like, all the while, while that’s happening,

1:21:52.480,1:21:57.750
I’m in the Discord. I’m in our Discord
server with like Gir, Baaulp, a few

1:21:57.750,1:22:02.350
other people, Scorpy, the-and like Scorpy
the whole time is using our fucking YouTube

1:22:02.350,1:22:05.600
musicbot to play like, police siren noises
in my ears—

1:22:05.600,1:22:06.600
[Baaulp laughs]

1:22:06.600,1:22:09.550
Wayne: —Which is like, stressing me out
even more and I’m like, I drive away and

1:22:09.550,1:22:12.770
the first thing I’m like—I drive away
from the cop and the first thing I say is,

1:22:12.770,1:22:19.250
“Scorpy, fuck you. Fuck you, man.” The-uh,
I’m sure he got a laugh out of it. And then-so,

1:22:19.250,1:22:22.150
yeah—I drive another forty feet away or
somethin’ like that and then the cop turns

1:22:22.150,1:22:26.940
around and comes back, and-and he’s like,
“Hey, that thing’s pretty cool.” And

1:22:26.940,1:22:30.730
I’m like, “Yep, that’s why I bought
it.” And he said the dumbest thing, “It

1:22:30.730,1:22:32.440
has brakes and everything.”

1:22:32.440,1:22:33.510
Trog: Yeah, yeah.

1:22:33.510,1:22:36.440
Wayne: And I’m like, “Yeah, man.”

1:22:36.440,1:22:38.280
Gir: Yeah, I can stop. [Unintellgible]

1:22:38.280,1:22:39.280
[Baaulp laughs]

1:22:39.280,1:22:40.710
Wayne: You can-you don’t die when you accelerate
on this

1:22:40.710,1:22:41.710
thing.

1:22:41.710,1:22:42.710
Baaulp, laughing: Yeah?

1:22:42.710,1:22:44.360
Trog: He thought it was like the movie Speed
where if you go

1:22:44.360,1:22:47.340
under a certain miles per hour it’ll just
explode.

1:22:47.340,1:22:48.340
[Wayne laughs]

1:22:48.340,1:22:50.730
Baaulp: Dude, why isn’t that-why isn’t
that Speed 2. I wanna

1:22:50.730,1:22:54.720
Keanu Reeves on an electric unicycle that’s
going forty miles per hour, and if

1:22:54.720,1:22:55.840
it stops he blows up.

1:22:55.840,1:22:58.670
Gir: That doesn’t work though, ‘cause
he would jump off of the

1:22:58.670,1:23:00.550
fuckin’ thing and just let it explode fifty
feet down the street!

1:23:00.550,1:23:01.760
Trog: No, it follows you.

1:23:01.760,1:23:04.420
Baaulp: No! But then it blows up if you get
off!

1:23:04.420,1:23:06.780
Gir: Yeah, but it’ll explode fifty darn
feet down the street,

1:23:06.780,1:23:09.630
you’d jump off and you’d already be so
far away from it!

1:23:09.630,1:23:11.590
Wayne: Bro, it’s like-bro, it’s like a
bomb that could like

1:23:11.590,1:23:13.739
blow up a building, it would like, kill you
still.

1:23:13.739,1:23:14.739
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

1:23:14.739,1:23:15.739
Trog: [Crosstalk] Annihilate you.

1:23:15.739,1:23:16.739
Wayne: It doesn’t matter.

1:23:16.739,1:23:17.739
Gir: Uh, no, I would avoid it.

1:23:17.739,1:23:20.320
Wayne: I’d simply jump behind a barrel.
I’d get behind a

1:23:20.320,1:23:23.870
tree. So, uh, yeah, the rest of—other than
that-other than that encounter, the

1:23:23.870,1:23:27.360
rest of the joyride was like, super fun, and
it was like a very cool vibe to

1:23:27.360,1:23:30.800
just be riding around my town around like-around
like midnight with no one else

1:23:30.800,1:23:34.640
there just like, talking to my friends. Like,
the motorcycle helmet does a very

1:23:34.640,1:23:38.449
good job of insulating like, the audio. Like,
they heard me pretty well, I could

1:23:38.449,1:23:39.449
hear them perfectly.

1:23:39.449,1:23:42.639
Gir: And that’s where my point came in,
was-here’s this

1:23:42.639,1:23:46.320
man-I had even brought this up—Imagine you’re
walking down the street, it’s

1:23:46.320,1:23:49.810
like fucking midnight, you’re just out for
a night walk, and someone comes

1:23:49.810,1:23:54.370
riding down the street right next to you,
like right past you, dressed like a fucking

1:23:54.370,1:23:58.990
Hotline Miami character on a fucking electric
unicycle, and all you can hear as

1:23:58.990,1:24:01.790
they pass by is like, mumbling about random
shit.

1:24:01.790,1:24:02.790
[Trog laughs]

1:24:02.790,1:24:05.250
Wayne: I was like, “Man, nobody picks up
these sticks, who’s

1:24:05.250,1:24:08.290
pick-someone-picks up these sticks on the
sidewalk, we have no infrastructure,”

1:24:08.290,1:24:09.290
like—

1:24:09.290,1:24:10.290
[Baaulp laughs]

1:24:10.290,1:24:11.770
Trog, laughing: Just like a crazy person.

1:24:11.770,1:24:14.770
Wayne: Like-something-something like that
or like-or like, “Man,

1:24:14.770,1:24:18.150
Kirby Air Ride music is awesome,” was like
the other thing I was saying ‘cause

1:24:18.150,1:24:19.150
Gir was-I-Gir was like—

1:24:19.150,1:24:20.580
Gir: I kept playing Air Ride music.

1:24:20.580,1:24:22.910
Wayne: We-we were using the musicbot and I
was like, “Yo,

1:24:22.910,1:24:26.120
like, put on some-put on some music,” first
thing Scorpy does is he plays like,

1:24:26.120,1:24:27.120
the circu-the theme of the gladiators—

1:24:27.120,1:24:29.170
[Gir sings the beginning of Entry of the Gladiators]

1:24:29.170,1:24:30.690
Wayne: Fucking yeah, and I’m like, “No,
you fucking bitch,

1:24:30.690,1:24:31.690
don’t do that.”

1:24:31.690,1:24:32.690
[Baaulp laughs]

1:24:32.690,1:24:34.000
Trog: “Because I like it too much, and it’ll
distract me.”

1:24:34.000,1:24:36.639
Wayne: I was toolin’ around—I keep, for
some reason whenever

1:24:36.639,1:24:39.350
I’m talking about the unicycle I always
say, “tooling around,” I don’t know

1:24:39.350,1:24:40.350
why.

1:24:40.350,1:24:41.350
Trog: You’re turning into a fifty-year-old.

1:24:41.350,1:24:42.350
Wayne: The—

1:24:42.350,1:24:43.350
Trog: You’re aging.

1:24:43.350,1:24:44.350
Gir: It’s all these people—I don’t like
your new friends you

1:24:44.350,1:24:45.350
hang out with.

1:24:45.350,1:24:46.830
Wayne: [Laughs] I was tooling around in the
fuckin’-in the—

1:24:46.830,1:24:48.560
Log: I was knifin’ around.

1:24:48.560,1:24:50.969
Wayne: No, I don’t, I don’t have a single
friend on that forum.

1:24:50.969,1:24:54.239
I have-I have-there’s nice people, but I
wouldn’t call any of them my friends.

1:24:54.239,1:24:59.100
The uh, and yeah, I was toolin’ around in
this parking lot and Gir put on—Gir was

1:24:59.100,1:25:02.270
like, “Yo, I’m gonna put on fuckin’
Kirby Air Ride City Trial music,” and I

1:25:02.270,1:25:05.040
was
like, “Hell yeah,” fuckin’, I was ridin’

1:25:05.040,1:25:07.159
around listening to that shit, it was
awesome. And Gir was like, “I’m going

1:25:07.159,1:25:08.900
to get you killed by playing this music.”

1:25:08.900,1:25:09.900
[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

1:25:09.900,1:25:11.420
Wayne: Which is-which is fine, I’m already
skilled enough to

1:25:11.420,1:25:16.449
handle that thing at its top speed, which
like-I have a—it’s called a Gotway Mten3,

1:25:16.449,1:25:21.441
it is a-it’s the smallest electric unicycle.
Um, it’s not like bottom tier, like there

1:25:21.441,1:25:26.720
are some really shit old ones you can buy.
It’s pretty decent, its top speed is like—I

1:25:26.720,1:25:29.440
have the weaker version so it’s top speed
is like maybe

1:25:29.440,1:25:34.280
a little over sixteen miles per hour, um,
the—which on its own, when you’re just

1:25:34.280,1:25:39.219
standing on like a platform, that real-that
feels really fuckin’ fast. The wheels that

1:25:39.219,1:25:43.360
I’m gonna get in the coming months can go
like, thirty-five miles per hour which like,

1:25:43.360,1:25:48.070
I am both scared and can’t wait to experience
what the fuck that feels like.

1:25:48.070,1:25:53.530
Log: I think it’s irresponsible to have
like, a clown tool that can go that fast.

1:25:53.530,1:25:54.530
[Baaulp laughs]

1:25:54.530,1:25:56.080
Trog: But then how do clowns get to work?

1:25:56.080,1:25:58.630
Wayne: [Laughs] Bro, you know how fast a clown
car goes?

1:25:58.630,1:26:01.600
Log: They’re only allowed to drive that
in the circus arena.

1:26:01.600,1:26:03.070
[Baaulp laughs]

1:26:03.070,1:26:06.969
Wayne: Yo, first-first-first WayneRadioTV
electric unicycle

1:26:06.969,1:26:11.550
stream is I’m gonna-I’m gonna race four
clowns in a clown car with my electric

1:26:11.550,1:26:12.880
unicycle [laughs] the—

1:26:12.880,1:26:17.650
Baaulp: That should be the next uh-uh what
the fuck are

1:26:17.650,1:26:18.770
those movies called?

1:26:18.770,1:26:19.770
Log: Gremlins?

1:26:19.770,1:26:20.770
[Baaulp laughs]

1:26:20.770,1:26:23.260
Wayne, laughing: Gremlins. That should be
the next Gremlins

1:26:23.260,1:26:24.260
movie, man. A clown—

1:26:24.260,1:26:25.260
Gir: Don’t feed your clown after midnight.

1:26:25.260,1:26:30.920
Wayne: [Sighs] But yeah, that joyride was
really cool, um,

1:26:30.920,1:26:37.110
and then today I took it out and the like-this
thing I am ninety-nine percent certain

1:26:37.110,1:26:42.920
that I own the only one of these within like,
a hundred mile radius. Because

1:26:42.920,1:26:46.980
the looks I’ve got, and like the amount
of people who like, just point and me

1:26:46.980,1:26:50.480
and are like, “What the fuck is that?”
It happened so many times that I took it

1:26:50.480,1:26:54.050
out today. I had some dude on a motorcycle
like go out of his way to pull into the

1:26:54.050,1:26:55.380
parking lot I was in, drive up to me, and
be like, [in a southern accent] “What

1:26:55.380,1:26:56.380
the hell is that?”

1:26:56.380,1:26:58.100
Gir, in a southern accent: What the hell is
that thing?

1:26:58.100,1:27:00.429
Wayne: And I was like-and I was like-and I
like, I yelled at him over the-the roar of

1:27:00.429,1:27:02.869
the engine, “Electric unicycle!” “What?”
“Electric unicycle!” And he’s like,

1:27:02.869,1:27:07.139
“That’s pretty cool!” And I’m like,
“Yep!”

1:27:07.139,1:27:11.400
Trog: That-That’s what they say now, but
you’re going to get

1:27:11.400,1:27:15.330
into like a Frankenstein situation where people
start getting scared of you and

1:27:15.330,1:27:16.620
they-they like they think that you’re a
monster.

1:27:16.620,1:27:17.620
[Wayne laughs]

1:27:17.620,1:27:18.860
Trog: They’re going to chase you out of
town with torches

1:27:18.860,1:27:19.860
and pitchforks.

1:27:19.860,1:27:22.380
Wayne: I was thinking like, if I keep doing
late night

1:27:22.380,1:27:26.150
joyrides like, the cops are gonna know who
I am. I am going to be like a

1:27:26.150,1:27:29.570
regularly seen figure and like, I wonder if
I’m ever gonna get shit for it

1:27:29.570,1:27:33.369
eventually. The-like, I think it depends on
if I ever get complaints or

1:27:33.369,1:27:35.810
something like that. ‘Cause I’m not-I’m
not breaking any laws you fuckin’ cops!

1:27:35.810,1:27:36.810
Like—

1:27:36.810,1:27:38.730
Gir: No, but you look scary at night.

1:27:38.730,1:27:42.080
Wayne: I do look scary! I do look scary. I
do-I look cool

1:27:42.080,1:27:43.080
too, but—

1:27:43.080,1:27:44.810
Trog: Which is why you need to dress up like
a clown!

1:27:44.810,1:27:45.810
[Baaulp and Gir laugh]

1:27:45.810,1:27:49.060
Wayne: I would get so many more complaints
if I was

1:27:49.060,1:27:50.560
riding around on that thing in clown gear.

1:27:50.560,1:27:52.760
Trog: I’m not talking about like half-ass
clown gear, I’m

1:27:52.760,1:27:59.090
talking about full-ass parachute pants, giant
shoes, curly wig, red nose, face

1:27:59.090,1:28:00.090
paint clown.

1:28:00.090,1:28:02.170
Wayne: I think if I rode my electric unicycle
with clown

1:28:02.170,1:28:03.170
shoes I would die.

1:28:03.170,1:28:04.170
Trog: Then that’s your next step.

1:28:04.170,1:28:05.350
Wayne: I think that would get me killed. Like
[laughs]—

1:28:05.350,1:28:06.880
Trog: You have to learn.

1:28:06.880,1:28:10.750
Wayne: That’s-that’s day forty shit. I’m
on day five, leave

1:28:10.750,1:28:15.179
me alone. The uh-but like-I was walkin’
my dog, I walked past my neighbor who I’ve

1:28:15.179,1:28:18.110
never spoken to before, who like walked out
on their porch and was like, “I saw

1:28:18.110,1:28:22.320
you on your scooter thing! That was pretty
cool!” And I’m like, “Yo, thanks.”

1:28:22.320,1:28:24.630
Like I’m like, a little local celeb now.

1:28:24.630,1:28:26.270
[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

1:28:26.270,1:28:29.150
Wayne: It’s fuckin’-it’s fuckin’ hilarious.
And-and today,

1:28:29.150,1:28:33.270
I-I have a really funny little story. There’s
this one street that for whatever

1:28:33.270,1:28:37.010
reason, everyone who has a dog on it just
does not fence in their dog, and

1:28:37.010,1:28:40.460
every single one of the dogs is a little troublemaker,
like all of them. I’ve

1:28:40.460,1:28:43.670
seen so many just loose dogs on that street,
and it’s so hard to get them to go

1:28:43.670,1:28:46.820
back to where they need to. But, I rode down
that road this morning on my

1:28:46.820,1:28:51.020
electric unicycle, and I saw, just on the
sidewalk, just walking down perfectly

1:28:51.020,1:28:54.320
fine on the sidewalk, was just this little
Shih Tzu, totally unleashed, totally

1:28:54.320,1:28:57.940
unsupervised, and I was like, “Goddammit.”
And I was like-and as I pull up,

1:28:57.940,1:29:00.830
there’s this thought in my head like, “Should
I help it? Like should I go up? I

1:29:00.830,1:29:05.159
think I might know where this dog lives.”
And as I drive closer, I’m like, “Wait

1:29:05.159,1:29:10.320
a minute, I am the sheep dog for this dog.”
And I drive-I drive up to the dog,

1:29:10.320,1:29:12.969
and I literally start talking about it, like,
“Hey! Where are you supposed to

1:29:12.969,1:29:15.860
be?” And this little Shih Tzu like looks
up at me like, “What the fuck is that thing.

1:29:15.860,1:29:17.420
That’s a man on a wheel.”

1:29:17.420,1:29:18.420
[Baaulp laughs]

1:29:18.420,1:29:20.889
Wayne: And like it-it like-it immediately
like-it doesn’t

1:29:20.889,1:29:24.420
look like particularly like, terrified, but
it immediately just looks at me like,

1:29:24.420,1:29:28.020
turns tail and y’know that little dog trot
where they’re not like full-sprint

1:29:28.020,1:29:31.330
but they’re like, moving as fast as they
can without exerting too much energy?

1:29:31.330,1:29:36.350
Like, just trotting as fast as possible and
like, it like, I real-I remembered

1:29:36.350,1:29:39.080
where it probably lived and it was like running
around in the front yard and I

1:29:39.080,1:29:42.550
just kept zigzagging back and forth going
like, “You gotta go home! I’m not leavin’

1:29:42.550,1:29:45.821
till you go home!” And eventually it walked
around to the backyard and I saw it

1:29:45.821,1:29:49.530
go up to the porch and presumably through
their dog door. And I was like-I felt

1:29:49.530,1:29:53.480
so good I was like, “Yo, I just herded this
dog! I was a shepherd today! I’m

1:29:53.480,1:29:54.480
doing good with this!”

1:29:54.480,1:29:56.710
Wayne: And then when I went to the parking
lot later, the

1:29:56.710,1:29:59.780
same thing happened! Another dog got off its
leash, except this was a much

1:29:59.780,1:30:03.260
scarier place ‘cause the parking lot was
right next to a busy road. I didn’t

1:30:03.260,1:30:06.469
like, save that one myself but what I did
was I was like, I went up to them and

1:30:06.469,1:30:09.320
was like, “Are you good?” And what I did
was I like, I drove the unicycle like,

1:30:09.320,1:30:13.260
by the road and just kept going like up and
down the road as like a wall and the dog didn’t

1:30:13.260,1:30:20.690
approach me. So like, I am like-this like-weird,
high tech dog rescuer, I’m a public servant

1:30:20.690,1:30:21.690
now.

1:30:21.690,1:30:22.690
Log: Cyber-clown savior.

1:30:22.690,1:30:24.369
Trog: Hey, y’know, if the-if the streaming
thing

1:30:24.369,1:30:26.719
never—y’know, doesn’t pan out then…
you got an in.

1:30:26.719,1:30:28.030
Wayne, laughing: [Crosstalk] Cyber-clown savior.

1:30:28.030,1:30:30.670
Baaulp: Yeah, just uh, just never bring that
to like Boston,

1:30:30.670,1:30:34.340
‘cause then you’ll be known as like, ‘the
electric unicycle idiot,’ or

1:30:34.340,1:30:35.340
something.

1:30:35.340,1:30:39.350
Trog: [Laughs] The electric unicycle moron.

1:30:39.350,1:30:40.350
[Gir laughs]

1:30:40.350,1:30:43.940
Wayne: No matter what, it looks cool. The-the
like, there’s

1:30:43.940,1:30:47.460
like-there’s a huge community of people
riding these things in like, New York

1:30:47.460,1:30:49.871
City, I’m certain there’s a ton of people
in Boston that ride them—No, I know

1:30:49.871,1:30:53.500
there are, I watch a guy who’s from Boston.
The-I’m-you’ll probably see

1:30:53.500,1:30:55.760
someone one one day and like, it’ll probably
be the kind of thing where like,

1:30:55.760,1:30:57.909
you’re only seeing it now that someone’s
brought it up to you.

1:30:57.909,1:31:02.960
Gir: I will say, I live in a city that would
have something like that probably more than

1:31:02.960,1:31:07.969
a lot of other cities, never once in my life
have I seen somebody riding one of them.

1:31:07.969,1:31:11.219
Wayne: I’ve never seen one either, and like,
when I brought this up to my relatives who

1:31:11.219,1:31:15.400
were up on our trip, like, before they even
saw me get—before they even got to see me

1:31:15.400,1:31:19.330
ride it, they were like, “Yeah we just saw
a guy on one.” And I’m like, “No fuckin’

1:31:19.330,1:31:23.310
way!” I didn’t even know this thing existed
until a month ago! I didn’t know this was

1:31:23.310,1:31:24.640
a technology you could buy.

1:31:24.640,1:31:27.060
Baaulp: I’ve seen people ride all sorts
of things around the

1:31:27.060,1:31:31.219
city, and they always look uh, like they’re
wasting their time.

1:31:31.219,1:31:35.790
Trog: Yeah, as opposed to Baaulp who just
walks everywhere like a moron. Look at this

1:31:35.790,1:31:36.790
walkin’ idiot.

1:31:36.790,1:31:39.340
Wayne: What does that mean? This is a vehicle—this-this
is a

1:31:39.340,1:31:44.040
vehicle that is eco-friendly, that can take
you speeds at which at like-like

1:31:44.040,1:31:47.600
cruising speeds that would be good for a city.
Like, they’re amazing in city.

1:31:47.600,1:31:49.940
Baaulp: No, that’s just, uh—What, are
you too good to walk?

1:31:49.940,1:31:50.940
[Trog laughs]

1:31:50.940,1:31:53.610
Wayne: Yeah, it’s cool. It’s fun as fuck!

1:31:53.610,1:31:57.320
Trog: Baaulp is calling people out. If you
don’t walk

1:31:57.320,1:31:59.580
everywhere, Baaulp thinks you’re just a
dumb idiot.

1:31:59.580,1:32:00.920
[Baaulp makes a sound of agreement]

1:32:00.920,1:32:04.150
Wayne: The next steps on my electric unicycle
journey, I

1:32:04.150,1:32:07.560
gotta-I gotta-I gotta learn—I gotta practice
driving on like slightly busier

1:32:07.560,1:32:11.411
roads. Like tomorrow I’m thinking I’m
gonna try to go get coffee on it, um, the

1:32:11.411,1:32:17.340
uh, which’ll be a lotta fun. I gotta learn
how to ride backwards, um, y’know,

1:32:17.340,1:32:18.630
like that’s necessary for juggling.

1:32:18.630,1:32:19.630
[Baaulp laughs]

1:32:19.630,1:32:20.630
Trog: Yes, very important.

1:32:20.630,1:32:24.320
Wayne: Yeah, that’s so-that so far, I have
fallen off this thing, but I always end up

1:32:24.320,1:32:27.619
stumbling. I’ve never landed on my ass or
like my—I wear a ton of gear but I’ve

1:32:27.619,1:32:32.650
like yet to actually hurt myself. Uh, usually
what happens is like I’ll jump off and the

1:32:32.650,1:32:36.610
wheel will take a bigger hit than me. But
that little thing, it’s a trooper. It has

1:32:36.610,1:32:41.230
taken so much damage and it’s like, perfectly
fine. It’s all cosmetic damage. Um, the

1:32:41.230,1:32:48.159
uh, and then uh, the like final frontier is
like, jumping. I mean if you-if you modify

1:32:48.159,1:32:49.159
them by—

1:32:49.159,1:32:50.340
Trog: [Crosstalk] How do you jump?

1:32:50.340,1:32:53.380
Wayne: —So the-like—What you do is—They
call ‘em Kuji Pads,

1:32:53.380,1:32:56.720
‘cause there’s a guy on YouTube called
Kuji Rolls who like, invented them,

1:32:56.720,1:33:00.360
essentially. What they are is like-they’re
a-they’re like a thick layer of

1:33:00.360,1:33:05.080
neoprene padding that you put on the wheel,
right above like—not-not above your

1:33:05.080,1:33:08.150
toes but like the center of your foot, right
above that, and what it does is

1:33:08.150,1:33:11.460
like—it lets you get a grip on the wheel
that you wouldn’t otherwise have. So

1:33:11.460,1:33:16.420
like, you grip it, you-you ju—you buckle
your knees and you jump and you grab

1:33:16.420,1:33:19.670
that pad and you go up in the air and you
take the wheel with you. If you jump

1:33:19.670,1:33:23.670
off of it like, without a modded wheel, you
will just go up and your wheel will

1:33:23.670,1:33:27.389
keep going without you, and you will eat shit
and your wheel will explode.

1:33:27.389,1:33:29.040
Gir, laughing: Yeah, and you’ll die.

1:33:29.040,1:33:32.170
Wayne: But like, when you-when you do that,
it is such a

1:33:32.170,1:33:35.060
neat skill to have because it means that like,
if you want to like transition

1:33:35.060,1:33:38.170
from riding in the bike lane to riding on
the sidewalk, you don’t have to stop

1:33:38.170,1:33:41.130
and like, lift up the wheel, which is like
what I would have to do now unless

1:33:41.130,1:33:45.230
there’s a ramp, which is what I’ve been
using for the most part. Um, but like,

1:33:45.230,1:33:49.020
they’re doing crazy shit. The videos in
which he describes how to jump he’s like

1:33:49.020,1:33:54.610
jumping over like small manmade moats—It’s
like crazy how much distance they’re

1:33:54.610,1:33:59.360
getting. And the final thing that I will never,
ever do is riding down stairs.

1:33:59.360,1:34:02.159
That’s horrifying and I will be fine not
partaking.

1:34:02.159,1:34:04.800
Gir: Yeah that’s like asking for your neck
to be broken.

1:34:04.800,1:34:07.650
Wayne: Yeah, the—I’ve never seen anyone
fall doing it, but

1:34:07.650,1:34:10.930
that’s ‘cause the people who do it are
experts, but that’s just like—No, I’ll

1:34:10.930,1:34:13.530
just-I’ll just stop and go down the stairs.
I think I’m good.

1:34:13.530,1:34:17.150
Gir: Yeah, I was going to say, to round out
this-this… vehicle

1:34:17.150,1:34:21.500
talk, I will say one last addition before
we move onto the questions. I’ve been

1:34:21.500,1:34:26.610
thinking about just getting like-like a Razor.
Like a regular ass, basic,

1:34:26.610,1:34:28.699
non-motorized Razor scooter just to facilitate—

1:34:28.699,1:34:29.699
Trog: Hell yeah.

1:34:29.699,1:34:32.440
Gir: —going down to the corner store, ‘cause
for the next

1:34:32.440,1:34:35.170
two months I can’t renew my license.

1:34:35.170,1:34:39.480
Trog: Now is a Razor scooter—‘Cause whenever
I think about using

1:34:39.480,1:34:42.600
a scooter, it’s not really efficient in
terms of like—

1:34:42.600,1:34:44.880
Wayne: It’s not even remotely efficient.

1:34:44.880,1:34:48.659
Trog: —force exerted to like distance traveled
I feel like

1:34:48.659,1:34:50.880
is worse than just about any option.

1:34:50.880,1:34:54.429
Gir: No, distance traveled here is… the
distance I’m talking

1:34:54.429,1:35:00.420
about is far enough that walking sucks, but
not so far that it would be more exhausting

1:35:00.420,1:35:01.420
to use it.

1:35:01.420,1:35:02.489
Trog: May I make a suggestion?

1:35:02.489,1:35:03.659
Gir: No.

1:35:03.659,1:35:07.270
Wayne: My electric unicycle kick like, this-this-this
thing

1:35:07.270,1:35:10.400
that I’m doing, part of the reason why I’m
doing it is because I’ve always had

1:35:10.400,1:35:14.060
this desire to know how to rollerblade, but
rollerblades fuck me up more than

1:35:14.060,1:35:17.380
this electric unicycle thing even though the
electric unicycle is technically way

1:35:17.380,1:35:21.920
more dangerous. I—There’s-there’s a
video I saw a while back that like-that put

1:35:21.920,1:35:24.850
this bug in my brain like, “Man, one day
you need to get really good at

1:35:24.850,1:35:27.940
rollerblading,” where it was like, someone
rollerblading to literal Jet Set

1:35:27.940,1:35:31.790
Radio music and they jump on a fucking rail
and start grinding and I was like, “Holy

1:35:31.790,1:35:36.190
shit! That would be so cool to be like, a
master at that.” But like, I hate the

1:35:36.190,1:35:39.290
idea of not being able to just like, get rid
of the wheels off your feet and

1:35:39.290,1:35:43.860
just start walking, like, if you’re on a
rollerblade and like, something goes wrong,

1:35:43.860,1:35:47.040
your only option is to eat shit. You can’t
just like, save yourself.

1:35:47.040,1:35:51.030
Gir: And that-that’s what I was gonna bring
up. My—The route-the

1:35:51.030,1:35:56.130
path that I would be taking is exclusively
next to a busy road with a sidewalk

1:35:56.130,1:36:01.380
that is barely wider than I am. So, uh, eating
shit in that situation would be

1:36:01.380,1:36:02.380
uh, lethal.

1:36:02.380,1:36:03.380
Trog: Now—

1:36:03.380,1:36:06.630
Gir: A scooter reduces that immensely, even
more than if I

1:36:06.630,1:36:07.630
were to have a skateboard.

1:36:07.630,1:36:10.900
Trog: Now may I make a-now may I make an observation?
Uh—

1:36:10.900,1:36:11.900
Gir: Sure.

1:36:11.900,1:36:17.070
Trog, cracking up: I think you—the visual
of you riding a

1:36:17.070,1:36:22.210
child’s Razor scooter down to the corner
store as a full grown adult next to a

1:36:22.210,1:36:23.210
busy street—

1:36:23.210,1:36:24.210
Wayne, laughing: [Crosstalk] I can see—yeah—

1:36:24.210,1:36:25.699
Trog: —is probably the funniest thing I’ve
thought of in the

1:36:25.699,1:36:27.360
last hour and a half of recording.

1:36:27.360,1:36:30.760
Wayne: I don’t know if-I don’t know if
they make unmotorized

1:36:30.760,1:36:31.760
Razor scooters—

1:36:31.760,1:36:32.760
Trog, laughing: [Crosstalk] For adults.

1:36:32.760,1:36:34.290
Wayne: That like-that like are—Yeah, I don’t
think they make

1:36:34.290,1:36:35.290
those for adults.

1:36:35.290,1:36:36.290
[Trog laughs]

1:36:36.290,1:36:38.679
Wayne: I think you can only get an electric
scooter. Which

1:36:38.679,1:36:39.900
like-why not an electric scooter?

1:36:39.900,1:36:40.900
Gir: Those’re expensive.

1:36:40.900,1:36:41.969
Wayne: Like that-those are-those are cool.

1:36:41.969,1:36:45.619
Trog: Oh, Razor scooters for Tyler who’s
like in eighth grade!

1:36:45.619,1:36:46.619
[Wayne laughs]

1:36:46.619,1:36:48.280
Gir: Tyler won’t let me borrow his!

1:36:48.280,1:36:49.460
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

1:36:49.460,1:36:51.450
Baaulp: They’re-they’re expensive because
they’re adult sized,

1:36:51.450,1:36:52.450
Gir.

1:36:52.450,1:36:53.450
Gir: No, they’re not.

1:36:53.450,1:36:54.450
Trog: That is true.

1:36:54.450,1:36:55.450
Wayne: Mhmm.

1:36:55.450,1:36:57.310
Gir: They’re the exact same size I work
with a guy who had

1:36:57.310,1:36:58.310
one! It’s the exact same size…

1:36:58.310,1:37:01.081
Trog: [Crosstalk] I am all for Gir purchasing
a child’s scooter

1:37:01.081,1:37:03.590
and riding it to the corner store.

1:37:03.590,1:37:04.590
Gir: Whatever!

1:37:04.590,1:37:07.320
Wayne: I will-honestly, I’m gonna-I’m
gonna shill the EUCs

1:37:07.320,1:37:10.640
like, for the rest of my life to you guys,
probably. Like, you probably-you—Here’s

1:37:10.640,1:37:14.380
the thing, here’s the thing. Like, let’s
say I end up-we end up all moving to a

1:37:14.380,1:37:16.780
place where we’re pretty close together,
I’ll have that thing, you’ll be able

1:37:16.780,1:37:20.160
to see it, and I will want some of you to
try it, because it is like—

1:37:20.160,1:37:22.930
Gir: I’m on Razor’s website right now,
and here’s-they

1:37:22.930,1:37:24.260
filter—They filter ages—

1:37:24.260,1:37:25.260
[Wayne laughs]

1:37:25.260,1:37:28.420
Gir: Kids five to seven, and then they have
eight through

1:37:28.420,1:37:29.420
twelve—

1:37:29.420,1:37:30.420
[Baaulp laughs]

1:37:30.420,1:37:31.420
Wayne, laughing: Perfect!

1:37:31.420,1:37:32.679
Gir: —And then one specifically labeled
teens and adults.

1:37:32.679,1:37:33.679
[Wayne laughs]

1:37:33.679,1:37:34.679
Trog: Uh-huh.

1:37:34.679,1:37:35.679
Gir: Alright?

1:37:35.679,1:37:37.960
Trog: Like I said, I am all for this excursion,
I think you

1:37:37.960,1:37:38.960
should do it.

1:37:38.960,1:37:43.011
Gir: I’ll get one with the big wheels uh,
so I can put—I can

1:37:43.011,1:37:45.800
attach a cart on it so it sounds like it has
a motor.

1:37:45.800,1:37:48.900
Trog: Oh, yeah. [Laughs] That’ll be so much
fun.

1:37:48.900,1:37:49.900
[Gir laughs]

1:37:49.900,1:37:52.590
Trog: Can we all pick just like, a weird fucked
up mode of

1:37:52.590,1:37:58.101
transportation and-and all decide like, Wayne
can have-Wayne can have his

1:37:58.101,1:37:59.101
electric unicycle—

1:37:59.101,1:38:00.101
Wayne: [Crosstalk] We have the funniest gang.

1:38:00.101,1:38:04.940
Trog: —Gir can have a Razor scooter, I want
to ride two

1:38:04.940,1:38:09.969
hoverboards at the same time, but not one
on each foot, I want one for my feet

1:38:09.969,1:38:11.310
and one for my hands.

1:38:11.310,1:38:12.310
[Baaulp laughs]

1:38:12.310,1:38:16.469
Trog: So I’m like on all fours riding these
two fuckin’—I’m

1:38:16.469,1:38:17.860
like a dog on wheels.

1:38:17.860,1:38:20.820
Wayne: You are asking like—the injury you’re
gonna get there

1:38:20.820,1:38:24.770
is like, you’re gonna lose your balls, man.
Like, you’re gonna like, fall and

1:38:24.770,1:38:28.429
like it’s gonna stretch you out and you’re
gonna land balls first on the ground—

1:38:28.429,1:38:31.540
Baaulp: I want-I want to be like that guy
from Twisted Metal

1:38:31.540,1:38:33.590
where I’m between two giant tires [laughs]—

1:38:33.590,1:38:34.590
Trog: Yeah.

1:38:34.590,1:38:37.320
Wayne: Yes! Bro, no, for real. If there was
a community like

1:38:37.320,1:38:42.840
the EUC community but for being Axel or whatever
his name was from fuckin’

1:38:42.840,1:38:45.600
Twisted Metal, I would-I’d be on that. I’d
would be on that.

1:38:45.600,1:38:46.600
Trog: [Unintelligible crosstalk]

1:38:46.600,1:38:50.810
Log: Um, I just had like a genius idea that
I can’t execute ‘cause

1:38:50.810,1:38:54.080
I’m not an engineer. Uh, electric pole vault.

1:38:54.080,1:38:55.080
Gir, laughing: How—what?

1:38:55.080,1:38:56.090
Trog: What is that? How does that work?

1:38:56.090,1:38:57.090
Wayne: How? Wha—Explain.

1:38:57.090,1:39:01.230
Log: Alright, Okay, so like inste—So you
know pole? Um, at

1:39:01.230,1:39:05.890
one end you have a little wedge kind of thing
with a motor in it, right? So you-you

1:39:05.890,1:39:11.200
wedge that end into something, you activate
the motor and it pole vaults for

1:39:11.200,1:39:12.200
you.

1:39:12.200,1:39:13.470
Gir: That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever
heard.

1:39:13.470,1:39:16.270
Wayne: But—Okay, okay, so how is that-how
is that a method

1:39:16.270,1:39:20.970
of transportation beyond just a single jump?
Like, can you-would you be able to

1:39:20.970,1:39:21.970
continue?

1:39:21.970,1:39:22.970
Log: [Crosstalk] You can continue-you can
continue and just

1:39:22.970,1:39:23.970
replace it.

1:39:23.970,1:39:24.970
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:39:24.970,1:39:25.970
Gir, laughing: This is the dumbest thing!

1:39:25.970,1:39:26.970
Wayne: Hold on, re-describe this to me. I
need to—

1:39:26.970,1:39:30.000
Baaulp: You’re basically just pole vaulting
like, over and

1:39:30.000,1:39:31.000
over again!

1:39:31.000,1:39:34.381
Log: Yeah, and that’s kind of—but imagine
this, like, you

1:39:34.381,1:39:37.780
can go—If it’s-if it’s an electric pole
vault then you can pole vault up.

1:39:37.780,1:39:38.780
[Baaulp laughs]

1:39:38.780,1:39:42.510
Trog: You can pole vault up without electricity,
though,

1:39:42.510,1:39:44.820
like the pole vault is used for the…

1:39:44.820,1:39:46.900
Wayne: The first thing you do is go up!

1:39:46.900,1:39:50.980
Gir: You’ve essentially described something
that’s as-as equally

1:39:50.980,1:39:52.540
like, pointless as electric stilts.

1:39:52.540,1:39:55.420
Trog: Electric stilts would be pretty fucking
sick, though.

1:39:55.420,1:39:57.080
I would totally use electric stilts.

1:39:57.080,1:39:59.960
Log: We were-we were asked to describe fucked
up means of

1:39:59.960,1:40:01.660
transportation, so, I-I don’t—

1:40:01.660,1:40:03.520
Gir: Well it-it still has to transport you,
though! [Laughs]

1:40:03.520,1:40:07.380
Log: It takes you from one place to another,
and I think it’s

1:40:07.380,1:40:11.090
fucked up. So, I think-I think that you should-you
should perish.

1:40:11.090,1:40:12.530
[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

1:40:12.530,1:40:20.949
Wayne: I feel like the-the visual-the visual
of this gang of people is like, you—Like,

1:40:20.949,1:40:26.860
my-my thing is like weird, but it is-but it’s
very practical. I would be just like, speeding

1:40:26.860,1:40:31.460
up way ahead of you guys then turning back
and seeing like, Gir like pushing off the

1:40:31.460,1:40:36.880
ground, Trog on the ground like, eating gravel
as he like rumbles down the road, like, oh

1:40:36.880,1:40:37.880
man.

1:40:37.880,1:40:38.880
[Gir laughs]

1:40:38.880,1:40:39.880
Trog: [Crosstalk] I don’t think I’m describing
mine good

1:40:39.880,1:40:40.880
enough.

1:40:40.880,1:40:42.480
Log: Hey, we’re basically creating the vehicles
for a Mario

1:40:42.480,1:40:43.820
Party battle mini-game.

1:40:43.820,1:40:44.820
[Wayne laughs]

1:40:44.820,1:40:47.842
Trog: Yeah, we’re like the coolest RPG team,
like we-like we

1:40:47.842,1:40:50.710
are the RPG characters. We all have our own
thing.

1:40:50.710,1:40:55.060
Baaulp: Also, I’m a little insulted because
Axel would be way faster than your electric

1:40:55.060,1:40:56.060
unicycle, the only—

1:40:56.060,1:40:57.989
Wayne: Actually, that’s true. No, you’d
have the-you’d have

1:40:57.989,1:40:59.790
the speed of a car, is the thing, like—

1:40:59.790,1:41:04.489
Baaulp: The only drawback is if I make any
mistakes the wheels keep going and my hands

1:41:04.489,1:41:05.540
get ripped off.

1:41:05.540,1:41:07.270
[Baaulp, Gir, and Trog laugh]

1:41:07.270,1:41:09.420
Wayne: Yeah, the thing is that like, there’s-there’s
that

1:41:09.420,1:41:12.800
downside, and also I believe there’s the-the
other downside that I believe that

1:41:12.800,1:41:17.360
character in lore is described as in excruciating
pain at all times because

1:41:17.360,1:41:18.540
that is a torture device.

1:41:18.540,1:41:19.540
[Baaulp laughs]

1:41:19.540,1:41:21.650
Trog: Well, that’s the price you gotta pay.
I wanna change

1:41:21.650,1:41:26.690
mine from the double hoverboard—I have posted
an image in the chat, the-the people

1:41:26.690,1:41:30.540
listening to this can’t see this, so I’m
going to try and describe this—Imagine

1:41:30.540,1:41:36.860
if your body was a giant rollerblade, just
covered in wheels from top to bottom,

1:41:36.860,1:41:40.320
that’s what I want to be. I just want to
be able to like, start running and

1:41:40.320,1:41:44.130
fall down and it doesn’t matter how I fall
because there will be wheels

1:41:44.130,1:41:45.630
underneath me that keep me going.

1:41:45.630,1:41:49.400
Wayne: Oh, yeah! I see what-like, that’s
a legit thing, though.

1:41:49.400,1:41:50.400
Like what is that?

1:41:50.400,1:41:51.400
Gir: That actually is pretty cool.

1:41:51.400,1:41:52.400
Trog: I don’t know.

1:41:52.400,1:41:53.400
Wayne: What do they call that?

1:41:53.400,1:41:54.400
Baaulp: There’s like a rollerblade suit.

1:41:54.400,1:41:57.679
Trog: Yeah. I want to be the rollerblade suit
guy, but I want it to be motorized so I just

1:41:57.679,1:41:59.239
like, I’m like a-I’m like a fuckin’
Transformer—

1:41:59.239,1:42:00.320
Wayne: That’d be dope.

1:42:00.320,1:42:02.119
Trog: —I curl up and roll out.

1:42:02.119,1:42:05.230
Wayne: That’s something that like, in a
Fast and Furious

1:42:05.230,1:42:07.429
movie, Vin Diesel would be attacked by when
he doesn’t have his car.

1:42:07.429,1:42:08.429
[Baaulp laughs]

1:42:08.429,1:42:09.929
Trog: Yeah, there’s like a group-there’s
like a squad of

1:42:09.929,1:42:12.650
these dudes that have like, miniguns on their
backs.

1:42:12.650,1:42:13.650
[Wayne laughs]

1:42:13.650,1:42:15.241
Gir: Y’know, I thought about it more-I’ve
sat and thought

1:42:15.241,1:42:20.250
about it, I think electric stilts would be
more like pneumatic stilts, where you

1:42:20.250,1:42:21.710
can like change your height at will.

1:42:21.710,1:42:22.970
Trog: That’d be cool. I’d be down.

1:42:22.970,1:42:24.040
Gir: That actually would be pretty practical,
yeah. It’s

1:42:24.040,1:42:28.770
like, “Oh, I gotta get over this really
tall fence, let me just shrink one leg

1:42:28.770,1:42:30.599
and extend the other, step right over.”

1:42:30.599,1:42:31.599
[Trog laughs]

1:42:31.599,1:42:34.139
Wayne: I’ve always wanted to try those like-like
we saw a

1:42:34.139,1:42:38.659
bunch of like, cosplayers using these when
we went to PAX East, they’re like pogo

1:42:38.659,1:42:40.120
stick stilts that like—

1:42:40.120,1:42:41.780
Gir: [Crosstalk] Yeah. Yeah, those are [unintelligible].

1:42:41.780,1:42:43.880
Wayne: —have like the bend of an animal’s
hindlegs, like-those

1:42:43.880,1:42:48.390
things look fun. Those things look like—I
would love to try those. They seem

1:42:48.390,1:42:52.699
like, not like—they’re thick, they’re
not like stilts which are literally just

1:42:52.699,1:42:56.090
like sticks, they look like they’re actually
like, pretty feasible to get on

1:42:56.090,1:42:58.340
and like, maneuver yourself around and bounce
around.

1:42:58.340,1:43:01.650
Gir: They’re what some prosthetics are—are
just those.

1:43:01.650,1:43:05.969
Trog: Yeah. I am looking at Amazon for jumping
stilts right

1:43:05.969,1:43:09.750
now, I think this is gonna be my new thing
that I get into, is these fucking

1:43:09.750,1:43:10.750
jumping stilts.

1:43:10.750,1:43:14.160
Wayne: No, no, if we-if we are-if we are rolling
around, if

1:43:14.160,1:43:17.560
we’re rolling around the streets of Texas
I’m on my EUC, you’re on your stilts,

1:43:17.560,1:43:18.560
Gir’s on his Razor scooter—

1:43:18.560,1:43:20.781
Trog: The thing is these stilts don’t make
you fast, I would

1:43:20.781,1:43:24.940
be slower on these, like this would be like—this
is essentially me like, riding

1:43:24.940,1:43:27.610
a pogo stick while you’re on a-like, in
a vehicle.

1:43:27.610,1:43:28.610
[Wayne laughs]

1:43:28.610,1:43:31.369
Gir: Can I say I chose this-this mode of transportation
to

1:43:31.369,1:43:36.909
get me like, five hundred feet away from my
house. I’m not about to roll around

1:43:36.909,1:43:38.330
town on this fuckin’ thing.

1:43:38.330,1:43:40.889
Trog: You should get a pogo stick. God, pogo
sticks are

1:43:40.889,1:43:41.889
expensive!

1:43:41.889,1:43:42.889
Wayne: Lame, lame!

1:43:42.889,1:43:45.159
Trog: This pogo stick is a hundred and fifty
dollars! And it’s

1:43:45.159,1:43:56.350
only for fourteen-year olds!

1:43:56.350,1:44:10.650
Baaulp: Sloane asks, “Podcast question—What
are each of your

1:44:10.650,1:44:15.360
favorite videos on YouTube that have under
one thousand views? Love, Sloane.”

1:44:15.360,1:44:16.360
Trog: Hmmm…

1:44:16.360,1:44:20.270
Wayne: Y’know, my memory’s horrible, but
I’m gonna go look in my playlist that is

1:44:20.270,1:44:21.980
specifically for stuff like this.

1:44:21.980,1:44:26.179
Baaulp: Yeah. Uh, new favorite-new favorite,
Buff dog. Um, that’s

1:44:26.179,1:44:28.300
a new-yeah, that’s a new one.

1:44:28.300,1:44:29.300
Trog: [Laughs] Buff dog.

1:44:29.300,1:44:32.000
Baaulp: It’s just a—this like, ten second
video of this buff Pitbull.

1:44:32.000,1:44:34.860
Wayne: Does that have less than a thousand
views?

1:44:34.860,1:44:36.050
Baaulp: Uh, let me check.

1:44:36.050,1:44:37.949
Wayne: You gotta-you gotta meet that criteria,
man.

1:44:37.949,1:44:41.159
Baaulp: For—At the time of this recording,
four hundred and

1:44:41.159,1:44:46.889
eighty-two views. It is a buff dog, and it
has some like, bass boosted Old MacDonald

1:44:46.889,1:44:50.699
like, Old MacDonald like, music over it.

1:44:50.699,1:44:54.810
Trog: Old MacDonald music, also known as the
song, Old MacDonald.

1:44:54.810,1:44:55.810
[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

1:44:55.810,1:44:59.540
Gir: This is a hard one, ‘cause most of
my favorite videos that

1:44:59.540,1:45:04.480
were under a thousand like, got popular after-after
the fact. So.

1:45:04.480,1:45:07.740
Trog: Yeah, y’know, I was looking for one,
and I was like, “Oh,

1:45:07.740,1:45:12.000
I know exactly which one I’d pick,” but
Green Goblin Sound Effects has like,

1:45:12.000,1:45:13.000
four thousand views.

1:45:13.000,1:45:16.560
Gir: Yeah, okay, that was I was gonna say,
is like, my pick-my

1:45:16.560,1:45:19.941
pick and, we’re going to have to ignore
that criteria because a lot of the time

1:45:19.941,1:45:21.949
these things just go over, but—

1:45:21.949,1:45:22.949
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:45:22.949,1:45:25.840
Gir: —my pick, three-point-five thousand
views after nine

1:45:25.840,1:45:28.909
years, ‘Ice Cube – “It Was a Good Day”
[HD] *extended version*.’

1:45:28.909,1:45:30.640
Trog: That’s a pretty good one.

1:45:30.640,1:45:36.600
Wayne: Guys. Guess what video has under a
thousand views. ‘zozo go bo ba bo ba.’

1:45:36.600,1:45:40.110
Trog: No, I don’t-that video doesn’t exist,
you are making

1:45:40.110,1:45:41.110
it up.

1:45:41.110,1:45:42.790
Wayne: It’s fuckin’ real! I’m lo-I’m
lookin’ at it!

1:45:42.790,1:45:43.800
Trog: No, it’s not.

1:45:43.800,1:45:44.800
[Baaulp laughs]

1:45:44.800,1:45:48.510
Trog: I don’t know what you’re looking
at, it’s not a real

1:45:48.510,1:45:49.510
video.

1:45:49.510,1:45:54.349
Wayne: Look! “Make a zombie go boom, boom,
boom, boom, boom.”

1:45:54.349,1:45:57.170
Trog: [Sighs] You can only watch that video
like, a hundred

1:45:57.170,1:46:00.210
more times and then it no longer qualifies
for this category.

1:46:00.210,1:46:03.429
Wayne: [Laughs] I know, it’s about to slip
out.

1:46:03.429,1:46:04.429
[Gir laughs]

1:46:04.429,1:46:07.040
Wayne: Ahhhh, you know what-a video that just
slipped out of

1:46:07.040,1:46:10.430
the ‘under one thousand views,’ chat,
is uh, “I stay committed while you

1:46:10.430,1:46:13.730
motherfuckers babysittin’,” that one has
over a thousand views, so that doesn’t

1:46:13.730,1:46:14.830
fall under the category here.

1:46:14.830,1:46:17.900
Trog: 'vxcv' has like, seven-seven thousand
views, like, I can’t

1:46:17.900,1:46:21.679
believe that 'vxcv' has [laughs] seven thousand
views.

1:46:21.679,1:46:23.590
Wayne: Yeah. 'vxcv'’s famous.

1:46:23.590,1:46:29.210
Log: Yeah, I’m-I’m really surprised 'this
video don't wach' has like, seven thousand.

1:46:29.210,1:46:32.699
Trog: No way. Really? All those people wachin’!

1:46:32.699,1:46:34.270
Wayne: That might be because of us.

1:46:34.270,1:46:35.449
Log: Yeah, maybe [laughs].

1:46:35.449,1:46:38.400
Trog: It’s probably because of us, nobody
else knew that fucking

1:46:38.400,1:46:39.800
video existed before we brought it up.

1:46:39.800,1:46:42.110
Gir: See, we do this to ourselves! Because
I feel like we find

1:46:42.110,1:46:45.150
videos that are like that, but then we show
other people and ruin it!

1:46:45.150,1:46:46.969
Trog: Yeah, hey, this sounds like a-this sounds
like

1:46:46.969,1:46:49.760
entrapment, you’re trying to get us to say
these so you can go watch ‘em and

1:46:49.760,1:46:51.190
put ‘em out of the category.

1:46:51.190,1:46:52.190
Gir: Yeah!

1:46:52.190,1:46:53.550
Wayne: It won’t r-it doesn’t ruin them,
though!

1:46:53.550,1:46:55.690
Trog: No, it doesn’t ruin them, I’m just
sayin’.

1:46:55.690,1:46:58.560
Wayne: Unless it becomes some big meme and
it’s blown out of

1:46:58.560,1:47:03.380
proportion, it’s fine. Like, how about around
a thousand. Like, just-just

1:47:03.380,1:47:04.380
like a very low view—

1:47:04.380,1:47:08.020
Log: I actually have a couple of killers that
are low view—well,

1:47:08.020,1:47:09.020
two specifically.

1:47:09.020,1:47:10.020
Wayne: Killers.

1:47:10.020,1:47:13.739
Log: ‘Alien Rap,’ and ‘Sad Song Featuring
Ging Gungus.’

1:47:13.739,1:47:15.500
Baaulp, laughing: Oh, yeah!

1:47:15.500,1:47:17.710
Gir, singing: “My dog died!”

1:47:17.710,1:47:21.179
Wayne: Wait is-is Alien Rap the one that’s
like-the one that’s

1:47:21.179,1:47:23.510
like, “Evoke the dark arts, the man is heap-sauce,”
that one?

1:47:23.510,1:47:27.230
Log: No, I can’t-I don’t-I don’t even
know how to find that,

1:47:27.230,1:47:31.770
Alien Rap is like the negative—the video
of the kid in negative like whisper

1:47:31.770,1:47:34.920
rapping with uh, like, a generic rock riff
playing over it.

1:47:34.920,1:47:36.550
Trog: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:47:36.550,1:47:40.730
Wayne: So the one that I was thinking about,
I actually have reuploaded on one of my channels

1:47:40.730,1:47:44.880
somewhere, where it was like a rap someone
made where the lyrics were just like, fucking

1:47:44.880,1:47:51.230
bizarre, I-the-the-the lyrics were like, “Spaceman,
evasive action, you better watch out, they’re

1:47:51.230,1:47:57.080
comin’ for ‘ya, they got a lot of fraction,”
And like, but the-the final-the final line-the

1:47:57.080,1:48:02.090
final bar is, “Mastered the Dark Arts, the
man is heap-sauce.” I’ll never forget

1:48:02.090,1:48:03.090
that last one.

1:48:03.090,1:48:06.070
Gir: I have to revise my answer because the
closest thing a

1:48:06.070,1:48:11.310
thousand, at 1.4K, and Holly will back me
up on this, is ‘Vegeta loves

1:48:11.310,1:48:12.750
a hot sauce feet.’

1:48:12.750,1:48:13.750
Trog: Oh, god.

1:48:13.750,1:48:16.460
Gir: That fucking cracks me up so fuckin’
bad.

1:48:16.460,1:48:18.640
Wayne: Wait, what is that? That sounds familiar.

1:48:18.640,1:48:21.151
Gir: It’s just like-like footage of Vegeta
with like that

1:48:21.151,1:48:24.429
fucked up weird fetish audio in the background,
like, “Oh, yeah, hot sauce on

1:48:24.429,1:48:25.429
these fuckin’ southern feet.”

1:48:25.429,1:48:27.159
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

1:48:27.159,1:48:30.780
Gir: And it gets me and Holly every fuckin’
time.

1:48:30.780,1:48:34.880
Baaulp: Oh damn, Zabz has like, hundred thousand
views, well

1:48:34.880,1:48:35.880
shit.

1:48:35.880,1:48:38.030
Wayne: Yeah, that video has some significance
that we don’t

1:48:38.030,1:48:39.030
understand.

1:48:39.030,1:48:40.090
Baaulp: It’s not for us.

1:48:40.090,1:48:43.380
Wayne: Actually no, maybe it-all the-all the
comments are… I-I

1:48:43.380,1:48:47.430
don’t know. ‘Cause some of the comments
are just a million emojis, which is pretty

1:48:47.430,1:48:48.840
typical of something like that.

1:48:48.840,1:48:53.650
Trog: ‘MyZaza’ has eleven thousand views.
Even ‘MyZaza’ isn’t safe.

1:48:53.650,1:48:58.389
Log: There’s one I can think of that, um,
did have around a

1:48:58.389,1:49:04.490
thousand views at one point but, due to our
meddling, shot way, way above that.

1:49:04.490,1:49:06.140
It’s uh, ‘Banjo Gyro!.’

1:49:06.140,1:49:10.260
Trog: ‘Banjo Gyro!’ was fuckin’ nothing
before we found it.

1:49:10.260,1:49:14.150
Log: Kevin—Yeah, Kevin, one of the moderators
in the

1:49:14.150,1:49:18.540
Discord, uh, Kevin-Kevin typed ‘Gyro’
into YouTube and found a—like a-like

1:49:18.540,1:49:25.659
a-just a CGI animation like, short film, called
‘Banjo Gyro!’, it’s the-like,

1:49:25.659,1:49:28.170
most absurd shit I’ve ever seen.

1:49:28.170,1:49:32.449
Wayne: It’s amazing. It’s incredible.
It’s so-it is fuckin’

1:49:32.449,1:49:36.510
awesome, and like, I feel like it has influenced
us in a lot of ways over the

1:49:36.510,1:49:41.750
years—The amazing aesthetic, just some of
the-some of the most memorable,

1:49:41.750,1:49:44.510
iconic—I feel like I can remember like-I
think my favorite part of ‘Banjo

1:49:44.510,1:49:45.510
Gyro’—sound design.

1:49:45.510,1:49:46.510
Baaulp: Yes, yes.

1:49:46.510,1:49:48.630
Wayne: Like I feel like I can remember every
weird little synth

1:49:48.630,1:49:52.220
noise like-like—[Wayne makes a sound similar
to a meow, followed by a low, repetitive noise].

1:49:52.220,1:49:57.750
Like, whenever someone moves, it’s not footsteps,
it’s like synth bubbling and like, just—It’s

1:49:57.750,1:50:03.770
so good. Every-every single noise sounds like
it could be used for like an alien abducting

1:50:03.770,1:50:05.840
you, like, it’s—Ahhh, it’s so good.

1:50:05.840,1:50:06.840
[Trog laughs]

1:50:06.840,1:50:09.130
Log: Yeah, it’s fantastic. So that has a
couple hundred

1:50:09.130,1:50:12.280
thousand views now, but it’s still fantastic,
so check it out.

1:50:12.280,1:50:15.420
Wayne: We-we found it aro—Yeah, we found
it around like-I

1:50:15.420,1:50:19.810
don’t even think it had like a hundred views
when he found it, and like we-we

1:50:19.810,1:50:22.710
found it, and we shared it around a little
bit, and it got a little boost, and

1:50:22.710,1:50:25.400
then from there it got shared around a little
bit. Back then when we found it,

1:50:25.400,1:50:29.320
none of us were even remotely popular. Yeah,
it was-it was like around—yeah.

1:50:29.320,1:50:31.150
Trog: We were all children.

1:50:31.150,1:50:32.150
Gir: Basically.

1:50:32.150,1:50:33.150
Trog: Practically.

1:50:33.150,1:50:36.610
Wayne: Real quick, I thought of one last one,
and I’ve shown it on like movie nights and

1:50:36.610,1:50:41.560
shit, it’s one of my favorite videos. It’s
literally titled, ‘MOV 3974 MOV’ like

1:50:41.560,1:50:46.290
.mov, and it’s a video of like, some dude
in his car like, saying like, “Yo, we drove

1:50:46.290,1:50:50.480
out here, the middle of nowhere, you better
give us all—you better give us your money

1:50:50.480,1:50:54.810
or this baby gets it!” And he’s in his
car with like his dog, wearing like a ski

1:50:54.810,1:51:00.219
mask, and he just pulls out like a little
plastic figure of a-of a fetus it’s just—I

1:51:00.219,1:51:03.610
can’t describe the video I’d have to-I’d
have to link it to you. We should probably

1:51:03.610,1:51:06.920
gather links for these videos so we can like,
put them in the description so

1:51:06.920,1:51:07.920
people can watch them.

1:51:07.920,1:51:12.230
Trog: This is a question from Gwimble, who
says, “What is

1:51:12.230,1:51:16.329
the absolute hardest a joke you’ve made
flopped, either in its terribleness or

1:51:16.329,1:51:20.750
its overall effort-to-enjoyment ratio? On
the flipside, what’s the lowest

1:51:20.750,1:51:23.560
effort joke you’ve done that’s gotten
the biggest reaction?”

1:51:23.560,1:51:25.060
Gir: I want to come out right—

1:51:25.060,1:51:26.060
Wayne: [Crosstalk] That’s a good question.

1:51:26.060,1:51:29.390
Gir: Come swingin’ right outta the gates
here, uh, in recent

1:51:29.390,1:51:33.770
memory, the worst—I don’t even remember
what the joke was, it was that bad, but

1:51:33.770,1:51:39.080
then uh, Wayne like let out—It was when
you let out like the most pathetic

1:51:39.080,1:51:42.980
like, fake laugh, and I was like, “That
wasn’t-that wasn’t funny, you didn’t

1:51:42.980,1:51:43.980
have to laugh.”

1:51:43.980,1:51:46.190
Wayne: Yeah, I don’t even remember what
he said, it was-it

1:51:46.190,1:51:50.079
was so just like-it was so pr—It was just
the kind of thing that like, he

1:51:50.079,1:51:52.921
didn’t even put like, much thought into,
he just kind of said it—

1:51:52.921,1:51:55.369
Gir: It was just something I said in passing,
and then you

1:51:55.369,1:51:56.369
were like, “Hahaha.”

1:51:56.369,1:51:59.480
Wayne: Just kind of a passing like, punny
kind of joke, and

1:51:59.480,1:52:02.619
like, and I was—I think I was playing Fall
Guys and I heard that and I was

1:52:02.619,1:52:08.410
like, in my head I was like, “Well, that
sucks,” and I was like—I wasn’t gonna

1:52:08.410,1:52:12.070
laugh or anything, but for some reason I was
so focused on the game I just went

1:52:12.070,1:52:15.710
like, “Ha…haha…” I just made like-the
most like antagonistic, pathetic laugh,

1:52:15.710,1:52:20.380
and Gir was like, “Eh, you know you didn’t
have to laugh.” Like it was just

1:52:20.380,1:52:21.380
[laughs].

1:52:21.380,1:52:22.380
[Trog laughs]

1:52:22.380,1:52:23.440
Baaulp: Ah, geez.

1:52:23.440,1:52:27.280
Gir: And conversely, the lowest effort thing
that got-that

1:52:27.280,1:52:34.020
got a lot of laughter was when we were in
Texas and it was like me, Wayne, Log,

1:52:34.020,1:52:38.060
and Lauren in the car, and I just pointed
at somebody and was like, “Hey, we

1:52:38.060,1:52:39.179
should run that guy over [laughs].”

1:52:39.179,1:52:41.540
Wayne: No, you said—You pointed at him and
said, “We should

1:52:41.540,1:52:42.540
kill that guy.” Just like—

1:52:42.540,1:52:43.540
[Trog laughs]

1:52:43.540,1:52:44.540
Gir: Yeah, I was like, “We should just kill
that guy.”

1:52:44.540,1:52:46.310
Wayne: It was [laughs] I don’t even think
we were in a car,

1:52:46.310,1:52:48.580
we were just walking around and you said that
and—

1:52:48.580,1:52:50.980
Gir: No, we were in the car! We were in the
car! That’s why

1:52:50.980,1:52:52.409
the first thing I said was run him over!

1:52:52.409,1:52:54.489
Wayne: That’s probably why not everyone
knows it, because we

1:52:54.489,1:52:55.489
were split into two groups at the time.

1:52:55.489,1:52:56.489
Baaulp: Yeah, I missed that on that.

1:52:56.489,1:52:59.320
Gir: But you guys like fuckin’ lost it and
I was like, “Why?

1:52:59.320,1:53:01.699
I just said we should kill a guy, that’s
all.”

1:53:01.699,1:53:03.940
Wayne: Ahh, this is a hard one for me.

1:53:03.940,1:53:08.270
Baaulp: I can’t remember the last time I
fell flat with a

1:53:08.270,1:53:12.949
high effort joke, I try—My brain probably
blocks that shit out.

1:53:12.949,1:53:13.949
Trog: Yeah.

1:53:13.949,1:53:14.949
Wayne: Traumatizing.

1:53:14.949,1:53:17.350
Baaulp: Man, I-I’ve gotten to the point
where I’m such good

1:53:17.350,1:53:22.510
friends with you all I know all the-I know
all the low effort buttons I can-I

1:53:22.510,1:53:23.510
can push.

1:53:23.510,1:53:24.510
Wayne: Yeah.

1:53:24.510,1:53:25.780
Baaulp: The low—Like, uh, this isn’t—

1:53:25.780,1:53:27.410
Wayne: Oh, [claps] I have your answer.

1:53:27.410,1:53:29.810
Baaulp: You have my answer, what is it?

1:53:29.810,1:53:33.360
Wayne: The—For-for-for Baaulp’s low effort
joke that got the biggest reaction, there

1:53:33.360,1:53:37.739
was like, I cannot remember for the life of
me what the conversation was about, but I

1:53:37.739,1:53:40.370
was there, Mira was there, maybe a few other
people were there, but Mira and I remember

1:53:40.370,1:53:45.480
this very vividly, and we were having some
conversation about like, playgrounds or something

1:53:45.480,1:53:50.280
like that, and Baaulp just said, in the stupidest
voice, it just came out of nowhere and made

1:53:50.280,1:53:52.680
no fuckin’ sense relative to what we were
talking about—

1:53:52.680,1:53:53.680
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Oh, yeah.

1:53:53.680,1:53:55.460
Wayne: Baaulp just said, like, “Hey, I’ve
got some uh,

1:53:55.460,1:53:56.460
important monkey bars, here.”

1:53:56.460,1:53:58.020
Gir, laughing: [Crosstalk] I forgot about
that!

1:53:58.020,1:54:02.179
Wayne: And like, it made Mira and I laugh
so hard we almost

1:54:02.179,1:54:07.090
passed out. We were like, crying, like it
was-I don’t—The fucked up thing is

1:54:07.090,1:54:10.280
like, to everyone listening, everyone’s
just like, “What are you—Why?” Like,

1:54:10.280,1:54:14.159
and I could not tell you. Like it was just—just
a ‘you had to be there’ kind of

1:54:14.159,1:54:15.159
thing—

1:54:15.159,1:54:16.159
Gir: [Crosstalk] In the moment, yeah.

1:54:16.159,1:54:17.159
Wayne: It was in the moment, I don’t even
remember the

1:54:17.159,1:54:20.860
context, but I will never forget it. It was
just so dumb and out

1:54:20.860,1:54:23.050
of nowhere, it killed us.

1:54:23.050,1:54:26.210
Gir: I-I very vividly remember Mira gasping
for air.

1:54:26.210,1:54:28.900
Trog: I can’t think of it, I-I feel like
it’s almost like a

1:54:28.900,1:54:31.980
fear of mine, where it’s like, I feel like—‘Cause
I was thinking of this

1:54:31.980,1:54:35.610
question in terms of like, stream stuff that
we’ve done?

1:54:35.610,1:54:37.870
Wayne: Yeah, I mean, for the high effort stuff
that

1:54:37.870,1:54:40.760
definitely would be where that would come
up into play.

1:54:40.760,1:54:43.790
Trog: Maybe I’m gonna jinx us here, we’re
gonna have a real stinker here in the future,

1:54:43.790,1:54:49.820
but it’s like, I feel like everything that
we’ve put like, a lot of effort into, I

1:54:49.820,1:54:55.090
can’t really think of anything that’s
like, flopped. Like nothing, nothing that’s

1:54:55.090,1:54:58.900
flopped like hard, where it’s like, “Oh,
nobody thought that this was funny.”

1:54:58.900,1:54:59.900
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Yeah—

1:54:59.900,1:55:01.901
Baaulp: Well I mean, the thing is like, we
usually have a

1:55:01.901,1:55:07.440
good grasp on it, like, we don’t just throw
shit out there, we usually run it

1:55:07.440,1:55:12.230
by with each other, and that means that if
it isn’t funny it never gets in. 

1:55:12.230,1:55:13.230
Trog: I suppose.

1:55:13.230,1:55:14.500
Baaulp: Like, we’re pretty good about that.

1:55:14.500,1:55:16.960
Trog: I can think of like, technical fuck
ups that have

1:55:16.960,1:55:19.220
happened, but nothing that’s like, been—

1:55:19.220,1:55:20.909
Wayne: Usually that makes things funnier.

1:55:20.909,1:55:21.909
Trog: Yeah, that’s true.

1:55:21.909,1:55:24.410
Wayne: I’m like, trying to think of like,
earlier streams

1:55:24.410,1:55:29.960
like, I feel like pre-Gub Gar I didn’t do
a whole lot of like, crazy stuff

1:55:29.960,1:55:30.960
like, on-with my Twitch channel.

1:55:30.960,1:55:34.860
Trog: [Crosstalk] Well, Gub Gar was the first
like, big stream that I can think of.

1:55:34.860,1:55:37.280
Wayne: That was-that was like, six months
in, and it was

1:55:37.280,1:55:41.179
like the first like big, higher concept joke
that I did. The uh—

1:55:41.179,1:55:42.980
Trog: Culmination of an ARG.

1:55:42.980,1:55:47.360
Wayne: I’m trying to think if there’s
anything—I feel like, like

1:55:47.360,1:55:51.090
I’ve had more things happen that are like
higher effort that don’t get a lot of

1:55:51.090,1:55:52.739
attention, less so than like, things like
hitting—

1:55:52.739,1:55:53.940
Trog:  Right, yeah.

1:55:53.940,1:55:57.490
Wayne: ‘Cause like-like some things I look-I
look upon very

1:55:57.490,1:56:03.720
fondly, like G-33 Babel Initiative, which
is a stream where I got a gorilla

1:56:03.720,1:56:04.720
costume—

1:56:04.720,1:56:05.720
Trog: Oh, yeah.

1:56:05.720,1:56:07.670
Wayne: And we set up an-we set up an OBS scene
where Trog

1:56:07.670,1:56:12.650
and Baaulp were behind glass and were scientists
examining a gorilla playing

1:56:12.650,1:56:18.780
video games. It was a pretty weird concept
that was a little hard to pull off,

1:56:18.780,1:56:24.090
I think it was pretty funny, but it was-it
was like—it definitely was not as

1:56:24.090,1:56:27.409
well executed as it could have been because
like, I don’t think I gave a very

1:56:27.409,1:56:31.980
clear idea to Trog and Baaulp as to what I
wanted you guys to do, so like—

1:56:31.980,1:56:35.920
Trog: Yeah. You know what, legitimately, I
forgot about that stream, so I think that’s

1:56:35.920,1:56:40.592
my answer. Like, that-that stream it wasn’t
like a flop-flop, but it was like—It’s

1:56:40.592,1:56:41.592
literally like out of all the—

1:56:41.592,1:56:42.630
Wayne: [Crosstalk] It had some very funny
moments.

1:56:42.630,1:56:45.110
Trog: —out of all the bit streams that we
did, that’s the

1:56:45.110,1:56:49.659
only one I literally didn’t remember being
a part of until Wayne just brought it

1:56:49.659,1:56:51.550
up. It has to be my answer.

1:56:51.550,1:56:54.699
Wayne: [Laughs] I thought that one like, it
was good, it

1:56:54.699,1:56:57.170
probably could have been workshopped more,
like we probably coulda put more

1:56:57.170,1:56:58.170
time like—

1:56:58.170,1:56:59.960
Trog: I think you’re right. Me and Baaulp
just didn’t really

1:56:59.960,1:57:03.739
have a lot of direction, you had an idea of
like, “Alright, we’re gonna have me

1:57:03.739,1:57:08.270
in a gorilla costume, playing like, fucking
Apex Legend,” and I was like,

1:57:08.270,1:57:11.780
“That’s kind of funny in concept, but
what am I supposed to do?” And it’s like,

1:57:11.780,1:57:13.790
“Oh, I don’t know, just like talk about
it.” Like, “Alright.”

1:57:13.790,1:57:14.960
Gir: Oh yeah, I was a part of that, too.

1:57:14.960,1:57:15.960
Log: Oh, yeah.

1:57:15.960,1:57:16.960
Wayne: No, you weren’t.

1:57:16.960,1:57:17.960
Gir: Yeah, I was!

1:57:17.960,1:57:18.960
[Wayne laughs hard]

1:57:18.960,1:57:19.960
Wayne: No, you weren’t! How were you a part
of it? Oh wait

1:57:19.960,1:57:25.370
no, you and-you and-you—Log, I forgot about
Log and—See, I’m forgetting things

1:57:25.370,1:57:29.780
too. Log and Gir played Apex Legends with
me as the gorilla, which I also

1:57:29.780,1:57:31.280
thought was a pretty funny idea.

1:57:31.280,1:57:33.800
Gir: Literally the only time in my life I’ve
played Apex

1:57:33.800,1:57:34.800
Legends.

1:57:34.800,1:57:40.650
Wayne: So, I had a pretty clear idea in my
head of like, what I wanted it to be, and

1:57:40.650,1:57:45.900
like I had this idea in my head of how Trog
and Baaulp were gonna act, but like, I didn’t

1:57:45.900,1:57:50.969
want to be too directive, so I didn’t say
anything and then like, and then it just ended

1:57:50.969,1:57:54.510
up like, I was just sittin’ there slappin’
the controller and they were just like, “What

1:57:54.510,1:57:56.989
do we, like, what do we say about this.”

1:57:56.989,1:58:00.840
Trog: Yeah, it’s like, we definitely needed
more stage

1:58:00.840,1:58:04.619
direction, I was like, “I’m not sure what
direction I need to take this in.”

1:58:04.619,1:58:07.070
Wayne: I should have been a little bit more-a
little bit

1:58:07.070,1:58:12.060
more commanding with that. But it had-it had
some-some very fun- funny moments

1:58:12.060,1:58:17.210
like, such as like, the controller kept unplugging,
and like there were a lot

1:58:17.210,1:58:21.080
of good funny moments with like, you guys
talking about me like, “Oh, he-he

1:58:21.080,1:58:26.210
unplugged the fucking controller again, he
keeps unplugging the USB,” The uh-the

1:58:26.210,1:58:29.340
like, the funniest thing that happened—

1:58:29.340,1:58:32.550
Trog: Pulley system with a banana, I remember
that.

1:58:32.550,1:58:37.020
Wayne: Oh, yeah! That was like, I-that was
like the one-one

1:58:37.020,1:58:41.080
other gag I had in mind which was like, I
fastened a hook to my ceiling, which

1:58:41.080,1:58:47.230
is still there, I’m looking at it right
now, and I tied a banana around a very

1:58:47.230,1:58:48.230
fine, like—

1:58:48.230,1:58:49.230
[Trog laughs]

1:58:49.230,1:58:51.210
Wayne: —surprisingly sharp thread, and like-and
like hooked

1:58:51.210,1:58:53.210
it up like, to a—

1:58:53.210,1:58:54.210
[Baaulp laughs]

1:58:54.210,1:58:57.310
Wayne: I’m sorry, but with-with this app
I can hear every

1:58:57.310,1:59:00.270
little noise Baaulp makes, and I—Apparently
Baaulp like, charges his laughs,

1:59:00.270,1:59:01.270
like—

1:59:01.270,1:59:02.270
[Trog laughs]

1:59:02.270,1:59:03.270
Baaulp: Yeah, I do.

1:59:03.270,1:59:05.940
Wayne: [Laughs] Like, you-it might not come
through the

1:59:05.940,1:59:09.170
final recording, but like, when I-when I know
something is funny to Baaulp,

1:59:09.170,1:59:12.340
this is not something I hear in person or
in Discord, this mic here is just

1:59:12.340,1:59:13.340
more sensitive—I just hear him go like,
[Wayne imitates a slide whistle going

1:59:13.340,1:59:14.340
up in tone]—

1:59:14.340,1:59:15.340
Trog, laughing: He’s charging it, dude!

1:59:15.340,1:59:16.340
[Log laughs]

1:59:16.340,1:59:17.340
Wayne, laughing: He’s just like getting
ready to laugh!

1:59:17.340,1:59:19.920
Trog: He’s chargin’ it!

1:59:19.920,1:59:24.270
Wayne: [Laughs] And it totally ruined me.
So like, yeah, I

1:59:24.270,1:59:29.090
tied a banana to a thread, and I hooked it
to my ceiling, and I like, fastened

1:59:29.090,1:59:33.630
the hook on a heavy object, and like, at some
point during the stream I was

1:59:33.630,1:59:36.400
like, “Alright, I want you guys to give
me like positive reinforcement, like,

1:59:36.400,1:59:41.400
drop a banana into my cell,” and like, at
some point they did that, and like, I

1:59:41.400,1:59:46.150
was the only one, I’m only the-the only
one at my place for like physical help

1:59:46.150,1:59:51.090
ever, so when you said that, I had to like
stick my leg off camera and like,

1:59:51.090,1:59:57.170
kick the book so the banana fell and like
[laughs] and the banana—It’s crazy

1:59:57.170,1:59:59.360
how quickly a banana gets gross—

1:59:59.360,2:00:00.360
[Trog laughs]

2:00:00.360,2:00:03.199
Wayne: —once it’s like, open. Like, ‘cause
by tying the

2:00:03.199,2:00:05.960
thread, it squeezed the banana and caused
an opening, so the banana that was

2:00:05.960,2:00:10.100
perfectly fine like, the hour or two before
the joke actually happened, when I

2:00:10.100,2:00:12.590
set it up, came down a gnarly, and black,
and disgusting.

2:00:12.590,2:00:13.590
Trog: Ew.

2:00:13.590,2:00:15.469
[Baaulp makes sounds of disgust while Log
laughs]

2:00:15.469,2:00:17.070
Trog: Yeah, alright. That’s definitely the
answer.

2:00:17.070,2:00:18.170
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Like, it was bad. It was
fuckin’ bad, and

2:00:18.170,2:00:19.170
I think like--

2:00:19.170,2:00:23.630
Trog: And I legitimately forgot I was—that
that even happened. Like, gave me a brain

2:00:23.630,2:00:24.630
blast.

2:00:24.630,2:00:26.440
Wayne: [Laughs] It’s on the vods channel,
if you’re hearing

2:00:26.440,2:00:29.909
this and you’re curious, it’s still a
good watch even if it was kind of messy.

2:00:29.909,2:00:34.810
The funniest thing that happened in the stream
though, was uh, I was using a DS4

2:00:34.810,2:00:38.590
controller hooked up to my computer, for some
reason, back—I don’t know if this

2:00:38.590,2:00:44.810
is still a thing, but back then the native
input when you press the PS button

2:00:44.810,2:00:50.170
on a DS4 controller, it commands media programs.
For whatever reason, if you

2:00:50.170,2:00:53.949
start-if you have like a MP3 player open or
something like that, it will-it’ll

2:00:53.949,2:00:59.699
start playing a sound. And for that stream,
I-I had foobar open, which is my

2:00:59.699,2:01:02.610
media player of choice, it’s very bare bones,
very simple, but I didn’t have my

2:01:02.610,2:01:07.411
music open, I had my sound effects tab open,
and at the time I was doing—I had

2:01:07.411,2:01:12.520
previously done a joke involving Sora in Kingdom
Hearts 2, so I accidentally hit

2:01:12.520,2:01:16.389
the PS button and we’re doing this bit,
and all of a sudden you just hear Sora

2:01:16.389,2:01:19.000
go, “[Inhale] Donald! Goofy! Hyah! Neuh!
Fire!”

2:01:19.000,2:01:20.120
Gir: [Crosstalk] “Aladdin!”

2:01:20.120,2:01:21.120
[Baaulp laughs]

2:01:21.120,2:01:23.650
Wayne: Like, “Aladdin!” [Laughs] And I’m
like, I like-my

2:01:23.650,2:01:27.271
jaw, in the gorilla costume, just dropped
and I started laughing so hard I was

2:01:27.271,2:01:31.210
crying and we had this like, and you guys-I
don’t think you guys could hear it—

2:01:31.210,2:01:32.210
Trog: No, we couldn’t.

2:01:32.210,2:01:34.020
Wayne: So like, all of a sudden-all of a sudden
I’m just

2:01:34.020,2:01:37.460
like, sobbing and we had this signal where
if I put my hands on my head that

2:01:37.460,2:01:40.340
means you need to cut to break because I couldn’t
talk, because I was a

2:01:40.340,2:01:43.870
gorilla, and like, they’re like, “I think
the monkey’s crying.” Like it was

2:01:43.870,2:01:44.870
just—

2:01:44.870,2:01:45.870
[Log and Baaulp laugh]

2:01:45.870,2:01:46.870
Wayne: It was such a good moment.

2:01:46.870,2:01:49.960
Trog: It was so weird, yeah, because neither
me nor Baaulp

2:01:49.960,2:01:54.880
had stream audio, so we didn’t know what
the fuck—so we just like, didn’t react

2:01:54.880,2:01:59.210
to this bizarre scenario that just happened
because we had no context.

2:01:59.210,2:02:00.850
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

2:02:00.850,2:02:04.370
Trog: We-we-we—That was some sloppy production
on our part,

2:02:04.370,2:02:06.500
we-we’ve cleaned it up since then.

2:02:06.500,2:02:08.620
Gir: [Crosstalk] Learned from growing pains.

2:02:08.620,2:02:09.620
Baaulp: That was the early days.

2:02:09.620,2:02:12.030
Wayne: That was also like, I was still—I’m
always figuring

2:02:12.030,2:02:15.190
out the kinks in my fucked up greenscreen
set up, and like, that one—

2:02:15.190,2:02:16.190
Trog: [Crosstalk] Oh, yeah, that shit’s
[unintelligible].

2:02:16.190,2:02:17.190
Gir: [Crosstalk] Oh, you fucked it up every
single time.

2:02:17.190,2:02:20.770
Wayne: I had it like—there-there was like,
I was sitting on

2:02:20.770,2:02:24.580
the floor, so that’s extra prone to fuck
ups. I had the green screen like—there

2:02:24.580,2:02:27.610
was a nail in my wall that like a painting
used to be hung on, I had the

2:02:27.610,2:02:31.130
greenscreen like, pushed into that and then
clothesline clipped onto that, it

2:02:31.130,2:02:34.570
was the worst set up. I’ve now figured out
that I literally just use duct tape

2:02:34.570,2:02:39.489
and I tape it to the ceiling, that’s more
effective. But, the fuckin’ like—I

2:02:39.489,2:02:43.131
would just like sit wrong and all of a sudden
the greenscreen would fall and

2:02:43.131,2:02:46.020
you would just see this pile of boxes in the
corner of my room and you guys

2:02:46.020,2:02:48.350
were just like, “The gorilla has opened
up a hole in the void.”

2:02:48.350,2:02:52.520
Trog: “There’s been a-a breach.” It’s
funny in hindsight.

2:02:52.520,2:02:56.650
During the actual performance, it probably
could have been funnier. But it’s

2:02:56.650,2:02:58.610
funny to think about how fucked up it was.

2:02:58.610,2:02:59.610
Wayne: Yeah.

2:02:59.610,2:03:01.760
Log: I don’t know like, all of my-all of
my high effort

2:03:01.760,2:03:04.869
stuff is just uh, Gather Ye Power.

2:03:04.869,2:03:07.960
Gir: Hard to tell if any of the jokes land
or not in that

2:03:07.960,2:03:08.960
sense.

2:03:08.960,2:03:10.930
Wayne: Yeah, you don’t get that immediate
feedback, but I

2:03:10.930,2:03:13.840
think your humor in that lands. There’s
definitely some stuff that genuinely made

2:03:13.840,2:03:14.840
me laugh out loud.

2:03:14.840,2:03:17.261
Log: And I mean like, it’s not like I have
that big of a

2:03:17.261,2:03:22.310
viewership in the first place, so if anybody
goes out of their way to talk about

2:03:22.310,2:03:24.200
anything in that, that’s like-that’s like
shocking.

2:03:24.200,2:03:29.290
Wayne: I think a joke—I just want to compliment
you, I think

2:03:29.290,2:03:31.880
a joke in Gather Ye Power that still sticks
with me-I might be—I might be

2:03:31.880,2:03:34.380
miswording it, but it was like, one of your
side characters saying, “I’ll make you

2:03:34.380,2:03:36.921
wish the circus was never born!” Or something
like that.

2:03:36.921,2:03:39.790
Log: That was the main character. That was
Cube himself.

2:03:39.790,2:03:43.140
Wayne: Cube said that? Yeah, well, I remember
the line, not

2:03:43.140,2:03:44.140
who said it.

2:03:44.140,2:03:47.020
Log: [Laughs] So, that-that one was good,
I felt good about

2:03:47.020,2:03:51.630
that one, but one that I was like, for whatever
reason I thought, “People will

2:03:51.630,2:03:57.500
like this one a lot,” because I like this
one a lot, um, I had just like a

2:03:57.500,2:04:01.860
guardsman just standing in front of a-of like
a cart with-filled with bags of

2:04:01.860,2:04:07.840
money, and he was counting, so he was counting
like, “Nineteen, twenty,

2:04:07.840,2:04:12.150
twenty-one, those are my three favorite numbers.
And there’s twelve bags of

2:04:12.150,2:04:13.440
money in the cart.”

2:04:13.440,2:04:14.949
Gir: Okay, yeah, I remember that gag. That’s
a-that was a

2:04:14.949,2:04:15.949
good one.

2:04:15.949,2:04:18.360
Log: I thought, “Oh, that’s perfect.”
But yeah, nobody

2:04:18.360,2:04:21.520
really said anything about that one, so I
don’t know.

2:04:21.520,2:04:22.520
[Wayne laughs]

2:04:22.520,2:04:23.520
Baaulp: What you’re gonna have to learn
is that the subtle

2:04:23.520,2:04:25.989
stuff always goes past people’s heads.

2:04:25.989,2:04:28.500
Wayne: But it like-even if it doesn’t make
people like laugh

2:04:28.500,2:04:31.340
out loud and be like, ‘ah, that part was
so funny,’ like, if it’s subtle it

2:04:31.340,2:04:35.660
adds to like-it’s just-it’s this procedural
like-you’re just stacking up,

2:04:35.660,2:04:39.930
you’re gaining this long term charm like,
that people will look back on and be like,

2:04:39.930,2:04:43.880
‘yeah, it’s a very charming comic,’
even if certain things didn’t get the gut

2:04:43.880,2:04:44.880
busts goin’.

2:04:44.880,2:04:47.599
Log: Perhaps, I don’t think anything has
been like a flop,

2:04:47.599,2:04:48.599
though.

2:04:48.599,2:04:50.980
Trog: That’s what I’m saying, that’s
where my anxieties lie.

2:04:50.980,2:04:52.250
I feel like we’re overdue.

2:04:52.250,2:04:53.639
Baaulp: Naaaah, naaaaah.

2:04:53.639,2:04:58.000
Wayne: Oh well. We’d recover. I’ve had
flop streams, but

2:04:58.000,2:04:59.000
that’s not the same, like—

2:04:59.000,2:05:02.730
Log: I think the best return on investment
was playing as

2:05:02.730,2:05:05.390
Joni in your um, AI Adventure Call.

2:05:05.390,2:05:08.179
Wayne: Ahh, that was great. Yeah, that was
like—

2:05:08.179,2:05:11.020
Log: I didn’t have to try very hard at all
for that one

2:05:11.020,2:05:12.020
[laughs].

2:05:12.020,2:05:13.520
Wayne: You knew-you knew exactly what you
were doing, and we

2:05:13.520,2:05:16.920
gave you the right prompt. The fuckin’ sheep
shearing quest.

2:05:16.920,2:05:19.530
Log: The stars aligned for that one, it was
perfect.

2:05:19.530,2:05:26.139
Baaulp: This question is from Wowwywowwow,
they ask, and-and

2:05:26.139,2:05:30.380
like, the first half I can just answer, ‘cause
this-I already know the answer,

2:05:30.380,2:05:33.910
but there’s an interesting second half that
we can kind of expand on. “Did any

2:05:33.910,2:05:37.849
of you have any theatrical training prior
to becoming streamers/before getting

2:05:37.849,2:05:42.830
into Twitch? If so, are there any fun theatre
games you wish were-uh, you wish

2:05:42.830,2:05:46.710
were possible to practice at the moment?”
So, the answer is no, I-I don’t like—

2:05:46.710,2:05:48.949
Wayne: Theatre games? What’s a theatre game?
[Laughs] I’m

2:05:48.949,2:05:50.139
not a theatre kid.

2:05:50.139,2:05:53.550
Baaulp: Kind of like games that you would…
kind of play with

2:05:53.550,2:05:58.730
other performers to like, get in the mood
of like, doing improv or like acting.

2:05:58.730,2:06:02.409
I—Do any of us have theatre experience?
The answer is no, right?

2:06:02.409,2:06:03.850
Log: I did theatre in high school.

2:06:03.850,2:06:06.030
Gir: I-I was gonna say, Log and Holly did.

2:06:06.030,2:06:08.380
Trog: I was in theatre in middle school.

2:06:08.380,2:06:12.060
Baaulp: Yeah, but like, for me, no, I don’t
think Wayne—Like, Wayne,

2:06:12.060,2:06:13.230
did you have any?

2:06:13.230,2:06:19.780
Wayne: I have never done anything like that.
And-and that’s the thing, getting into this,

2:06:19.780,2:06:24.210
getting into streaming, like, that side of
things was not something that I ever thought

2:06:24.210,2:06:29.230
I was gonna evoke, I’ve never considered
myself in the past to be like, a good actor,

2:06:29.230,2:06:32.710
and never thought that was something that
I was gonna like pursue. But then as it went

2:06:32.710,2:06:37.139
on, that ended up being a huge part of it,
and like, and it turns out we’re all pretty

2:06:37.139,2:06:41.761
g—okay at it. Like, I wouldn’t say we’re
all like amazing actors or anything, but

2:06:41.761,2:06:42.761
like—

2:06:42.761,2:06:44.469
Baaulp: I think to expand on that quest—that
second half of

2:06:44.469,2:06:46.540
that question, like are there any games that
you play, like—

2:06:46.540,2:06:49.630
Gir: I can answer that one, because I never
got into theatre

2:06:49.630,2:06:54.449
‘cause I was too shy of a kid back then,
but because of all the Whose Line I

2:06:54.449,2:06:57.240
watched, there were so many things that they
would do on Whose Line that I wish

2:06:57.240,2:06:58.940
that I had friends would do that with me.

2:06:58.940,2:07:00.490
Baaulp: I mean, here’s the thing—

2:07:00.490,2:07:01.490
Wayne: That’d be fun.

2:07:01.490,2:07:03.850
Baaulp: We do kind of do it-like, what I was
gonna say was,

2:07:03.850,2:07:07.900
we do kind of do our own version of that,
where like-like yeah, we don’t do

2:07:07.900,2:07:12.659
theatre, but when it comes to comedy like,
aren’t we just like—as a group of

2:07:12.659,2:07:17.280
friends, aren’t we just always trying to
make each other fuckin’ laugh, though?

2:07:17.280,2:07:18.280
Like—

2:07:18.280,2:07:20.449
Wayne: It’s improv without it being like,
forced and

2:07:20.449,2:07:22.869
annoying, because it’s just like, what we
do. The like—

2:07:22.869,2:07:28.239
Baaulp: We are like the evil Shaolin—we
are like the evil

2:07:28.239,2:07:32.270
Shaolin monk, lotus temple monastery of comedy,
like—

2:07:32.270,2:07:33.270
Gir, laughing: What?

2:07:33.270,2:07:34.270
Trog: [Unintelligible]

2:07:34.270,2:07:35.270
[Wayne laughs]

2:07:35.270,2:07:37.809
Baaulp: We are always tryin’ to make each
other laugh, it is

2:07:37.809,2:07:42.719
always on sight, like, there’s no-no rules
it’s like, “Oh, I’mma-I’mma

2:07:42.719,2:07:44.700
try-I’mma try to make them laugh today.”

2:07:44.700,2:07:48.140
Wayne: “Oh, Wayne just got stopped by the
cops? Let me play

2:07:48.140,2:07:49.140
policesiren.mp3 in the group chat.”

2:07:49.140,2:07:50.140
[Trog and Gir laugh]

2:07:50.140,2:07:51.140
Baaulp: Yeah!

2:07:51.140,2:07:52.140
Trog: That’s hilarious.

2:07:52.140,2:07:53.940
Wayne: Like the fuckin’-it is-it is literally
nonstop

2:07:53.940,2:07:56.489
twenty-four seven, anytime we are with each
other that’s what’s happening.

2:07:56.489,2:07:58.560
Gir: I guess that’s true, ‘cause like
when you would be

2:07:58.560,2:08:03.360
driving home from work and I would play the
fuckin audio clip I designed of you

2:08:03.360,2:08:07.340
being like, “Oh, my name is Wayne, oh shit!”
And then a car crash—

2:08:07.340,2:08:08.340
[Baaulp laughs]

2:08:08.340,2:08:11.270
Wayne: “OH SHIT!” Yeah, the fuckin’—and
like, it really, it

2:08:11.270,2:08:14.600
is the equivalent of like, Shaolin monks of
the temple like, making their

2:08:14.600,2:08:19.830
children like, hang from tree branches by
their toes and like, and how the

2:08:19.830,2:08:24.460
adults developing iron egg skill like, just
constantly like putting themselves

2:08:24.460,2:08:26.540
through these fucking trials and tribulations.

2:08:26.540,2:08:27.540
[Trog laughs]

2:08:27.540,2:08:29.559
Baaulp: Like, we don’t play any like, explicit
like—we don’t

2:08:29.559,2:08:34.430
do any routines, but like, we-we-we know how
to make each other laugh, and

2:08:34.430,2:08:38.290
we’re good at like being very snappy because
like, we are just constantly,

2:08:38.290,2:08:43.190
like, every—even the people who aren’t
usually like, appear on streams, we are

2:08:43.190,2:08:47.920
constantly just trying to make each other
laugh, it’s like, kind of, it’s

2:08:47.920,2:08:50.130
uni—it’s special. Let me—I think so.

2:08:50.130,2:08:54.010
Gir: I would like to sit us down one day and
do a handful of

2:08:54.010,2:08:58.040
things like that, like-like one of the like-uhh,
I’m trying to think of the

2:08:58.040,2:09:01.909
name of it, where it’s like-like where everybody
says one word to form a

2:09:01.909,2:09:04.060
sentence, and you go back and forth between
like two people.

2:09:04.060,2:09:06.310
Trog: Oh, god. Just real theatre class shit.

2:09:06.310,2:09:08.070
Wayne: We did that. I mean, that actually—I
always thought

2:09:08.070,2:09:11.929
that was fun, but like, we did that, there’s
a JackBox game that was just that,

2:09:11.929,2:09:15.540
Word Spud, like in the first JackBox game,
and it was very fun.

2:09:15.540,2:09:19.059
Log: I’m thinkin’, I just think back to
the type of games

2:09:19.059,2:09:25.310
that we would play whenever we’re doin’
um, basically any production in high

2:09:25.310,2:09:30.210
school. And really like, all that stuff was
just to um, help you get into sync

2:09:30.210,2:09:35.120
with other people and uh, break the ice, I
guess. But it’s just not really

2:09:35.120,2:09:37.250
necessary for this group, I’d say.

2:09:37.250,2:09:39.710
Gir: Yeah no, icebreaker ones, no. ‘Cause
we’re already—the

2:09:39.710,2:09:41.119
ice-there’s no ice to be broken.

2:09:41.119,2:09:43.570
Wayne: I already know these people like a
book I’ve read a

2:09:43.570,2:09:44.590
thousand times.

2:09:44.590,2:09:47.540
Trog: It’s really the fact that any time
we do any of the

2:09:47.540,2:09:52.329
like, big production things, or even the smaller
stuff, just anything that’s

2:09:52.329,2:09:59.630
like a concept, we don’t write. Like, we
don’t-we just don’t. We-we are not in

2:09:59.630,2:10:03.230
the habit of writing anything down, basically.

2:10:03.230,2:10:06.199
Wayne: I think-I think-I think another thing
that like, I

2:10:06.199,2:10:09.630
like about us when I said that we were like,
okay at acting, like we ended up

2:10:09.630,2:10:13.239
being okay at that, I feel like the fact that
we’re not perfect adds to it a

2:10:13.239,2:10:17.530
lot, because we all—something that we all
as a group think is very funny, fuck

2:10:17.530,2:10:18.530
ups.

2:10:18.530,2:10:19.530
Trog: Yeah.

2:10:19.530,2:10:20.530
Wayne: When things go wrong, it’s fucking
hilarious. And

2:10:20.530,2:10:23.962
like, and like that can be a technical difficulty,
or it can just be someone

2:10:23.962,2:10:28.179
like saying something wrong, or just like
not knowing what to say, like we

2:10:28.179,2:10:29.809
thrive on each other’s like, failure.

2:10:29.809,2:10:30.809
Baaulp: Yeah.

2:10:30.809,2:10:32.880
Trog: But I’m saying that in the-in the-in
the fact that

2:10:32.880,2:10:40.559
it’s like-like we don’t do improv games,
we just like… technically like, almost

2:10:40.559,2:10:45.239
any concept stream we do is improv just by
the fact of like, well we’re not

2:10:45.239,2:10:49.309
gonna take the time to write down jokes beforehand,
we’re just gonna come up

2:10:49.309,2:10:52.659
with them on the spot. That is just technically
improv.

2:10:52.659,2:10:56.380
Wayne: Mhmm. You forge it-you forge them in
fire like, it’s

2:10:56.380,2:10:58.170
funnier, like than if you pre-write it.

2:10:58.170,2:11:00.699
Baaulp: Well we do do—what the plan that
we do use is that

2:11:00.699,2:11:06.260
we usually give ourselves a good jumping-we
give ourselves a good, yeah, jumping

2:11:06.260,2:11:10.090
off point to like, facilitate it, and we just
kind of like, hit the ground running.

2:11:10.090,2:11:12.920
Trog: Like for instance with the GameClam
thing like, we-we

2:11:12.920,2:11:17.309
like—Scorpy wrote up, ‘cause he directed
that one, Scorpy like, had a Google

2:11:17.309,2:11:22.010
Docs that just had an outline of like, “Alright,
Wayne’s gonna talk about this, then we’re

2:11:22.010,2:11:26.270
gonna play these videos, then Wayne’s gonna
talk about this,” and we talked about jokes,

2:11:26.270,2:11:31.390
like the day of beforehand, but we didn’t
like, wr—like nobody was ever reading off

2:11:31.390,2:11:33.460
of a script or anything like that.

2:11:33.460,2:11:36.260
Wayne: The one script in AI-dventure Call
that I had was

2:11:36.260,2:11:39.710
like, I prewrote the little limerick I said
at the intro ‘cause I can’t come up

2:11:39.710,2:11:43.580
with something like that on the spot, and
if I do it’ll be like really bad

2:11:43.580,2:11:44.580
[laughs].

2:11:44.580,2:11:46.770
Gir: And you know what, there was one time
Scorpy made

2:11:46.770,2:11:50.500
something where Wayne was reading a script
and Wayne fucking up was added into

2:11:50.500,2:11:51.679
the final product [unintelligible].

2:11:51.679,2:11:53.719
Trog: Oh yeah, that’s right. That doesn’t
really count, Gir,

2:11:53.719,2:11:55.369
that wasn’t a stream, that was for a project.

2:11:55.369,2:11:57.450
Gir: No, that was—but you know what I’m
sayin’.

2:11:57.450,2:11:59.450
Wayne: Yeah, Scorpy’s projects are pre-written
but that’s a

2:11:59.450,2:12:00.450
totally different thing, like—

2:12:00.450,2:12:02.139
Gir: Scorpy’s the only one of us that will
write things.

2:12:02.139,2:12:03.139
Like, at all.

2:12:03.139,2:12:05.230
Baaulp: That really says that like, “Hey,
here’s a

2:12:05.230,2:12:09.460
pre-written thing,” and he added a fuck
up to it, and it made it so much better

2:12:09.460,2:12:10.460
[laughs].

2:12:10.460,2:12:11.460
Gir: Yeah, [unintelligible].

2:12:11.460,2:12:12.460
Wayne: Yeah.

2:12:12.460,2:12:14.010
Baaulp: You don’t need to break the ice
if you are—have already

2:12:14.010,2:12:16.150
been friends for more than a decade.

2:12:16.150,2:12:18.780
Wayne: So I have a-I have another question
real

2:12:18.780,2:12:22.889
quick. This one’s an easy one, well, it’s
not so much an easy one as it’s like,

2:12:22.889,2:12:27.300
more on the jokey side, but it got me thinking
as soon as I read it.

2:12:27.300,2:12:32.380
Jimmiefingers in our Discord asks, “How
do you feel about ‘Best-By’ dates on

2:12:32.380,2:12:36.800
food?” And I read that and I was like, I
mean it’s important, right? 

2:12:36.800,2:12:37.800
Gir: [Unintelligible].

2:12:37.800,2:12:38.800
Trog: [Crosstalk] Mhmm.

2:12:38.800,2:12:42.210
Wayne: But they make me mad. They make me
mad because like,

2:12:42.210,2:12:49.449
if-if I have food that is past the best-by
date, like, I will sit there and like,

2:12:49.449,2:12:54.170
just fucking like introspect for like, three
minutes, staring at the food,

2:12:54.170,2:12:56.350
smelling it, inspecting it, and just being
like, “[Sharp inhale] I—can I—I don’t—Can

2:12:56.350,2:13:01.300
I eat this? Like, it’s like two days past
the thing,” like it just, it annoys

2:13:01.300,2:13:03.110
me. I wish there was like a better way.

2:13:03.110,2:13:05.500
Gir: You have to have some logic about it.
There’s certain

2:13:05.500,2:13:07.510
things that you would know after a while.

2:13:07.510,2:13:08.510
Wayne: Yeah.

2:13:08.510,2:13:12.900
Gir: Like if it’s-if a date on there says
that it expires at that time, for certain

2:13:12.900,2:13:16.739
things, yeah, immediately just fucking get
rid of it. Other things, that thing’s probably

2:13:16.739,2:13:18.110
still good for another month.

2:13:18.110,2:13:22.599
Wayne: It-it makes-it makes me mad sometimes
with like meat,

2:13:22.599,2:13:26.880
like-like lunch meat. Like sometimes it’ll
be-it’ll be like past the expiration

2:13:26.880,2:13:32.010
date, but like, it like smells fine—Like-like
the give-the give with meat

2:13:32.010,2:13:34.130
sometimes is not the smell, but it’s like,
if there’s like slime. Like if

2:13:34.130,2:13:35.130
you—

2:13:35.130,2:13:36.960
Gir: [Crosstalk] The texture, if it’s slimy.
Yeah, ‘cause lunch meat

2:13:36.960,2:13:39.590
I feel like always smells like farts regardless,
so.

2:13:39.590,2:13:43.969
Wayne: The thing is is like, the slime test
fucks me up, because

2:13:43.969,2:13:48.540
sometimes lunch meat is slimy from the start.
Not like super slimy, but like a little

2:13:48.540,2:13:52.550
bit slippery, like it’s just a little bit
wet. Like if you buy deli cut like,

2:13:52.550,2:13:57.340
cold cuts, you get some of that. There’s
a-there’s a point where it’s obvious,

2:13:57.340,2:14:01.179
there’s a point where it’s obvious and
you need to throw it away. If it’s like

2:14:01.179,2:14:03.070
congealed,
you need to just fuckin’ get rid of that

2:14:03.070,2:14:04.070
shit.

2:14:04.070,2:14:06.860
Trog: I think I take the opposite approach
as you, Wayne, in which I find the best-by

2:14:06.860,2:14:13.619
date a comforting reminder of like, I-I get
anxious when it’s before the best-by day,

2:14:13.619,2:14:18.360
but like close, and then like once it hits
the best-by date I’m like, “Alright, cool,

2:14:18.360,2:14:24.050
it’s done.” I-I take this as law, so that
I don’t have to have that moral conundrum

2:14:24.050,2:14:27.380
of like, “Should I throw this out?” It’s
like, “Oh, it’s past the date? It doesn’t

2:14:27.380,2:14:30.500
matter I’m not gonna
check I’m just gonna throw it away.” It’s-it’s

2:14:30.500,2:14:33.710
out of my hands, Father Time has taken this
pack of ham from me.

2:14:33.710,2:14:36.140
Wayne: I mean, does that motivate you? Does
that motivate

2:14:36.140,2:14:38.850
you to be less wasteful and not buy food that
you’re not gonna eat?

2:14:38.850,2:14:39.880
Trog: Oh, hell no.

2:14:39.880,2:14:40.880
[Baaulp laughs]

2:14:40.880,2:14:41.880
Wayne: What the fuck, man? You gotta be better.

2:14:41.880,2:14:45.020
Trog: No, it makes me feel worse actually,
‘cause then I-I’m

2:14:45.020,2:14:48.540
like, I check my fridge it’s like, “Ah
shit, I gotta throw all this shit away,

2:14:48.540,2:14:51.360
I didn’t-I didn’t eat this—Why did I
think it was a good idea to buy three

2:14:51.360,2:14:54.330
cartons of eggs? When was I ever gonna eat
this?”

2:14:54.330,2:14:56.949
Baaulp: Three cartons of eggs? Damn.

2:14:56.949,2:14:59.360
Wayne: You go to the grocery store and it’s
like, “Oh yeah,

2:14:59.360,2:15:01.350
I’ll need all this stuff, and I’ll make
so many cool meals,” but then it just comes

2:15:01.350,2:15:02.820
around to it and it didn’t happen, and then
you just have—

2:15:02.820,2:15:05.159
Trog: [Crosstalk] And it just doesn’t happen,
and then you go order burritos again.

2:15:05.159,2:15:08.989
Gir: Yeah, that’s every time I buy food.
I will buy like, so

2:15:08.989,2:15:13.159
much shit-I’ll buy so much shit and then
like, an hour after I’ve put it away I

2:15:13.159,2:15:14.559
forgot that I just got it.

2:15:14.559,2:15:17.360
Wayne: It happens to me especially, like,
‘cause I still don’t

2:15:17.360,2:15:21.619
have my own place, I’m barred by the pandemic
from having one at the moment,

2:15:21.619,2:15:26.040
like-where like I’ll buy things to make
my own dinner, and like, then like the days

2:15:26.040,2:15:29.860
where I want to make it, like someone else
is using the kitchen and I like, don’t—

2:15:29.860,2:15:30.860
Gir: Yeah!

2:15:30.860,2:15:32.880
Wayne: There’s nothing more that I hate
than trying to use

2:15:32.880,2:15:35.300
the kitchen at the same time as someone else.

2:15:35.300,2:15:37.560
Gir: That’s exactly why I rarely cook for
myself, is I’m in

2:15:37.560,2:15:41.020
the exact same situation, it’s like, “Oh,
today I wanna make like that jambalaya,

2:15:41.020,2:15:44.909
yeah,” I’ll go out there and every-like
all the dishes are dirty already, there’s

2:15:44.909,2:15:47.190
somebody out there already making something,
it’s like, “Oh, I guess I’ll uh,

2:15:47.190,2:15:48.190
guess I’m eating ramen.”

2:15:48.190,2:15:51.889
Wayne: Can’t wait to have my own kitchen.
Oh, you know I’m gonna do the craziest shit

2:15:51.889,2:15:52.889
in there.

2:15:52.889,2:15:56.110
Log: The problem I have is I’ll get something,
I’ll put in

2:15:56.110,2:15:59.520
the freezer, I’ll determine, “Okay, today’s
the day that I’m gonna use this,”

2:15:59.520,2:16:05.639
so the day—the night before I take it out
of the freezer, put it in the fridge.

2:16:05.639,2:16:08.230
And then, that day I take it out and it’s
still frozen.

2:16:08.230,2:16:09.510
Gir: You gotta put it in warm water.

2:16:09.510,2:16:11.449
Trog: You gotta put it in two days in advance.

2:16:11.449,2:16:14.770
Log: It’s just a-it’s a load of shit.
They-they tell you to

2:16:14.770,2:16:20.271
do one thing, but the-their way—there’s
a universal way to unfreeze it and they

2:16:20.271,2:16:21.400
always tell you otherwise.

2:16:21.400,2:16:22.400
[Gir laughs]

2:16:22.400,2:16:24.090
Log: It’s shit, it’s just stupid.

2:16:24.090,2:16:27.230
Gir: Somethin’ about that just tickled me
so bad. Just Log

2:16:27.230,2:16:31.040
being mad that meat didn’t unfreeze and
calling it a load of shit [laughs].

2:16:31.040,2:16:33.019
Log: Yeah, they always tell you to thaw it
out in the

2:16:33.019,2:16:35.820
fridge, but thawin’ it out in the fridge
takes so long. It takes too long.

2:16:35.820,2:16:38.719
Trog: Yeah, I hate thawing food, that shit’s
sucks.

2:16:38.719,2:16:41.260
Log: Like whatever. Just take it out and just
put it on the

2:16:41.260,2:16:43.580
counter four hours before, and then it’s
good.

2:16:43.580,2:16:44.580
Gir: No, like if you get something—

2:16:44.580,2:16:45.710
Log: But I try to play by the rules—

2:16:45.710,2:16:48.650
Gir: Put it in warm-a warm bowl of water.

2:16:48.650,2:16:49.650
[Log sputters]

2:16:49.650,2:16:51.099
Gir: Not hot, but warm.

2:16:51.099,2:16:53.010
Log: I don’t have a good bowl for this.

2:16:53.010,2:16:54.010
Trog: Keep it in your mouth.

2:16:54.010,2:16:55.389
Gir: Do you have a sink?

2:16:55.389,2:16:58.859
Log: …I’m not gonna put it in the sink.

2:16:58.859,2:17:00.830
Gir: Oh my god, then don’t complain.

2:17:00.830,2:17:03.670
Log: I’m—[sighs] what do you think I’m
gonna do? Just put it

2:17:03.670,2:17:05.200
in-just at the bottom of the sink?

2:17:05.200,2:17:08.171
Gir: Yes! You plug the sink, set the meat
in there, put in

2:17:08.171,2:17:09.620
some water, and let it thaw!

2:17:09.620,2:17:10.620
Log: Gross.

2:17:10.620,2:17:13.429
Gir: Oh my god [laughs]! There’s nothin’
wrong with that!

2:17:13.429,2:17:15.550
Wayne: Nothin’ wrong with that! That’s
what you gotta do!

2:17:15.550,2:17:18.469
Log: I know my way around it, and I come through
at the end.

2:17:18.469,2:17:19.469
[Gir laughs]

2:17:19.469,2:17:22.389
Baaulp: I think we’re—I-we’re talking
about defrosting meat

2:17:22.389,2:17:25.660
now, I-I-this shit’s over, this shit’s
over!

2:17:25.660,2:17:29.870
Trog: Yeah, I think maybe it’s—I think
it’s time to fucking

2:17:29.870,2:17:32.400
mercy kill this goddamn podcast already.

2:17:32.400,2:17:33.400
[Wayne laughs]

2:17:33.400,2:17:35.580
Log: Whatever. You-make your-make your decision.

2:17:35.580,2:17:39.519
Wayne: Have we talked about, uh-I just got
this new fruit

2:17:39.519,2:17:40.519

2:17:40.519,2:17:41.519
Trog: Yeah.

2:17:41.519,2:17:43.349
Log: Come on, man.

2:17:43.349,2:17:46.639
Wayne: I spray the fruit and it gets all the
pesticides off.

2:17:46.639,2:17:51.240
I… I’ve been separating the darks from
the brights in my washer.

2:17:51.240,2:17:52.729
Gir, muttering: Nobody does that anymore.

2:17:52.729,2:17:56.080
Trog: Let’s do an outro where we each say
one word at a

2:17:56.080,2:17:57.080
time.

2:17:57.080,2:18:01.500
Wayne: Let’s go me, Gir, Trog, Log, Baaulp.
Okay? Alright.

2:18:01.500,2:18:02.740
Wayne: Thanks.

2:18:02.740,2:18:04.590
Gir, simultaneously: Bye.

2:18:04.590,2:18:07.059
[A pause of silence]

2:18:07.059,2:18:08.290
[Everyone laughs]

2:18:08.290,2:18:09.530
Gir: [Unintelligible]

2:18:09.530,2:18:13.399
Trog: Ah shit, that’s good, but we can’t-we
have to-we have

2:18:13.399,2:18:14.950
to do our plugs.

2:18:14.950,2:18:17.939
Wayne: That was good, but, yeah, let’s do
the plugs and then

2:18:17.939,2:18:24.200
we’ll do this. Okay, so anyways, y’know,
it’s been three months and the question,

2:18:24.200,2:18:28.340
it never stops arising, we don’t know where
to begin these podcasts, but we

2:18:28.340,2:18:33.130
always know how to end ‘em. This uh, if
you want to ask us a question for the

Baaulp: Yeah. And we pick the best, most interesting
ones.

2:18:55.719,2:18:56.719
Trog: Yeah.

2:18:56.719,2:18:58.160
Wayne: Mhmm. Like best-by date questions.

2:18:58.160,2:19:00.740
Trog: It’s a fuckin’ brown bag.

2:19:00.740,2:19:04.900
Wayne: Uh, if you wanna see more of what we’re
doing outside

2:19:04.900,2:19:10.030

Twitch Team. You can find me twitch.tv/wayneradiotv,

productions go on we talked about,

2:19:15.710,2:19:18.290
like the AI-dventure Call stream and the-the
gorilla stream.

2:19:18.290,2:19:20.000
Trog: [Crosstalk] Great gorilla stream.

2:19:20.000,2:19:22.559
Wayne: But everybody doin’ somethin’!
Gir, what’re you doing

Gir: Uh, everywhere you can find me just by
searching MasterGir.

2:19:26.260,2:19:29.510
Twitch, Twitter, YouTube, like all of it.

2:19:29.510,2:19:32.670
Baaulp: Same thing for me, except it’s Baaulp,
B-A-A-U-L-P,

2:19:32.670,2:19:40.240
I just put out a new video last week, the
second episode of my talk show. Uh, maybe

2:19:40.240,2:19:43.639
I’ll get a real talk show one day, but until
then I have make on in my living

2:19:43.639,2:19:49.189

Trog: I have a Twitch channel as well, uh,
it is

2:20:02.040,2:20:11.690
twitch.tv/Tr0g because Trog was already taken,
so I-I had to do a zero. Maybe

2:20:11.690,2:20:13.710
someday I can get the URL.

2:20:13.710,2:20:16.069
Wayne: It’s a damn shame. Give Trog his
name!

2:20:16.069,2:20:18.540
Trog: Yeah I don’t know, I don’t know
how many viewers or

2:20:18.540,2:20:22.780
subscribers I need to steal somebody else’s
name, but let’s try to get me there.

2:20:22.780,2:20:25.380
Wayne: Maybe I can get enough to do it for
you, like to get

2:20:25.380,2:20:26.380

2:20:26.380,2:20:30.840
Trog: And then I’m also on Twitter, and
that’s Trogort,

2:20:30.840,2:20:38.010
T-R-O-G-O-R-T, it’s like a little palindrome.
Um, yeah, I-I stream, we all

2:20:38.010,2:20:43.510
stream, everybody streams nowadays. Sometimes
video games, sometimes crosswords.

2:20:43.510,2:20:47.160

the RadioTVSolutions team. All nine

2:20:55.811,2:20:58.830
Wayne: Uh, but anyways, how about we do our
little thing?

2:20:58.830,2:21:00.142

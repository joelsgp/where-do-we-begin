0:00:18.340,0:00:26.320
Wayne: Y’know I’m-I’m fed up.

0:00:26.320,0:00:29.510
I’m mad.

0:00:29.510,0:00:34.110
I’m—I don’t get it, I’m frustrated.

0:00:34.110,0:00:36.120
Why haven’t we figured this out yet?

0:00:36.120,0:00:37.370
Where do we begin?

0:00:37.370,0:00:40.640
You’d think we’d know, what ep-what episode
are we on?

0:00:40.640,0:00:42.079
Baaulp: Uh, this would be—

0:00:42.079,0:00:43.079
Trog: Two.

0:00:43.079,0:00:44.079
Baaulp: —episode…

0:00:44.079,0:00:45.079
Yeah, two.

0:00:45.079,0:00:46.079
Wayne: We’ve done two of these and we don’t
know!

0:00:46.079,0:00:49.090
Baaulp: Hold on, I can find the real number.

0:00:49.090,0:00:50.610
It is episode eighteen.

0:00:50.610,0:00:54.220
Wayne: This is episode eighteen, and I’m
Wayne.

0:00:54.220,0:00:56.270
Trog: I’m Trog.

0:00:56.270,0:00:57.270
Log: And I’m Log.

0:00:57.270,0:00:58.270
Baaulp: I’m Baaulp.

0:00:58.270,0:00:59.270
Gir: And I’m Gir.

0:00:59.270,0:01:00.270
Wayne: How does it feel to be eighteen, guys?

0:01:00.270,0:01:01.270
We can smoke cigarettes now!

0:01:01.270,0:01:02.270
Yeah!

0:01:02.270,0:01:03.270
Baaulp: No, we can’t.

0:01:03.270,0:01:04.270
Gir: No, it’s—

0:01:04.270,0:01:05.270
Wayne: Gir, you got that lighter?

0:01:05.270,0:01:06.270
Gir: No, the age got bumped to twenty-one.

0:01:06.270,0:01:07.270
Wayne: Did it?

0:01:07.270,0:01:08.270
Oh, it did!

0:01:08.270,0:01:09.270
Gir: It did, yeah [laughs].

0:01:09.270,0:01:10.270
Log: When did that happen?

0:01:10.270,0:01:11.270
Wayne: Yes!

0:01:11.270,0:01:12.270
Score for healthy lungs, fuck yeah.

0:01:12.270,0:01:13.270
Log: That’s weird.

0:01:13.270,0:01:14.270
Gir: Is it?

0:01:14.270,0:01:15.270
Log: I don’t know.

0:01:15.270,0:01:16.270
Wayne: Is that countrywide?

0:01:16.270,0:01:17.270
Gir: It’s countrywide, yes.

0:01:17.270,0:01:18.270
It’s a national law.

0:01:18.270,0:01:19.270
Wayne: Shit.

0:01:19.270,0:01:20.270
Log: How did we pick twenty-one?

0:01:20.270,0:01:22.810
Trog: Y’know, I’ve thought about that,
and I don’t have an answer.

0:01:22.810,0:01:24.120
Wayne: It’s your brain.

0:01:24.120,0:01:27.500
Isn’t it—that’s like, that’s when
the brain is considered mostly developed.

0:01:27.500,0:01:28.500
Baaulp: I don’t know, that’s a—

0:01:28.500,0:01:29.500
Gir: It is, yeah.

0:01:29.500,0:01:31.470
That’s the average age of when the brain
finishes development.

0:01:31.470,0:01:35.290
Wayne: I think that’s actually not true,
though, I believe it goes up to like, twenty-five.

0:01:35.290,0:01:37.010
Trog: Yeah, there’s no way that’s accurate.

0:01:37.010,0:01:43.720
Baaulp: I heard that there was research that
said like, you reach your peak mentally—not

0:01:43.720,0:01:45.070
physically, mentally—at thirty-five.

0:01:45.070,0:01:51.700
So, I actually can’t wait, I got like, I’m
about to like, my brain is about to go into

0:01:51.700,0:01:52.700
overdrive.

0:01:52.700,0:01:56.740
Log: Alright, no smoking, no drinking, we
have a decade left.

0:01:56.740,0:01:57.740
[Baaulp laughs]

0:01:57.740,0:02:00.240
Gir: Uh, I can already tell I’ve peaked
mentally.

0:02:00.240,0:02:01.409
Baaulp: Aw, come on.

0:02:01.409,0:02:03.740
Wayne: I am definitely on the downswing.

0:02:03.740,0:02:09.810
Trog: I’m twenty-seven, and whenever I think
back to me at twenty-one I’m like, “There’s

0:02:09.810,0:02:14.300
no way that my brain was fully developed when
I was twenty-one years old,” like—

0:02:14.300,0:02:15.680
Baaulp: Yeah, that’s what I—same.

0:02:15.680,0:02:16.680
Same.

0:02:16.680,0:02:18.890
Wayne: I misspoke, and I think what it’s
more-what it’s moreso is that your brain

0:02:18.890,0:02:23.730
has developed enough that the-the effects
of alcohol and cigarettes should not—note

0:02:23.730,0:02:26.319
the word should—should not do lasting damage.

0:02:26.319,0:02:27.319
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:02:27.319,0:02:28.319
Wayne: And that’s how they do it.

0:02:28.319,0:02:32.010
Gir: It’s not like mentally develop, it’s
physically—like your brains not physically

0:02:32.010,0:02:34.430
getting any larger, that’s what it is.

0:02:34.430,0:02:35.430
Trog: Speak for yourself.

0:02:35.430,0:02:36.430
Wayne: [Laughs] I don’t know…

0:02:36.430,0:02:37.430
Gir: You’re still stupid.

0:02:37.430,0:02:39.760
You’re still stupid and you’re still learning,
but your brain’s not getting much bigger.

0:02:39.760,0:02:41.410
Wayne: I bet we’re all wrong.

0:02:41.410,0:02:46.060
I bet there’s someone here—there’s a
fuckin’ craniologist in here listenin’

0:02:46.060,0:02:47.060
to this podcast—

0:02:47.060,0:02:48.060
Baaulp: Screaming.

0:02:48.060,0:02:50.640
They’re listening to this podcast in their
office and they’re screaming, they’re

0:02:50.640,0:02:55.280
like, throwing shit around like, “I can’t
believe these idiots, they’re so stupid.”

0:02:55.280,0:02:56.280
[Wayne laughs]

0:02:56.280,0:03:00.599
Gir: Send me an email if you think we’re
wrong, and I’ll uh, tell you to fuck off.

0:03:00.599,0:03:01.599
Baaulp: [Laughs] Wow, okay.

0:03:01.599,0:03:02.599
Trog: Oh, alright.

0:03:02.599,0:03:03.599
[Gir laughs]

0:03:03.599,0:03:05.950
Trog: I don’t even look at the emails, so…

0:03:05.950,0:03:12.450
Baaulp: This person—this person’s an intelligent
listener, this hypothetical listener’s very

0:03:12.450,0:03:14.099
intelligent, a valuable member—

0:03:14.099,0:03:15.099
Log: Thirty-five years old?

0:03:15.099,0:03:16.099
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:03:16.099,0:03:17.750
Like why are you gonna tell them to fuck off?

0:03:17.750,0:03:21.599
Log: Thirty-five years old, their brain has
grown to its peak.

0:03:21.599,0:03:22.599
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:03:22.599,0:03:23.970
Log: Now it’s gonna shrink.

0:03:23.970,0:03:27.700
It’s gonna shrink after they send the email,
so have some respect.

0:03:27.700,0:03:28.780
Gir: How are you gonna tell me I’m wrong?

0:03:28.780,0:03:29.780
You’re in decline, fucker.

0:03:29.780,0:03:31.670
Log: What are you talking about?

0:03:31.670,0:03:32.670
I’m on the rise.

0:03:32.670,0:03:33.980
Gir: [Crosstalk] I don’t know—Not you.

0:03:33.980,0:03:35.409
Log: Who’s thirty-five?

0:03:35.409,0:03:37.200
Gir: The hypothetical person.

0:03:37.200,0:03:42.050
Wayne: I think—Listen, listen, I think like,
my life is on the upswing, things are gettin’

0:03:42.050,0:03:45.780
better, they’re always getting better, but
I think my brain is absolutely on the downswing.

0:03:45.780,0:03:48.500
It is absolutely decaying day by day.

0:03:48.500,0:03:50.700
Every video game I play I lose like .5 IQ.

0:03:50.700,0:03:51.700
Gir: Hmm.

0:03:51.700,0:03:55.010
Log: I don’t know, you said Spookstablost
like four years ago, so it’s only up from

0:03:55.010,0:03:56.010
there.

0:03:56.010,0:04:00.710
Wayne: Yesterday-yester—No, yesterday I
tried to tell Scorpy that I needed to rerecord

0:04:00.710,0:04:06.040
like, a consent line for the voice changer—the
voice synthesis thing we’ve been using,

0:04:06.040,0:04:10.200
and I was like, not thinking, and I said,
“Yeah, I’ve gotta rerecord the….

0:04:10.200,0:04:11.640
Fat… fart…”

0:04:11.640,0:04:12.750
I didn’t mean to say that.

0:04:12.750,0:04:13.750
[Baaulp laughs]

0:04:13.750,0:04:15.659
Gir: Let me, let me help you out, ‘cause
I was also there.

0:04:15.659,0:04:16.659
Baaulp: Oh, man.

0:04:16.659,0:04:19.630
Gir: You said, “I have to rerecord the fat
fart,” you meant to say, “the first part,”

0:04:19.630,0:04:21.859
and your brain just went on a completely different
path.

0:04:21.859,0:04:22.859
Wayne, laughing: Yeah!

0:04:22.859,0:04:24.980
Gir: Your brain was like, “F…fuh…f-haha,
fat fart.”

0:04:24.980,0:04:30.070
Trog: I don’t understand though, Wayne,
I mean, you are playing Brain Age every day,

0:04:30.070,0:04:31.070
right?

0:04:31.070,0:04:32.070
Wayne: No?

0:04:32.070,0:04:34.350
Baaulp: Oh yeah, that’s a-that’s a—Yeah,
that’s what me and Trog are doin’.

0:04:34.350,0:04:35.350
Trog: That’s important.

0:04:35.350,0:04:36.350
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:04:36.350,0:04:37.350
Wayne: I’ve been letting the doctor down.

0:04:37.350,0:04:40.610
Trog: I mean, I don’t think I’ve never
not played Brain Age every single day since

0:04:40.610,0:04:41.610
it came out and now I’m in Mensa.

0:04:41.610,0:04:42.610
Baaulp: I play every day.

0:04:42.610,0:04:43.610
Wayne: What’s your brain age?

0:04:43.610,0:04:44.610
Trog: …Two.

0:04:44.610,0:04:45.610
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:04:45.610,0:04:46.610
I’m three.

0:04:46.610,0:04:48.160
Wayne: I think it’s supposed to be higher
at this point.

0:04:48.160,0:04:49.770
Trog: No, it’s ‘cause the lower the better.

0:04:49.770,0:04:50.770
Baaulp: What?

0:04:50.770,0:04:51.770
No, it’s like golf.

0:04:51.770,0:04:52.770
You want it lower.

0:04:52.770,0:04:53.770
Trog: Yeah, it’s like golf scores.

0:04:53.770,0:04:54.850
Wayne: Every time I ask you for a number in
this podcast, Trog, are you just gonna say

0:04:54.850,0:04:55.850
two?

0:04:55.850,0:04:56.850
‘Cause you’re on a roll right now.

0:04:56.850,0:04:58.520
Trog: It’s the funniest number I have.

0:04:58.520,0:05:01.280
Wayne, singing: [In the tune of “One is
the Loneliest Number”] Two is the funniest

0:05:01.280,0:05:03.530
number since the number one!

0:05:03.530,0:05:07.729
Log: We asked you to write the answers to
these math problems and you drew pictures

0:05:07.729,0:05:09.000
with childlike wonder.

0:05:09.000,0:05:10.000
[Wayne laughs]

0:05:10.000,0:05:11.390
Log: I think your brain is very young.

0:05:11.390,0:05:12.670
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:05:12.670,0:05:13.840
Wayne: Wonder and merriment.

0:05:13.840,0:05:15.050
Gir: Wonder and joy.

0:05:15.050,0:05:16.050
[Baaulp laughs]

0:05:16.050,0:05:19.830
Wayne: We asked Trog to recount the quadratic
formula and received a picture of a car with

0:05:19.830,0:05:20.830
two wheels.

0:05:20.830,0:05:21.910
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

0:05:21.910,0:05:25.479
Trog: Is that not just a bicycle or a motorcycle?

0:05:25.479,0:05:29.690
Gir: You can have only two wheels on a car,
it’s called not putting all four on.

0:05:29.690,0:05:32.160
Trog: I guess, I mean you wouldn’t go very
fast.

0:05:32.160,0:05:36.520
Wayne: That is the go-to way—That is the
go-to way for a kid to draw a car, like they

0:05:36.520,0:05:38.289
don’t consider that you would need to see—

0:05:38.289,0:05:39.479
Trog: Yeah.

0:05:39.479,0:05:40.479
Like a side profile.

0:05:40.479,0:05:41.479
Wayne: Yeah.

0:05:41.479,0:05:43.540
Like a 2D profile, like a bisected car, where
you see just the two wheels.

0:05:43.540,0:05:44.540
Gir: Uh-huh.

0:05:44.540,0:05:47.669
Wayne: Y’know, I specifically remember being
a kid and like, drawing all my shit like that

0:05:47.669,0:05:52.639
and like, drawing animals with just the two
little legs, and then learning like, “Oh,

0:05:52.639,0:05:58.480
if you draw like—If you draw like—at the
bottom of the animal you just draw the two

0:05:58.480,0:06:03.440
legs coming from behind, that you can depict
a slight perspective in a 2D space,” and

0:06:03.440,0:06:04.840
it like, blew my mind.

0:06:04.840,0:06:06.590
And then all my creatures had four legs.

0:06:06.590,0:06:07.590
Trog: Oh, hell yeah.

0:06:07.590,0:06:08.590
Wayne: And I was like, “Yeah.”

0:06:08.590,0:06:09.590
Baaulp: Even snakes.

0:06:09.590,0:06:10.590
[Wayne laughs]

0:06:10.590,0:06:13.160
Gir: That reminds me, the first time-the first
time as a child, like, when I’m in like

0:06:13.160,0:06:19.139
a art class at school or something and I like
finally got—grasped the concept of what

0:06:19.139,0:06:26.919
perspective is, I drew like a really nice
hallway, never once have I drawn perspective

0:06:26.919,0:06:28.470
that well again [laughs].

0:06:28.470,0:06:30.720
I had that flash and then it was just gone.

0:06:30.720,0:06:32.759
Wayne: Gir’s art magnum opus.

0:06:32.759,0:06:33.759
It happened early.

0:06:33.759,0:06:35.960
Log: You cleared the dark ages at age six.

0:06:35.960,0:06:36.960
Trog: Yeah.

0:06:36.960,0:06:37.960
[Wayne laughs]

0:06:37.960,0:06:40.210
Gir: Yeah, no, that’s exactly how Da Vinci
felt and then it’s just gone.

0:06:40.210,0:06:45.410
Wayne: I mean, you just drew that like, happy
emote like a week ago, and that was great.

0:06:45.410,0:06:46.410
I think you’ve resurfaced.

0:06:46.410,0:06:47.410
Gir: Ehh, true.

0:06:47.410,0:06:49.240
Baaulp: Hold on, hold on, hold on.

0:06:49.240,0:06:53.810
Log just referred to like, that period when
you’re a dumb kid as the dark ages.

0:06:53.810,0:06:54.950
Gir: It is!

0:06:54.950,0:06:55.950
Wayne: No!

0:06:55.950,0:06:57.290
He’s talking about the artistic dark ages.

0:06:57.290,0:06:58.290
Trog: Yeah.

0:06:58.290,0:07:01.022
Log: Yeah, I was referring to the time period
between the fall of the Roman empire—

0:07:01.022,0:07:02.022
Baaulp: Oh.

0:07:02.022,0:07:03.022
Wayne: Pre-Renaissance.

0:07:03.022,0:07:05.100
Log: —and the Renaissance era where people
just collectively forgot 3 dimensions and

0:07:05.100,0:07:08.220
perspective and the fact that humans are not
the same size as buildings.

0:07:08.220,0:07:09.220
[Wayne laughs]

0:07:09.220,0:07:11.250
Baaulp: Jokes on you ‘cause now I can—that’s
my idea.

0:07:11.250,0:07:13.690
Growing up is now called the little dark ages.

0:07:13.690,0:07:14.690
[Log laughs]

0:07:14.690,0:07:15.910
Wayne: Little dark ages.

0:07:15.910,0:07:19.830
That’s when they forgot that dogs didn’t
have human faces.

0:07:19.830,0:07:21.630
Log: Some artists still don’t know.

0:07:21.630,0:07:22.940
Wayne: What happened?

0:07:22.940,0:07:26.850
The dark ages couldn’t have been that bad,
that they forgot all that shit.

0:07:26.850,0:07:27.850
Log: They forgot everything!

0:07:27.850,0:07:29.169
Wayne, laughing: Oh, man.

0:07:29.169,0:07:35.240
Baaulp: You have to think of like-you have
to think like—Like, okay, ‘cause what

0:07:35.240,0:07:40.050
happened was, I mean you can look up the history
books, I-I think it would be too long to explain

0:07:40.050,0:07:44.400
how they got to the dark ages, but you have
to think about the scenario, which is like,

0:07:44.400,0:07:50.800
“Oh, shit, like, we have no more books anymore,
like the things that we all wrote down to

0:07:50.800,0:07:51.870
remember all those good shit—”

0:07:51.870,0:07:52.870
Wayne: Shit got destroyed.

0:07:52.870,0:07:53.870
Baaulp: —Yeah, “It’s all gone.”

0:07:53.870,0:07:59.460
Wayne: I know the history, it’s just a crazy
thing to fathom, like, so much—For a second

0:07:59.460,0:08:01.410
dark ages to happen, imagine that.

0:08:01.410,0:08:03.920
The fuckin’ Internet would have to be wiped,
the fuckin’—

0:08:03.920,0:08:10.550
Baaulp: The way I see it is like, okay, imagine
if the Internet just went away.

0:08:10.550,0:08:16.790
Like you rely-we all rely on the Internet
so much nowadays, imagine if it went away,

0:08:16.790,0:08:19.660
everybody would be just fuckin’ winging
it.

0:08:19.660,0:08:21.870
Because society has to go on, what are you
gonna do?

0:08:21.870,0:08:23.139
Not grow food?

0:08:23.139,0:08:24.139
Not eat?

0:08:24.139,0:08:29.980
But it’s like, “Oh shit, I have to do-I
have a presentation for this-for my job tomorrow,

0:08:29.980,0:08:36.120
well, I  no longer have PowerPoint, I no
longer have Internet, all the records for

0:08:36.120,0:08:42.700
y’know, the sales for all of last year are
gone, I’m-I’m reduced to like scrawling

0:08:42.700,0:08:47.450
on a chalk board tellin’ my-the CEO like,
uh, I think it was good last year.”

0:08:47.450,0:08:51.870
Log: Yeah, the Internet went away but com-that
means computers don’t work anymore, the

0:08:51.870,0:08:53.050
Internet is gone.

0:08:53.050,0:08:54.550
You can’t use programs anymore.

0:08:54.550,0:08:58.780
Wayne: I try to log onto Twitter only to receive
an error that the entire Internet has been

0:08:58.780,0:08:59.780
disconnected.

0:08:59.780,0:09:02.330
I immediately start to cry and draw a human
with the face of a muttonchop.

0:09:02.330,0:09:03.330
[Baaulp laughs]

0:09:03.330,0:09:07.160
Log: I think a medieval peasant’s brain
would probably would’ve peaked like five

0:09:07.160,0:09:11.899
hundred years in the past, so they shouldn’t
have ever drank or smoked.

0:09:11.899,0:09:15.030
Gir: They smoked uh, little bit crazier shit
than we smoke.

0:09:15.030,0:09:16.279
Baaulp: Yeah, like crystals.

0:09:16.279,0:09:21.410
Wayne: God, I hope whenever we get like, proper
cloning tech going we use that to bring back

0:09:21.410,0:09:24.000
like, revive a bunch of peasants and like,
fuck with them.

0:09:24.000,0:09:25.000
That’d be awesome.

0:09:25.000,0:09:26.000
[Baaulp laughs]

0:09:26.000,0:09:27.000
Gir: I think there should be like a high school.

0:09:27.000,0:09:28.420
Trog: Now where are you going to get this
peasant DNA from?

0:09:28.420,0:09:32.760
Wayne: I wanna show them like, CGI of like,
dragons.

0:09:32.760,0:09:36.490
And like, put them in VR with a dragon in
front of them.

0:09:36.490,0:09:40.519
Baaulp: [Laughs] Wait, wait, wait, they-what
do you-what do you mean peasant DNA?

0:09:40.519,0:09:42.070
That’s our DNA you’re just—[Laughs].

0:09:42.070,0:09:44.720
Wayne: [Laughs] No, go find their bones!

0:09:44.720,0:09:46.760
You gotta go find their bones, pull their
bones out of the ground, and [laughs].

0:09:46.760,0:09:50.790
Trog: Would you be able to recognize a peasant’s
bones, though?

0:09:50.790,0:09:53.260
Like, “Oh, these bones look poor.”

0:09:53.260,0:09:54.260
Wayne: Yes!

0:09:54.260,0:09:56.610
He’d have the-he’d have the-they-it would
be in like a thatched roof cottage, and it

0:09:56.610,0:09:59.180
would have like a burlap sack on it’s head,
and like [laughs].

0:09:59.180,0:10:00.180
[Log, Trog, and Baaulp laugh]

0:10:00.180,0:10:02.110
Log: It’d be a perfectly preserved skeleton
eating just—

0:10:02.110,0:10:03.110
Gir: Bread.

0:10:03.110,0:10:04.110
Log: Gruel.

0:10:04.110,0:10:05.110
Trog: Eating a mutton.

0:10:05.110,0:10:07.380
Log: Holding a-holding a fossilized bowl of
gruel.

0:10:07.380,0:10:08.380
Trog: Yeah.

0:10:08.380,0:10:09.380
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

0:10:09.380,0:10:10.490
Wayne: Have a pitchfork.

0:10:10.490,0:10:12.589
Trog: Can’t wait till we can clown our own
serf.

0:10:12.589,0:10:13.589
[Wayne laughs]

0:10:13.589,0:10:17.140
Log: I think we should revive a medieval knight
and ask them about the giant snails that they

0:10:17.140,0:10:18.140
fought.

0:10:18.140,0:10:19.140
Wayne: Oh, man.

0:10:19.140,0:10:21.790
Baaulp: Y’know-y’know, you’re interested
in that era of time, I’m interested in the

0:10:21.790,0:10:25.980
seventies, I want—One day we’re gonna
be able to harvest hippie DNA and revive a

0:10:25.980,0:10:27.580
hippie and ask it about Woodstock.

0:10:27.580,0:10:28.580
[Wayne laughs]

0:10:28.580,0:10:29.580
Gir, laughing: Hippie DNA?

0:10:29.580,0:10:32.040
Log: Yeah, how come we haven’t revived a
hippie yet?

0:10:32.040,0:10:33.040
[Baaulp laughs]

0:10:33.040,0:10:34.470
Trog: Yeah, what happened to all those guys?

0:10:34.470,0:10:38.190
Wayne: We gotta go to like, ground zero for
Woodstock and like, dig up one of the bodies.

0:10:38.190,0:10:40.420
Log: How come we never revived a scene kid?

0:10:40.420,0:10:41.589
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

0:10:41.589,0:10:42.760
Trog: Same good question.

0:10:42.760,0:10:45.380
Wayne: Well, they still walk the earth, so
do the hippies!

0:10:45.380,0:10:48.810
We’re not at the point where we have to
do this, come like—When we’re still alive

0:10:48.810,0:10:52.140
like fifty years later, we can-then we can
look for the scene kids and the hippies.

0:10:52.140,0:10:55.710
Gir: I don’t think we should revive hippies,
they’re the reason the Beatniks went extinct.

0:10:55.710,0:10:56.710
Trog:  Damn.

0:10:56.710,0:10:57.710
Baaulp: Oh, no.

0:10:57.710,0:10:58.710
No, you’re right.

0:10:58.710,0:11:01.310
Trog: Yeah, we’d be introducing an invasive
species.

0:11:01.310,0:11:02.310
Gir: Yeah.

0:11:02.310,0:11:03.310
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

0:11:03.310,0:11:04.620
Trog: A little dangerous.

0:11:04.620,0:11:07.000
Gir: Evolution culled them for a reason.

0:11:07.000,0:11:09.040
Trog: Yeah, we’re playing God at that point.

0:11:09.040,0:11:11.700
Wayne: We weren’t playing God at reviving
peasants?

0:11:11.700,0:11:12.880
Trog: No, who cares.

0:11:12.880,0:11:13.880
[Gir laughs]

0:11:13.880,0:11:14.880
Wayne: That one was a—[Laughs] Who gives
a shit?

0:11:14.880,0:11:21.649
Baaulp: I think the element that you’re
forgetting is that back then—and this is

0:11:21.649,0:11:28.120
like the dumbest thing ever, like I don’t
know how like—I would love to ask a historian.

0:11:28.120,0:11:32.450
Yo, if you’re a historian and you listen
to this and you know about this era of time,

0:11:32.450,0:11:35.310
please let us know, ‘cause I’m dying to
know this question.

0:11:35.310,0:11:39.390
So, they didn’t know that boiling water
made it safe to drink.

0:11:39.390,0:11:43.760
They didn’t figure that out, but they were
like, “Oh, if you cook with water like,

0:11:43.760,0:11:48.820
boil it, or if you make beer with water that’s
safe, so what do we drink?

0:11:48.820,0:11:52.700
Uh, let’s just drink beer all the time instead
of water.

0:11:52.700,0:11:53.800
All the time.”

0:11:53.800,0:11:56.070
And so, like, I think that adds—

0:11:56.070,0:11:57.861
Wayne: Is that really the order?

0:11:57.861,0:11:58.861
That they figured that out?

0:11:58.861,0:12:00.510
Baaulp: I’m pretty sure, yeah!

0:12:00.510,0:12:02.570
Wayne: I-I don’t know.

0:12:02.570,0:12:06.870
I feel like they figured out boiling water
made it safe pretty early, I’m not sure.

0:12:06.870,0:12:07.870
Baaulp: No, no, no—

0:12:07.870,0:12:09.790
Gir: No, boiling water came later, for sure.

0:12:09.790,0:12:10.790
Yeah.

0:12:10.790,0:12:13.350
Baaulp: Not in Europe at least, I don’t
know about the rest of the world, but not

0:12:13.350,0:12:14.350
in Europe.

0:12:14.350,0:12:15.350
Wayne: Damn, damn.

0:12:15.350,0:12:16.350
No wonder.

0:12:16.350,0:12:17.350
No fuckin’ wonder.

0:12:17.350,0:12:19.800
Log: They might not even have known that drinking
beer was safe—

0:12:19.800,0:12:20.800
Gir: No, they knew.

0:12:20.800,0:12:21.800
[Baaulp laughs]

0:12:21.800,0:12:25.310
Log: —they just did it and the ones that
drank beer didn’t die so they kept doing

0:12:25.310,0:12:26.310
it.

0:12:26.310,0:12:27.310
Wayne: Well they’d get drunk and like, forget.

0:12:27.310,0:12:28.410
Gir: That’s how they knew it was safe.

0:12:28.410,0:12:32.500
It was like, “Oh, well this—this fucked
up funny drink is the one that’s not killing

0:12:32.500,0:12:33.860
everyone, let’s just keep drinking that.”

0:12:33.860,0:12:34.860
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:12:34.860,0:12:37.180
Log: How would they be aware of that happening
around them, though?

0:12:37.180,0:12:39.604
They drink their beer, they’re not gonna
know all the water drinkers died.

0:12:39.604,0:12:40.604
Gir: Trial and error.

0:12:40.604,0:12:42.959
Log: They-they didn’t even know what a dog’s
face looked like.

0:12:42.959,0:12:44.150
Gir: Trial and error!

0:12:44.150,0:12:47.420
Wayne: [Laughs] They didn’t even know how
tall a building was!

0:12:47.420,0:12:51.130
They thought if you saw a building from a
hundred feet away it was about the size of

0:12:51.130,0:12:52.130
a man!

0:12:52.130,0:12:53.820
Baaulp: Oh my god, we put two and two together!

0:12:53.820,0:12:55.430
No wonder they drew like that!

0:12:55.430,0:12:57.530
They were all sloshed all the time!

0:12:57.530,0:12:58.530
[Wayne laughs]

0:12:58.530,0:13:02.370
Trog: I feel like there are going to be historians
listening to this podcast and getting really

0:13:02.370,0:13:03.370
upset.

0:13:03.370,0:13:04.370
[Baaulp laughs]

0:13:04.370,0:13:07.600
Gir: There were like six hundred years of
like, trial and error on basically everything.

0:13:07.600,0:13:09.630
That’s how we ended up with cheese.

0:13:09.630,0:13:14.770
Wayne: Yeah, like the trial and error of any
element of cooking is like, insane to me.

0:13:14.770,0:13:15.770
Gir: Yeah.

0:13:15.770,0:13:18.190
Wayne: Like imagine to be the first person
to make-to cook a loaf of bread.

0:13:18.190,0:13:20.279
Like, you would have lost your shit.

0:13:20.279,0:13:22.600
Gir: [Laughs] The steps-the steps it takes
to make bread—

0:13:22.600,0:13:26.820
Wayne: You would have been hailed as a fucking
god if you were the first man to make a bread.

0:13:26.820,0:13:31.560
Log: There is no trial there, like-there was
no trial, it was just error and then happy.

0:13:31.560,0:13:32.560
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:13:32.560,0:13:33.560
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

0:13:33.560,0:13:34.560
Wayne: Error and happy.

0:13:34.560,0:13:37.260
Trog: Yeah, they just accidentally let this
bacteria on this gruel.

0:13:37.260,0:13:41.620
Wayne: We have a lot of trial and error video
games, like Dark Souls and what not, when

0:13:41.620,0:13:43.699
are we gonna get a error and happy video game?

0:13:43.699,0:13:44.699
[Baaulp laughs]

0:13:44.699,0:13:46.050
Log: That is the history of it, right?

0:13:46.050,0:13:47.050
Like—

0:13:47.050,0:13:48.050
Gir: It’s GMod.

0:13:48.050,0:13:52.399
Log: —a medieval peasant just pulled a MasterGir
and left wheat and water or something, and

0:13:52.399,0:13:53.399
just—

0:13:53.399,0:13:54.399
Trog: And tried to microwave it.

0:13:54.399,0:13:56.209
Log: Through sheer error it turned into bread.

0:13:56.209,0:13:58.170
Gir: And they tried-they microwaved it.

0:13:58.170,0:14:00.010
Log: Or-or-or a bread-like substance.

0:14:00.010,0:14:01.140
Wayne: But here’s the thing.

0:14:01.140,0:14:05.810
That peasant makes that mistake and does that,
and he gets his-and he gets his accident bread,

0:14:05.810,0:14:09.079
but then he has to figure out why the fuck
that happened and how he recreates it, and

0:14:09.079,0:14:10.079
like—

0:14:10.079,0:14:12.220
Baaulp: I don’t think they’d care, I think
they’d just immediately make more because

0:14:12.220,0:14:15.709
bread’s the best thing they’ve ever had
in their entire life!

0:14:15.709,0:14:20.430
Wayne: They just keep leaving out their bread
jank in bottles and gettin’ this awful,

0:14:20.430,0:14:21.430
awful bread.

0:14:21.430,0:14:22.430
Baaulp: Yeah!

0:14:22.430,0:14:23.430
Eventually they get the process down pat.

0:14:23.430,0:14:28.940
Y’know, maybe when they sober up and-after
they dehydrate and sober up just a little,

0:14:28.940,0:14:29.940
y’know?

0:14:29.940,0:14:32.670
Log: So, you get down to it, it’s error
and trial.

0:14:32.670,0:14:33.670
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:14:33.670,0:14:34.670
Yeah, basically.

0:14:34.670,0:14:35.670
Wayne: Fuck that.

0:14:35.670,0:14:36.670
Same shit.

0:14:36.670,0:14:37.670
Fuck you.

0:14:37.670,0:14:41.330
Gir: There’s been so many things throughout
human history where, “I wanted to make X,

0:14:41.330,0:14:44.060
but I got Y instead, but Y’s pretty good,
too.”

0:14:44.060,0:14:45.890
Baaulp: Think about it like this.

0:14:45.890,0:14:53.230
If I had to wager a guess, uh, pasta as we
know it probably had its origins start as

0:14:53.230,0:14:55.019
fucked up balls of dough and water.

0:14:55.019,0:14:56.019
They were like, “Hey!

0:14:56.019,0:15:00.130
You fucked up making your fucked-up doughball
water soup thing!

0:15:00.130,0:15:01.850
What—Oh, this is pretty good.

0:15:01.850,0:15:04.150
And it’s in a pleasing shape, let’s do
this instead!”

0:15:04.150,0:15:05.150
[Gir laughs]

0:15:05.150,0:15:06.470
Trog: How they invented penne.

0:15:06.470,0:15:07.470
Baaulp: [Laughs] Yeah!

0:15:07.470,0:15:09.540
But that’s so depressing to think about.

0:15:09.540,0:15:12.720
Gir: Hey, you fucked up making these Alpha-BIts,
it’s all O’s!

0:15:12.720,0:15:14.050
Hey, I have an idea.

0:15:14.050,0:15:15.050
Baaulp: Ohhh, ohhhh.

0:15:15.050,0:15:16.050
Gir: Let’s call ‘em—

0:15:16.050,0:15:17.259
Wayne: Gir, they didn’t even have the alphabet,
then.

0:15:17.259,0:15:19.410
Gir, laughing: They make me-they make me cheery!

0:15:19.410,0:15:21.350
Wayne: Pasta came before the alphabet.

0:15:21.350,0:15:25.750
Log: I like to imagine the accidental creation
of traditional Korean noodles, where they

0:15:25.750,0:15:28.829
just accidentally seesawed on some bread for
an hour.

0:15:28.829,0:15:30.610
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

0:15:30.610,0:15:36.260
Baaulp: Now the real brain genius is the person
who thought about eating spicy food.

0:15:36.260,0:15:38.070
“Oh, this hurt me!”

0:15:38.070,0:15:39.389
Gir: “I like it!”

0:15:39.389,0:15:41.830
Baaulp: “I’m gonna—Yeah, I want some
more.”

0:15:41.830,0:15:46.570
Wayne: I would love to tap into the mental
process of the first person to eat a really

0:15:46.570,0:15:47.790
spicy food.

0:15:47.790,0:15:51.959
Like, I mean, I think it’s more-it’s less
like, “Oh, this hurt me, but I like it!”

0:15:51.959,0:15:55.589
and more like, “Oh, this hurt me, but I’m
not hungry anymore and I feel fine, I’m

0:15:55.589,0:16:00.680
not like, I don’t have dysentery, I’m
not like, experiencing awful death diarrhea

0:16:00.680,0:16:01.779
from eating this pepper.”

0:16:01.779,0:16:06.690
Baaulp: [Laughs] “I feel the vitamins rushing
through my body, ‘cause this is the most

0:16:06.690,0:16:08.019
nutritious thing I’ve had in a week!”

0:16:08.019,0:16:11.440
Gir: That’s the thing, is your body can
tell there’s nutrients in there, so if it’s

0:16:11.440,0:16:16.170
not so hot that it like, makes you scream,
then you’re probably just gonna eat it,

0:16:16.170,0:16:17.170
anyway.

0:16:17.170,0:16:20.120
Wayne: No, now I’m imagining the first peasant
to eat a pepper just takes a bite and just,

0:16:20.120,0:16:21.120
“AAAUUUGHH!

0:16:21.120,0:16:22.120
EEUUH!”

0:16:22.120,0:16:23.120
Gir, in a nasally voice: “Aaahhhh!”

0:16:23.120,0:16:26.029
Baaulp: Y’know how like, if you’ve never
had a lot of spicy food before, and you eat

0:16:26.029,0:16:28.649
something even mildly spicy, it’s like really
hot to you?

0:16:28.649,0:16:34.060
Imagine you’re the first person to eat this
ever and it’s spicy [laughs].

0:16:34.060,0:16:35.060
Trog: Probably scary.

0:16:35.060,0:16:40.269
Wayne: The first person to experience capsaicin
on their tongue probably thought they were

0:16:40.269,0:16:41.269
dying.

0:16:41.269,0:16:42.420
[Baaulp laughs]

0:16:42.420,0:16:46.230
Gir: They didn’t know ‘cause they had
a fuckin’ early primate brain.

0:16:46.230,0:16:48.410
Baaulp: “Aaaahhh, a shaman cursed this berry!”

0:16:48.410,0:16:51.180
Wayne: Are you-are you telling me they didn’t
know what death was?

0:16:51.180,0:16:53.390
Which I mean, like, I guess, maybe.

0:16:53.390,0:16:58.389
Gir: No, they had a monkey brain and went,
“Ooh, pain bad, me no like pain.”

0:16:58.389,0:17:00.319
Wayne: “This pepper’s so hot I’m going
to sleep forever!

0:17:00.319,0:17:02.029
I don’t know what that is!”

0:17:02.029,0:17:03.450
[Trog, Gir, and Wayne laugh]

0:17:03.450,0:17:09.189
Log: The first Homo erectus emerged from the
primordial pool and immediately ate a jalapeno.

0:17:09.189,0:17:10.419
[Everyone laughs]

0:17:10.419,0:17:12.880
Gir: He just stands up and looks around.

0:17:12.880,0:17:15.600
Wayne: The first one to slither out of the
goop.

0:17:15.600,0:17:18.039
There’s a single pepper waiting for it!

0:17:18.039,0:17:19.250
Baaulp: “AAAAHHHH.

0:17:19.250,0:17:22.199
AN EVIL-AN EVIL NAUTILUS CURSED THIS BERRY!”

0:17:22.199,0:17:23.199
[Wayne laughs]

0:17:23.199,0:17:24.199
Trog: That’s like a time traveler prank.

0:17:24.199,0:17:25.810
Wayne, laughing: The time traveler’s prank!

0:17:25.810,0:17:30.810
Trog: The time traveler prank is, go back
in time to the first, uh, creature that could

0:17:30.810,0:17:32.890
walk upright and give it a pepper.

0:17:32.890,0:17:35.039
Just see what happens.

0:17:35.039,0:17:40.010
Wayne: [Laughs] Then you go-then you go back
to the modern time and humanity does not exist,

0:17:40.010,0:17:42.910
you literally fucked up the timeline that
bad.

0:17:42.910,0:17:43.910
Trog: Yeah, you ruined the time stream.

0:17:43.910,0:17:44.910
Wayne: One pepper’s all it takes.

0:17:44.910,0:17:49.750
Log: Well, when you think about how we like,
are now breeding the stuff for enhanced spiciness

0:17:49.750,0:17:53.710
and stuff, like you could just go back and
kill a serf with a Caroline Reaper.

0:17:53.710,0:17:54.710
Trog: Yeah.

0:17:54.710,0:17:56.980
Wayne: [Laughs] You give a serf a ghost pepper.

0:17:56.980,0:18:02.150
Trog: Those-I mean, those are basically weaponized
food, so.

0:18:02.150,0:18:03.150
Probably.

0:18:03.150,0:18:06.490
Baaulp: I have the opposite-I have the opposite
opinion.

0:18:06.490,0:18:11.980
I think it wouldn’t phase them at all because
if you like—One of my favorite things to

0:18:11.980,0:18:16.730
look at, like if I want a historical goof,
y’know, just laugh at some dumb people who

0:18:16.730,0:18:19.600
are already dead, what are they gonna do?

0:18:19.600,0:18:20.809
Beat me up?

0:18:20.809,0:18:23.230
I’m not going to heaven [laughs].

0:18:23.230,0:18:24.230
Trog: What?

0:18:24.230,0:18:25.250
Baaulp: Uh, [laughs]—

0:18:25.250,0:18:26.250
Gir: Okay.

0:18:26.250,0:18:27.250
[Wayne laughs]

0:18:27.250,0:18:35.110
Baaulp: Is to look up-is to look up Black
Plague cures, uh, this is the expensive cure.

0:18:35.110,0:18:38.760
Just buy emeralds, grind them up, and just
huff it.

0:18:38.760,0:18:43.570
Just like, throw-put emerald dust in a bag
and just huff that shit.

0:18:43.570,0:18:48.190
So I don’t think—I think it would hurt
them, I think we would get a reaction out

0:18:48.190,0:18:52.880
of them, but they’d be like, “Oh, this
really made me feel hot, like when I have

0:18:52.880,0:18:53.890
a fever.

0:18:53.890,0:18:55.510
Maybe this will cure the Black Plague!”

0:18:55.510,0:18:56.510
[Wayne laughs]

0:18:56.510,0:19:02.260
Gir: That’s the thing, is you can give some
like, poor serf uh, like a Carolina Reaper

0:19:02.260,0:19:05.730
and be like, “Hey, the more this hurts,
the less plague you have in you!

0:19:05.730,0:19:07.620
So just eat as many as you can, buddy!”

0:19:07.620,0:19:08.620
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:19:08.620,0:19:12.430
Wayne: What was a-what was a really—like,
name a really despicable monarch.

0:19:12.430,0:19:16.419
Trog: Um, you’re asking questions I’m
not prepared to answer.

0:19:16.419,0:19:18.039
Gir: Uh, Vlad the Impaler?

0:19:18.039,0:19:19.039
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:19:19.039,0:19:20.500
Wayne: No, not Vlad the Impaler.

0:19:20.500,0:19:22.240
Like—Oh, whatever.

0:19:22.240,0:19:25.310
Trog: I don’t know shit about history, my
man.

0:19:25.310,0:19:27.550
Baaulp: Yeah, I don’t know enough about
monarchs.

0:19:27.550,0:19:30.880
Wayne: Go—Okay, Queen Elizabeth, I don’t
know if she was good or bad, but we’re gonna

0:19:30.880,0:19:32.360
do this prank on her either way.

0:19:32.360,0:19:34.850
Trog, laughing: I don’t think she was that
bad, but I don’t know.

0:19:34.850,0:19:35.850
[Baaulp laughs]

0:19:35.850,0:19:36.850
Gir: The one that’s still alive?

0:19:36.850,0:19:39.900
The one that’s currently in the fucking
castle?

0:19:39.900,0:19:42.150
Wayne: [Laughs] No, not her!

0:19:42.150,0:19:43.220
No, no, not her!

0:19:43.220,0:19:44.220
Baaulp: Yeah, her.

0:19:44.220,0:19:45.220
Her!

0:19:45.220,0:19:46.220
Wayne: I’m not about to do this to her!

0:19:46.220,0:19:48.280
What I was gonna say is you go back in time,
go to some like, fucked up monarch, and dress

0:19:48.280,0:19:55.080
in like velvet robes and like, get gold lacing
and bring them a bong with a ghost pepper

0:19:55.080,0:19:56.679
in it and tell them to smoke it.

0:19:56.679,0:19:58.850
And tell them this will get them into heaven
for sure.

0:19:58.850,0:20:00.540
[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

0:20:00.540,0:20:02.890
Wayne: “I’m an angel, smoke this shit!”

0:20:02.890,0:20:05.850
Baaulp: “Yo bitch, I got your mandate sent
from heaven right here!”

0:20:05.850,0:20:08.549
Gir: Nah, I think it’s funnier to imagine
doing that to the current Queen.

0:20:08.549,0:20:12.720
Wayne: I guess you could do that to the current
Queen, she’s old enough, she’d fall for

0:20:12.720,0:20:13.720
it.

0:20:13.720,0:20:14.720
Gir: [In an old woman voice] “Okay!”

0:20:14.720,0:20:15.890
[Sucking sound, followed by old woman coughing]

0:20:15.890,0:20:16.890
[Wayne laughs]

0:20:16.890,0:20:17.890
Wayne: “Wow, an angel!”

0:20:17.890,0:20:18.890
[Baaulp laughs]

0:20:18.890,0:20:20.441
Wayne: And then she’d keep rippin’ it,
she’d Bogart that shit.

0:20:20.441,0:20:21.919
Gir: That would kill her.

0:20:21.919,0:20:23.720
That legitimately would kill her [laughs].

0:20:23.720,0:20:25.620
Trog: I think it’d make her stronger.

0:20:25.620,0:20:27.500
I think she would be too powerful; we’d
have to—

0:20:27.500,0:20:29.770
Wayne: [In a British accent] “The Queen
is Bogarting the bong!”

0:20:29.770,0:20:31.370
Baaulp: Hey, I wanna-I wanna—

0:20:31.370,0:20:32.740
Wayne: [In a British accent] “I say!”

0:20:32.740,0:20:37.809
Baaulp: Maybe it’s not the best to like,
hedge your bets but like, but I want to say,

0:20:37.809,0:20:40.780
best opening we’ve had so far to a podcast
[laughs]!

0:20:40.780,0:20:42.400
Wayne: [Laughs] I don’t know.

0:20:42.400,0:20:45.820
Trog: We are far past opening, this is-we’re
in the thick of it.

0:20:45.820,0:20:48.630
This is what we call the rising action of
the podcast.

0:20:48.630,0:20:50.650
Wayne: This is a main topic!

0:20:50.650,0:20:54.690
The whole time that we’ve been talking,
I’ve been staring at that fucking balloon

0:20:54.690,0:20:56.460
blast picture from last time.

0:20:56.460,0:20:58.070
Baaulp: Oh my god.

0:20:58.070,0:20:59.070
Trog: Why did we choose that?

0:20:59.070,0:21:00.070
Why did you choose that?

0:21:00.070,0:21:01.070
I’m pretty sure that was you.

0:21:01.070,0:21:02.679
Wayne: I found it and I thought it was great.

0:21:02.679,0:21:03.700
Trog: Alright.

0:21:03.700,0:21:04.700
Asked and answered.

0:21:04.700,0:21:06.990
Baaulp: Hey, it’s the thumbnail to the last
uh, last episode’s podcast, so—

0:21:06.990,0:21:09.890
Wayne: Y’know what, let’s make it the
thumbnail to this one, too.

0:21:09.890,0:21:11.450
Gir: That totally won’t be confusing!

0:21:11.450,0:21:12.990
Baaulp: I don’t know about that!

0:21:12.990,0:21:13.990
[Wayne laughs]

0:21:13.990,0:21:14.990
Baaulp: I don’t know.

0:21:14.990,0:21:15.990
Wayne: I think it’s a great gag.

0:21:15.990,0:21:16.990
I think that’s the best gag.

0:21:16.990,0:21:17.990
Baaulp: I don’t know, I don’t know…

0:21:17.990,0:21:20.630
Log: Yeah, just change the entire podcast
to be called Balloon Blast.

0:21:20.630,0:21:21.630
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:21:21.630,0:21:22.630
Wayne: Just-just mirror it!

0:21:22.630,0:21:23.630
Flip it!

0:21:23.630,0:21:24.630
Just flip it the other way!

0:21:24.630,0:21:25.630
Baaulp, laughing: Just flip it!

0:21:25.630,0:21:27.210
Gir: Just put a giant red 2 in the middle
of the image.

0:21:27.210,0:21:28.900
Wayne: Then it’ll be Tsalb Noollab.

0:21:28.900,0:21:29.900
Gir: Awesome.

0:21:29.900,0:21:32.850
Trog: Well, you have any other terrible ideas
to ruin our podcast?

0:21:32.850,0:21:34.050
Or should we move onto a new topic?

0:21:34.050,0:21:36.059
Wayne: I mean, it’s a great idea.

0:21:36.059,0:21:37.580
Baaulp: What have we been playing?

0:21:37.580,0:21:38.580
What have we been playing?

0:21:38.580,0:21:39.580
Wayne: Video games?

0:21:39.580,0:21:41.660
Baaulp: What have we been jamming out to,
anything!

0:21:41.660,0:21:42.660
Watchin’, playing, readin’…

0:21:42.660,0:21:43.660
Rippin’!

0:21:43.660,0:21:44.660
Wayne: I’ve been playing badminton and rugby.

0:21:44.660,0:21:45.770
Baaulp: Oh, oh boy.

0:21:45.770,0:21:46.770
Trog: By yourself?

0:21:46.770,0:21:48.010
Wayne: Yeah, in my room.

0:21:48.010,0:21:49.400
Gir: You can do badminton by yourself.

0:21:49.400,0:21:51.620
Baaulp: Hey, hey, I got this pepper, you wanna
eat it?

0:21:51.620,0:21:52.630
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:21:52.630,0:21:53.630
Trog: Yeah.

0:21:53.630,0:21:54.700
Wayne: You wanna play pepper, bro?

0:21:54.700,0:21:56.380
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

0:21:56.380,0:21:57.380
Gir: Play pepper.

0:21:57.380,0:21:58.880
Wayne, laughing: You wanna play peppers?

0:21:58.880,0:21:59.880
Trog: [Laughs] You—Yeah.

0:21:59.880,0:22:01.159
My new favorite game, peppers.

0:22:01.159,0:22:02.539
[Baaulp is still laughing, Wayne laughs again]

0:22:02.539,0:22:04.720
Gir: Hey, that’s my favorite friend!

0:22:04.720,0:22:09.470
Trog: Um, here’s something that you guys
have been playing that I have not been playing,

0:22:09.470,0:22:13.429
but I want to hear about it, and that is the
game called Fuser.

0:22:13.429,0:22:15.330
Which is like a little DJ game.

0:22:15.330,0:22:16.360
Baaulp: Oh, yes!

0:22:16.360,0:22:18.890
Trog: And that game looks like a lot of fun.

0:22:18.890,0:22:23.400
At the time of this recording, Scorpy, our
friend that you probably know if you’re

0:22:23.400,0:22:27.429
listening to this, did a stream of it last
night that I watched, and I was like, “Dang,

0:22:27.429,0:22:28.560
I gotta play this game.

0:22:28.560,0:22:29.940
This looks like so much fun.”

0:22:29.940,0:22:33.630
Gir: The short, sweet, and simple is: fun
game, cool mechanics, needs more songs.

0:22:33.630,0:22:35.060
Baaulp: Which it will have, it will get.

0:22:35.060,0:22:36.060
It will get.

0:22:36.060,0:22:37.060
Yeah.

0:22:37.060,0:22:41.260
Wayne: Needs more songs, but the songs are
like, extraordinarily expensive.

0:22:41.260,0:22:45.290
It’s like, if you want all the songs that
they release in a month, it’s seventy bucks

0:22:45.290,0:22:46.290
a month.

0:22:46.290,0:22:49.909
Trog:  That is pretty—I mean, here’s
the thing, so it’s Harmonix, right?

0:22:49.909,0:22:54.650
It’s the people who made Rock Band and the
early Guitar Heroes, like that’s how their

0:22:54.650,0:22:56.070
DLC has always worked.

0:22:56.070,0:23:01.370
They do not put out—Like, they put out a
lot of DLC with the idea that you’re just

0:23:01.370,0:23:03.960
going to pick what you like, you’re not
going to get all of it.

0:23:03.960,0:23:04.960
Gir: Yeah.

0:23:04.960,0:23:07.380
Wayne: Yeah, like it makes sense-it makes
sense, like, three-it’s three dollars a

0:23:07.380,0:23:09.520
song, three songs a week, or something like
that.

0:23:09.520,0:23:13.130
Or maybe it’s two dollars a song, I’m
not even sure, but yeah, you definitely just

0:23:13.130,0:23:14.550
want to buy the ones you’re familiar with.

0:23:14.550,0:23:19.179
Baaulp: What my opinion on it is that this
might be my game of the year, this year.

0:23:19.179,0:23:21.690
Like it is a very fun game.

0:23:21.690,0:23:28.299
It’s weird because it’s far from perfect,
I think the campaign like, uh, okay so, for

0:23:28.299,0:23:32.770
reference, to unlock all of your DJ abilities,
right?

0:23:32.770,0:23:35.770
Like, that’s the only way I know how to—

0:23:35.770,0:23:36.770
[Gir laughs]

0:23:36.770,0:23:45.100
Baaulp: To unlock all the DJ abilities like,
uh, like noi—Filters, or like, y’know,

0:23:45.100,0:23:47.641
the ability to lower or raise the volume,
you have to play through the campaign, right?

0:23:47.641,0:23:48.641
Wayne: Campaign sucks.

0:23:48.641,0:23:49.800
Gir: It does.

0:23:49.800,0:23:55.760
Baaulp: The campaign sucks, and the main reason,
to me at least, aside from the cutscenes,

0:23:55.760,0:23:56.990
which you can skip, right?

0:23:56.990,0:24:00.159
You can skip the cutscenes, if you think the
cutscene’s annoying just skip them.

0:24:00.159,0:24:05.020
But the campaign is weird, because they try
to gamify DJ elements.

0:24:05.020,0:24:07.130
And this game isn’t like a rhythm game,
right?

0:24:07.130,0:24:10.390
You’re not hitting notes to a beat, you’re
not-you’re not, yeah, you’re not hitting

0:24:10.390,0:24:12.500
buttons to a beat or anything.

0:24:12.500,0:24:17.610
You’re-it’s like, okay, you’re a DJ,
just do these things, fulfill these requests,

0:24:17.610,0:24:20.460
do these things, and it’s like, it struggles
at that.

0:24:20.460,0:24:23.690
It struggles at turning it into a game, right?

0:24:23.690,0:24:26.810
Where like, you get scored one-to-five, right?

0:24:26.810,0:24:28.670
One-to-five stars.

0:24:28.670,0:24:34.590
And what ends up happening is by the end of
the campaign they’ve loaded on so many different

0:24:34.590,0:24:36.350
mechanics, ‘cause there are a lot of mechanics,
right?

0:24:36.350,0:24:41.980
They do a good job of like, giving you the
essence of feeling like you’re a DJ, right?

0:24:41.980,0:24:46.390
But, they are expecting you to go so ham on
these mechanics that…

0:24:46.390,0:24:51.530
Scorpy put it—Scorpy hit it right on the
head, it sounds like you’re making YTPs,

0:24:51.530,0:24:52.669
‘cause it’s like—

0:24:52.669,0:24:53.669
[Trog laughs]

0:24:53.669,0:24:56.590
Baaulp: —“Okay, play-play-play y’know,
okay, play these instruments,” So I’m

0:24:56.590,0:25:01.750
like going, I’m like tabbing over to this
like, part of my HUD, I’m like, playing

0:25:01.750,0:25:06.789
3 notes on like a synth violin, moving on
because I need to throw down some like Sean

0:25:06.789,0:25:12.060
Paul to fulfill this other request, and then
I’m like, constantly muting and unmuting

0:25:12.060,0:25:16.620
tracks, it’s like, this is no longer music,
but I’m doing it and it’s giving me four

0:25:16.620,0:25:17.620
stars.

0:25:17.620,0:25:19.890
[Laughs] So it’s like, y’know, it’s
weird.

0:25:19.890,0:25:20.890
Log: Yeah.

0:25:20.890,0:25:26.280
It’s annoy—It keeps-it keeps asking you
to do something that’s bad, like it-like

0:25:26.280,0:25:31.340
the stars can align and it can just tell you
like, “Alright, uh, mute half your tracks.

0:25:31.340,0:25:32.860
Alright, you done with that?

0:25:32.860,0:25:33.990
Mute your other tracks.

0:25:33.990,0:25:38.280
Leave like one drum track on, and let that
play for like, ten seconds.”

0:25:38.280,0:25:43.370
Wayne: Because the act of like, mixing a DJ
set is very subjective, like-like the score

0:25:43.370,0:25:46.380
system might as well just be fucking random,
and I hate it.

0:25:46.380,0:25:47.380
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:25:47.380,0:25:49.340
Wayne: It’s like, I’ve got something good,
it’s like, “Alright!

0:25:49.340,0:25:51.700
Now use three discs from Macklemore’s Thrift
Shop!”

0:25:51.700,0:25:56.860
And I’m in like a fucking like-like R&B
set and I’m like, it’s just like, awful.

0:25:56.860,0:25:57.860
Gir: In a country set.

0:25:57.860,0:26:00.250
Wayne: And then you get the fuckin’ clown
saxophone [Wayne imitates the horn segment

0:26:00.250,0:26:04.620
of the song], which like, you can make work,
Scorpy’s-Scorpy’s proven that.

0:26:04.620,0:26:08.570
But the—And then, yeah, like Log’s said,
you’ll just be in the middle of a track

0:26:08.570,0:26:11.710
and it’ll be like, “Alright, now fade
out all of your instruments!”

0:26:11.710,0:26:13.559
And it’s like, I don’t-I don’t want
to do that!

0:26:13.559,0:26:16.380
And then you get someone in the crowd that’s
like, “I gotta hear Nu ma Nu ma!”

0:26:16.380,0:26:17.380
[Trog laughs]

0:26:17.380,0:26:21.480
Wayne: And it’s just like everything I’m
playing sounds like shit, and the sad part—The

0:26:21.480,0:26:24.200
campaign is long and you have to play it to
unlock everything.

0:26:24.200,0:26:25.200
Gir: Yeah, it’s frustrating.

0:26:25.200,0:26:29.590
Wayne: And I like—It, for me, for some people
who really like the game like Scorpy, and

0:26:29.590,0:26:33.450
like you, Baaulp, you guys have been motivated
to play it enough to unlock most of the shit,

0:26:33.450,0:26:34.450
I’m like done.

0:26:34.450,0:26:37.409
I don’t think I’m gonna play Fuser anymore
because the campaign is that annoying for

0:26:37.409,0:26:38.409
me.

0:26:38.409,0:26:39.409
Baaulp: Wow.

0:26:39.409,0:26:40.409
Gir: It’s-it’s a slog.

0:26:40.409,0:26:41.409
Baaulp: You’re not gonna just tough it out?

0:26:41.409,0:26:44.250
Wayne: It’s a fucking slog, and frankly,
I don’t get enough out of the game to like,

0:26:44.250,0:26:48.350
keep going, like maybe I’ll keep doing it,
but I don’t know.

0:26:48.350,0:26:52.549
Trog: I mean, do you think eventually somebody
will just create like, “Hey, run this cheat

0:26:52.549,0:26:54.950
table, or download this save file, or—”

0:26:54.950,0:26:55.950
Wayne: I hope.

0:26:55.950,0:26:59.310
That’s what I hope, but like, the-the game
is very online integrated—

0:26:59.310,0:27:00.310
Trog: Yeah.

0:27:00.310,0:27:04.380
Wayne: And I think they might like, god, imagine
getting banned for hacking in a fucking DJ

0:27:04.380,0:27:05.380
game.

0:27:05.380,0:27:06.380
[Trog laughs]

0:27:06.380,0:27:11.340
Log: Well it just depends, if there’s local
files for like the-the purchasable songs and

0:27:11.340,0:27:15.000
clearing the campaign and stuff like, I can
imagine there’s something like that.

0:27:15.000,0:27:18.230
Wayne: Something like that might happen, but
then it’ll-I bet it’ll block you from

0:27:18.230,0:27:20.649
playing online multiplayer, which is the best
part.

0:27:20.649,0:27:22.880
Baaulp: No, I don’t think they’d—Hopefully
they wouldn’t do that.

0:27:22.880,0:27:27.429
Well, here’s the thing, the campaign is
longer than it seems, but what I did was I

0:27:27.429,0:27:32.360
just sat down one night, and I was just like,
“Yeah, this campaign sucks, I’m just gonna

0:27:32.360,0:27:33.360
go through it.”

0:27:33.360,0:27:34.360
Wayne: Can you-can you fail?

0:27:34.360,0:27:35.360
Baaulp: It’s very hard to fail.

0:27:35.360,0:27:38.990
Wayne: Someone just make a fuckin’ bot that
plays the whole campaign for you.

0:27:38.990,0:27:40.140
Trog: Yeah, just a macro.

0:27:40.140,0:27:41.289
Wayne: Just like fuckin’, yeah.

0:27:41.289,0:27:45.440
Baaulp: What I did, and I assume Scorpy did
the same thing, is I just sat down one night

0:27:45.440,0:27:48.520
and I was like, “Yeah, this campaign a slog,
I’m just gonna go through it ‘cause I

0:27:48.520,0:27:49.520
like this game enough.”

0:27:49.520,0:27:52.100
And that’s the game’s major blemish.

0:27:52.100,0:27:57.450
It’s-it’s—It has two blemishes, but
one is like, it’s about the price.

0:27:57.450,0:27:58.669
So, the first blemish is—

0:27:58.669,0:27:59.750
Gir: There’s three blemishes, then.

0:27:59.750,0:28:00.750
Baaulp: Really.

0:28:00.750,0:28:01.750
Gir: Mhmm.

0:28:01.750,0:28:03.899
Baaulp: The first blemish is that the campaign,
it’s a slog, you need to go through it to

0:28:03.899,0:28:08.360
unlock everything, but what I did was I just
sat down, I was like, I just went through

0:28:08.360,0:28:09.360
it.

0:28:09.360,0:28:12.760
And it took me—Really, it only took me one
night, ‘cause you-like, I didn’t-you don’t

0:28:12.760,0:28:19.320
get much aside from XP which you use to unlock
more songs from—And you can get XP other

0:28:19.320,0:28:23.940
ways, like, so I was like, I’m just gonna
get three starts on every part, fuck it.

0:28:23.940,0:28:25.480
And I’m done.

0:28:25.480,0:28:27.530
I finished; I’m done.

0:28:27.530,0:28:32.050
Wayne: The campaign also has, like, there’s
cutscenes, they’re so bad.

0:28:32.050,0:28:33.050
Baaulp: Yeahhh.

0:28:33.050,0:28:36.920
Wayne: They’re just like, they created these
fake DJ personas that are the most obnoxious,

0:28:36.920,0:28:43.659
like, annoying characters with awful writing,
and then like, then the cherry on top is they

0:28:43.659,0:28:45.010
all look scary.

0:28:45.010,0:28:50.250
Their art-the art style for like the faces
in that game is this weird mix of like, Overwatch

0:28:50.250,0:28:53.750
and like, DreamWorks characters, and it’s
like, unsettling.

0:28:53.750,0:28:54.750
Baaulp: Uncanny valley.

0:28:54.750,0:28:57.169
Wayne: It is nearly uncanny valley—Yeah.

0:28:57.169,0:29:01.410
The best-looking character is the kid who
wore a mask the entire time ‘cause I couldn’t

0:29:01.410,0:29:02.410
see his face.

0:29:02.410,0:29:03.410
Baaulp: Yeah, I agree.

0:29:03.410,0:29:08.830
It’s kind of weird because it’s like,
they’re realistic, but just not realistic

0:29:08.830,0:29:11.450
enough where it’s like, “This is like
a marionette thing.”

0:29:11.450,0:29:13.769
Gir: It doesn’t help that they all have
mocap.

0:29:13.769,0:29:14.769
[Wayne laughs]

0:29:14.769,0:29:19.880
Baaulp: Yeah, like I wish-I wish they were
less detailed, ‘cause then that would look

0:29:19.880,0:29:21.230
fine, y’know.

0:29:21.230,0:29:22.730
The other thing is the price tag.

0:29:22.730,0:29:28.880
It’s sixty bucks, which is fine for like
a new big budget game, but when you add the

0:29:28.880,0:29:33.260
fact that you’re probably gonna get DLC,
like it adds up.

0:29:33.260,0:29:36.910
Some people might not be into that, that’s
why it’s like, that may or may not be a

0:29:36.910,0:29:37.910
concern for you.

0:29:37.910,0:29:38.910
What was the third thing you said?

0:29:38.910,0:29:39.910
You said—

0:29:39.910,0:29:46.029
Gir: The third thing for me is the multiplayer
is just incorrect.

0:29:46.029,0:29:47.029
Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

0:29:47.029,0:29:48.340
Gir: They set it up incorrectly.

0:29:48.340,0:29:50.580
Wayne: It needs to be more configurable.

0:29:50.580,0:29:57.929
Gir: It is called co-op freestyle, but there
can be an individual winner.

0:29:57.929,0:30:01.679
That-that co-op—There is neither co-op nor
freestyle in that.

0:30:01.679,0:30:06.430
Wayne: I mean, it’s not really a winner,
it’s just like-it’s just like, “Oh,

0:30:06.430,0:30:08.970
you got the most likes from your friends,”
It doesn’t—

0:30:08.970,0:30:13.990
Gir: No, but it’s a-it makes it feel pointless,
‘cause you sit there, you have like thirty

0:30:13.990,0:30:19.049
seconds to do anything, and then your turn’s
over and you have to go through a cycle.

0:30:19.049,0:30:20.190
Wayne: You need more time.

0:30:20.190,0:30:25.570
Like the—It’s co-op in the sense that
like, wherever your friend leaves off, that’s

0:30:25.570,0:30:29.420
where you pick up, and like, you have to take
that set and turn it into something, that’s

0:30:29.420,0:30:30.420
why it’s co-op.

0:30:30.420,0:30:31.420
Gir: That also feels competitive.

0:30:31.420,0:30:32.420
‘Cause you can just—

0:30:32.420,0:30:34.820
Wayne: It becomes slightly more competitive,
especially when it’s in a streamed environment,

0:30:34.820,0:30:38.520
because then everyone in your chat is like,
“Oh, you fuckin’ lost, you got no likes!

0:30:38.520,0:30:39.520
Blah!

0:30:39.520,0:30:40.520
Wah!”

0:30:40.520,0:30:43.309
And like, then it becomes a little bit different,
but like it’s not really a winner.

0:30:43.309,0:30:50.130
Baaulp: Yeah, what I was gonna say is like,
yeah, it like—That mode is fine the way

0:30:50.130,0:30:53.929
it is, it’s just like so fast.

0:30:53.929,0:30:57.860
Each person needs like, minimum six minutes.

0:30:57.860,0:30:59.380
Gir: Six minutes?!

0:30:59.380,0:31:00.519
That’s a little too much.

0:31:00.519,0:31:01.519
Baaulp: Yes, yes!

0:31:01.519,0:31:02.519
‘Cause it’s freestyle!

0:31:02.519,0:31:03.519
You’re supposed to just jam out!

0:31:03.519,0:31:05.570
Wayne: I could see a mode where I’d want
six minutes.

0:31:05.570,0:31:06.570
Like, it should be configurable.

0:31:06.570,0:31:07.570
Like, let me—

0:31:07.570,0:31:08.570
Gir: Configurable, yes.

0:31:08.570,0:31:09.570
Sure.

0:31:09.570,0:31:12.410
Wayne: Two minutes-two minutes would be good,
but you get like, forty-five seconds.

0:31:12.410,0:31:13.410
It’s like—

0:31:13.410,0:31:14.410
Gir: Thirty.

0:31:14.410,0:31:15.410
Wayne: Is it literally thirty seconds?

0:31:15.410,0:31:16.410
There’s no way.

0:31:16.410,0:31:17.960
Gir: No, it changes based on BPM.

0:31:17.960,0:31:18.960
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:31:18.960,0:31:21.289
Gir: But it’s like, thirty to sixty seconds.

0:31:21.289,0:31:23.680
Log: Yeah, that’s even worse, you have to
pick a-you have to go slow.

0:31:23.680,0:31:26.240
You have to go slow to get any time.

0:31:26.240,0:31:30.110
And then sometimes-sometimes it bugs out and
you’re not allowed to like mess with any

0:31:30.110,0:31:32.700
of your discs for the first ten seconds.

0:31:32.700,0:31:35.330
Baaulp: Well, I assume that’s a bug that
they’ll fix.

0:31:35.330,0:31:39.191
Wayne: The nature of the co-op freestyle mode
becoming slightly more competitive—The fun

0:31:39.191,0:31:44.970
part is just fucking over your friends by
like, “Alright, Gir’s up next, BPM 3,000.

0:31:44.970,0:31:48.399
Alright, uh, six Soulja Boy tracks, and All
Star.

0:31:48.399,0:31:49.399
Alright.

0:31:49.399,0:31:50.399
There you go.”

0:31:50.399,0:31:51.399
And like—

0:31:51.399,0:31:52.399
Log: Swap in the-the Happy lyrics.

0:31:52.399,0:31:53.580
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:31:53.580,0:31:55.750
Log: [Singing] “Might seem crazy what I’m
‘bout to say.”

0:31:55.750,0:31:56.909
Wayne: [Singing] “Might seem crazy what
I’m ‘bout to say.”

0:31:56.909,0:32:01.320
Log: It always ends on like a specific bit,
whenever you’re done with your part, it

0:32:01.320,0:32:05.520
always ends with like a specific bit it trails
off and then goes to the next guy.

0:32:05.520,0:32:08.671
If you end it with Happy, it’ll always just
be Pharrell Williams going, “Might seem

0:32:08.671,0:32:10.700
crazy what I’m ‘bout to say.”

0:32:10.700,0:32:11.700
[Baaulp laughs]

0:32:11.700,0:32:16.049
Wayne: Being bad at that game is also just
funny, because like-I’ll just like stumble

0:32:16.049,0:32:19.840
over the controls or not pick the right track
and then all of a sudden you just have like,

0:32:19.840,0:32:24.450
one vocal track so low and nothing else just—“Don’t
let the walls cave in on you!”

0:32:24.450,0:32:27.529
And just like, ten seconds of silence ‘cause
that vocal track is just like, fucked.

0:32:27.529,0:32:30.320
Gir: ‘Cause you can’t remember which ones
are playing at what time.

0:32:30.320,0:32:31.320
[Wayne laughs]

0:32:31.320,0:32:35.020
Trog: Well, despite what all of you have said
about the bad parts of this game, I am still

0:32:35.020,0:32:36.900
very interested in playing it.

0:32:36.900,0:32:38.460
Wayne: At its core it’s great!

0:32:38.460,0:32:42.419
Baaulp: If you are like, the reason why I
point all those out is because if you are

0:32:42.419,0:32:48.340
willing to pay for the game, if you’re willing
to deal with a monetization model like a DLC

0:32:48.340,0:32:53.029
model that is exactly the same as the other
Harmonix games like Rock Band, and just know

0:32:53.029,0:32:59.529
that like mechanics are locked behind a campaign,
this game is like, legitimately the most fun

0:32:59.529,0:33:03.480
I’ve had in a-with a—With a single-player
video game in a long time.

0:33:03.480,0:33:07.779
Like, there have been days where I like, where
I’ll be like, “Oh, I’ll play some Fuser!”

0:33:07.779,0:33:12.190
And then I’ll play, and then I’ll look
at the clock and it’s like, “Oh, it’s

0:33:12.190,0:33:13.190
like, 4AM now.”

0:33:13.190,0:33:14.190
[Laughs]

0:33:14.190,0:33:15.190
Trog: Yeah.

0:33:15.190,0:33:17.890
It seems like that kind of game where—‘Cause
you can just put it on a mode where you just

0:33:17.890,0:33:18.890
like keep going, right?

0:33:18.890,0:33:19.890
Like it’s just infinite—

0:33:19.890,0:33:20.890
Baaulp: Yes.

0:33:20.890,0:33:21.890
The freestyle mode is fun.

0:33:21.890,0:33:26.419
Wayne: Yeah, the freestyle mode-that—I wish—If
the freestyle mode just had everything unlocked,

0:33:26.419,0:33:27.769
like effect-wise, it would be fine.

0:33:27.769,0:33:28.769
Gir: Yeah, Every.

0:33:28.769,0:33:29.769
Single.

0:33:29.769,0:33:30.769
Thing.

0:33:30.769,0:33:31.769
Wayne: It’d be perfect.

0:33:31.769,0:33:32.769
The game would be great.

0:33:32.769,0:33:35.549
Gir: My personal recommendation for Fuser
is give it like a month or two, let them release

0:33:35.549,0:33:40.810
more songs, see if they’ll mix up the freestyle
or the co-op freestyle, see if they add anything

0:33:40.810,0:33:42.900
to it, and then get it.

0:33:42.900,0:33:47.620
Trog: Yeah, I mean the good thing is, similar
to all video games that are released nowadays

0:33:47.620,0:33:49.149
is that it can get patched, y’know?

0:33:49.149,0:33:52.960
Like they can-they can change things, they
can add things, so.

0:33:52.960,0:33:56.539
Wayne: I am very curious to see what modders
do to it—

0:33:56.539,0:33:57.539
Trog: Yeah, custom songs.

0:33:57.539,0:34:00.919
Wayne: —because it is apparently made in
a format where that’s possible, and I’m

0:34:00.919,0:34:05.900
curious if people figure out how to put stems
into it proper, that like actually sound correct.

0:34:05.900,0:34:11.700
Trog: Being able to add custom music and specifically
have it work in multiplayer would be the funniest

0:34:11.700,0:34:12.700
shit ever.

0:34:12.700,0:34:13.700
Wayne: Oh, it’d be great.

0:34:13.700,0:34:14.700
Trog: That would be a no brainer.

0:34:14.700,0:34:20.480
Gir: I’d like to see people just make-just
make different assorted tracks of like, videos.

0:34:20.480,0:34:25.040
It’s like, it’s like, uh, all the CDI
cutscenes as tracks.

0:34:25.040,0:34:27.220
Trog: Yeah, like that would be great, are
you kidding me.

0:34:27.220,0:34:28.220
That’d be so good.

0:34:28.220,0:34:29.220
Gir: I would love that.

0:34:29.220,0:34:32.570
Baaulp: I keep saying this, but, it’s kind
of accurate.

0:34:32.570,0:34:35.950
It’s like, it’s not the best video game—

0:34:35.950,0:34:36.950
Gir: But it’s a good one.

0:34:36.950,0:34:38.359
Baaulp: —but it is an amazing toy.

0:34:38.359,0:34:44.329
Like, it is the best thing to just sit down
on and be like, “I’m gonna fuckin’,

0:34:44.329,0:34:48.080
just, this is the funnest I’ve had in a
long time, just messing with tracks.”

0:34:48.080,0:34:50.210
Wayne: This is the funnest I’ve had!

0:34:50.210,0:34:51.320
Baaulp: Yeah [laughs].

0:34:51.320,0:34:52.619
Log: This is too funnest!

0:34:52.619,0:34:53.619
[Wayne laughs]

0:34:53.619,0:34:54.619
Baaulp: This is too funnest!

0:34:54.619,0:34:57.349
I’m gonna eat up—Oh, let’s play peppers!

0:34:57.349,0:34:58.349
[Everyone laughs]

0:34:58.349,0:35:04.050
Trog: I was asking Scorpy about this yesterday,
I was asking if they had MIDI support, because

0:35:04.050,0:35:08.420
like, the way that the game is setup sort
of looks like they were kind of emulating

0:35:08.420,0:35:15.570
like, the idea of a MIDI controller with certain
parts of the UI, but there’s no like, there’s

0:35:15.570,0:35:19.090
no support for an actual MIDI controller.

0:35:19.090,0:35:24.130
I would love if the game supported a MIDI
controller at some point.

0:35:24.130,0:35:30.650
‘Cause that would add like another layer
of fun if you could use an actual DJ turntable

0:35:30.650,0:35:31.740
like with a MIDI output.

0:35:31.740,0:35:37.320
Gir: I’d like to see them actually make,
or have somebody make for them, a uh, peripheral.

0:35:37.320,0:35:39.580
Trog: A peripheral, yeah.

0:35:39.580,0:35:43.140
I think they’re probably done with the whole
peripheral game.

0:35:43.140,0:35:45.320
It-it didn’t work out for them in the end.

0:35:45.320,0:35:46.400
Gir: Them personally, sure.

0:35:46.400,0:35:50.361
But I could-I would-I could definitely see
a third party wanting to do it for them.

0:35:50.361,0:35:54.490
Baaulp: The one thing I want, and they don’t
even have to add this, but it’d be insane

0:35:54.490,0:35:59.850
if they add this—It doesn’t even go as
far as what Trog wants, just let me get my

0:35:59.850,0:36:03.410
André 3000 on, I want to be able to play
tracks in reverse.

0:36:03.410,0:36:05.160
Trog: That would be interesting.

0:36:05.160,0:36:06.380
That’d be cool.

0:36:06.380,0:36:09.220
I could see them adding more effects and stuff,
yeah.

0:36:09.220,0:36:10.220
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:36:10.220,0:36:14.251
Trog: Like, they have a good core of a game,
they just need to flesh it out, it sounds

0:36:14.251,0:36:15.251
like.

0:36:15.251,0:36:16.251
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:36:16.251,0:36:20.119
Wayne: The one thing that might make me go
slog through the campaign again is the fucking,

0:36:20.119,0:36:24.410
like, some of those effects seem like so much
fun, like the looping, and the distortion.

0:36:24.410,0:36:25.800
Baaulp: What I’ll say is—

0:36:25.800,0:36:26.800
Wayne: The stutter.

0:36:26.800,0:36:28.970
Baaulp: Skip every cutscene, they tell you
what you need to—

0:36:28.970,0:36:29.970
Wayne: Yeah, I already do.

0:36:29.970,0:36:30.970
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:36:30.970,0:36:31.970
Wayne: Don’t worry.

0:36:31.970,0:36:32.970
Baaulp: Skip—Yeah, skip every cutscene,
and just like—

0:36:32.970,0:36:35.710
Wayne: I kind of—I think I’m gonna try—Like
I honestly might just go in and try to play

0:36:35.710,0:36:39.790
it, like, blindly, like just pressing keys
and not even paying attention.

0:36:39.790,0:36:43.460
Baaulp: Nah, don’t do that, ‘cause the
key to getting at least three stars—

0:36:43.460,0:36:44.550
Wayne: It’s just so…

0:36:44.550,0:36:45.780
It sounds so bad!

0:36:45.780,0:36:47.130
It just makes me mad!

0:36:47.130,0:36:50.500
Like when they force me to drop in random
tracks and fuckin’ mute shit—

0:36:50.500,0:36:52.440
Baaulp: I know, I know, I know.

0:36:52.440,0:36:53.440
Yeah, it’s weird.

0:36:53.440,0:36:58.099
And like, I don’t even fully blame them
for that, because it’s like, how do you

0:36:58.099,0:36:59.980
gamify being a DJ?

0:36:59.980,0:37:01.190
Like, you’re not—You’re expressing,
not playing it.

0:37:01.190,0:37:03.090
Gir: How do you gamify subjective taste?

0:37:03.090,0:37:04.090
Trog: DJ Hero.

0:37:04.090,0:37:05.990
Baaulp: Yeah, you’re expressing, not playing
an instrument.

0:37:05.990,0:37:07.320
Y’know, so it’s like.

0:37:07.320,0:37:08.320
Gir: Yeah.

0:37:08.320,0:37:09.420
Trog: I mean, they tried it.

0:37:09.420,0:37:14.980
They tried it with DJ Hero, and it was just
kind of like, y’know, it was just a normal,

0:37:14.980,0:37:18.920
notes coming at you, press them to make them
disappear rhythm game, but…

0:37:18.920,0:37:24.400
Wayne: One of the weirder features of the
game is like, they have like instruments where

0:37:24.400,0:37:29.560
you can just like play loops of like, drum
pad instruments and they kind of suck.

0:37:29.560,0:37:30.560
Gir: They do, they sound like shit.

0:37:30.560,0:37:33.490
Wayne: Like they kind of just don’t really
fit, ever.

0:37:33.490,0:37:38.321
You have like—One of the earliest instances
in the campaign where I just got like, mad

0:37:38.321,0:37:42.600
at what the game was asking me to do was I
was doing a rap set, and like, it was all

0:37:42.600,0:37:47.510
like classic rap, so I’m playin’ like
DMX, I’m playin’ like Nelly, and then

0:37:47.510,0:37:48.510
it’s like, “Alright!

0:37:48.510,0:37:50.150
Now drop in a fancy piano loop!”

0:37:50.150,0:37:53.410
And the fancy piano it’s like, just like
classical piano.

0:37:53.410,0:37:54.960
Gir: It’s like a MIDI piano.

0:37:54.960,0:37:59.520
Wayne: And it sounds—It’s a classical
MIDI piano, and like, you got X—you got,

0:37:59.520,0:38:03.040
“X GONNA GIVE IT TO YA, HE GON’—”
[Wayne imitates a soft piano tune], and it’s

0:38:03.040,0:38:04.220
just like, what is this?

0:38:04.220,0:38:07.890
Gir: And then you have an elf in the background
playing his piano, and it sounds like shit.

0:38:07.890,0:38:11.670
Wayne: What is—I don’t know, like why
did it—and that was the mission where it

0:38:11.670,0:38:15.650
introduced that to me, and it’s like, why
do you want me to do a rap set and then you

0:38:15.650,0:38:18.069
give me this shit, this trash?

0:38:18.069,0:38:19.780
Gir: Yeah, I don’t know.

0:38:19.780,0:38:20.780
Wayne: It’s inexplicable.

0:38:20.780,0:38:22.950
Gir: I would love for them to just not lock
that behind the campaign.

0:38:22.950,0:38:28.140
I’d like for them to patch that out, I don’t
know—I understand that they wanted to use

0:38:28.140,0:38:32.910
it as a tutorial, uh, I think I would rather
learn by just playing with the tools than

0:38:32.910,0:38:34.990
being forced to use them.

0:38:34.990,0:38:36.500
It’s more fun.

0:38:36.500,0:38:38.900
Wayne: What else we’ve been playing?

0:38:38.900,0:38:39.940
Gir: Oh?

0:38:39.940,0:38:42.550
What else we’ve been playing?

0:38:42.550,0:38:44.230
The answer to that is… uh…

0:38:44.230,0:38:46.569
Wayne: Welcome to WayneRadioTV’s Dead by
Daylight killer tutorial.

0:38:46.569,0:38:47.700
Gir: I have-I…

0:38:47.700,0:38:51.140
I—I’m struggling to think of what else
I’ve played.

0:38:51.140,0:38:53.440
Wayne: Lesson one, Barbecue and Chili.

0:38:53.440,0:38:54.589
Lesson two, Pudding.

0:38:54.589,0:38:55.589
Lesson three…

0:38:55.589,0:38:57.270
Log: Guilty Gear and Tekken.

0:38:57.270,0:38:58.270
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:38:58.270,0:38:59.270
Gir: Oh!

0:38:59.270,0:39:00.270
Teardown!

0:39:00.270,0:39:01.700
Wayne: Dead by Daylight is like all I’ve
been playing.

0:39:01.700,0:39:05.000
Gir: Teardown came down-came out and I had
fun with that for the first week.

0:39:05.000,0:39:09.100
Baaulp: Aside from Fuser, we’re all playing
very different things, actually.

0:39:09.100,0:39:14.200
This is the one week where, aside from Fuser,
a lot of us are just playing something different.

0:39:14.200,0:39:18.349
I’ve been playing Tekken, uh, I’ve been
playing a mishmash of things.

0:39:18.349,0:39:23.520
Gir: Instead of playing games, for the last
couple days I have restarted watching Star

0:39:23.520,0:39:24.520
Trek: Voyager.

0:39:24.520,0:39:25.520
Baaulp: Oh, shit.

0:39:25.520,0:39:26.520
Gir: And uh—

0:39:26.520,0:39:27.520
Baaulp: How’s that?

0:39:27.520,0:39:28.520
How’s the Neelix show?

0:39:28.520,0:39:32.010
Gir: Uh, there’s not one likable person
in that entire ship.

0:39:32.010,0:39:33.010
Trog: Bad.

0:39:33.010,0:39:34.010
Not even Neelix?

0:39:34.010,0:39:35.640
Gir: Everybody in that fucking ship sucks.

0:39:35.640,0:39:38.280
Wayne: Wait, is Voyager the one with Neelix?

0:39:38.280,0:39:39.280
Gir and Baaulp: Yes.

0:39:39.280,0:39:40.280
Trog: Yeah.

0:39:40.280,0:39:41.280
Wayne: I thought that was Deep Space Nine,
I don’t know shit.

0:39:41.280,0:39:45.650
Gir: I’ve tried watching Voyager before,
and I-I got start to finish, but that was

0:39:45.650,0:39:49.020
like—I watched maybe four or five episodes
out of each season.

0:39:49.020,0:39:54.450
I’m trying to watch more this time around,
I’m almost on season four now, nobody—There’s

0:39:54.450,0:39:57.040
not a good person on the ship at all, for
real.

0:39:57.040,0:39:58.040
Baaulp: What?

0:39:58.040,0:39:59.040
You don’t like uh, Neelix?

0:39:59.040,0:40:00.040
Gir: No.

0:40:00.040,0:40:01.280
Baaulp: You don’t like Captain-Captain uh—

0:40:01.280,0:40:03.270
Trog: What about Tuvok?

0:40:03.270,0:40:07.720
Gir: Nobody likes Neelix, in fact, they go
out of their way to make fun of how awful

0:40:07.720,0:40:11.560
Neelix is at cooking, and yet he’s always
the cook.

0:40:11.560,0:40:17.650
Uh, the Captain is like, I don’t know, she’s
like, bipolar where one moment she’s against

0:40:17.650,0:40:21.480
something and immediately five seconds later
she’s all for it, uh—

0:40:21.480,0:40:23.069
Trog: I think Tuvok.

0:40:23.069,0:40:24.069
What about Tuvok?

0:40:24.069,0:40:25.069
What about, uh—

0:40:25.069,0:40:26.069
Baaulp: Yeah, what about Tuvok?

0:40:26.069,0:40:29.599
Gir: Tuvok is a Vulcan, and he’s a wet blanket
even for a Vulcan.

0:40:29.599,0:40:31.190
Trog: Sounds like the show sucks.

0:40:31.190,0:40:32.630
Gir: And yet it’s keeping my attention.

0:40:32.630,0:40:34.540
Log: Why don’t you just quit?

0:40:34.540,0:40:38.360
Baaulp: Why don’t you just watch TNG again?

0:40:38.360,0:40:39.360
Wayne: It’s true.

0:40:39.360,0:40:41.240
Gir: [Laughs] I can’t-I can’t, I’ve
done it like three times, I can’t.

0:40:41.240,0:40:44.800
Log: Why don’t you type any given word on
Netflix and watch it?

0:40:44.800,0:40:45.800
You could type in pepper.

0:40:45.800,0:40:47.060
Wayne: Netflix sucks.

0:40:47.060,0:40:48.200
Baaulp: What’s better?

0:40:48.200,0:40:49.849
Surviving R. Kelly or Voyager?

0:40:49.849,0:40:50.910
Gir: Voyager.

0:40:50.910,0:40:55.210
Wayne: Other than shows I’ve already seen,
there’s genuinely nothing on Netflix that

0:40:55.210,0:40:57.520
like, I’ve wanted to watch at the moment.

0:40:57.520,0:40:58.520
The uh—

0:40:58.520,0:41:02.780
Gir: Something that just came across my eyes
today on Netflix was something called uh,

0:41:02.780,0:41:06.880
what was it, it was like, “Son of Odin,”
or some shit?

0:41:06.880,0:41:07.880
What the fuck was it?

0:41:07.880,0:41:09.530
Trog: I don’t know, you tell me.

0:41:09.530,0:41:12.010
Gir: Okay, I will tell you, Trog.

0:41:12.010,0:41:14.730
It was called, “Son of—Blood of Zeus.”

0:41:14.730,0:41:15.730
Trog: Wow.

0:41:15.730,0:41:16.730
What’s it about.

0:41:16.730,0:41:18.350
Gir: And I—I don’t know.

0:41:18.350,0:41:20.970
Wayne: Why’d you even bring it up.

0:41:20.970,0:41:22.680
Gir: It just looks interesting.

0:41:22.680,0:41:23.680
Log: It’s about-it’s about Hades.

0:41:23.680,0:41:26.270
Gir: I was hoping somebody had actually played
it.

0:41:26.270,0:41:28.640
Or watched it, rather [laughs].

0:41:28.640,0:41:32.880
Wayne: You heard of—"Alright guys, I was
on Netflix today, I saw show called Haunting

0:41:32.880,0:41:33.880
of Bly Manor.

0:41:33.880,0:41:35.400
I don’t know anything else.

0:41:35.400,0:41:36.400
Conversation over.

0:41:36.400,0:41:37.400
Um… [laughs].”

0:41:37.400,0:41:38.400
Gir: I was hoping someone had seen it!

0:41:38.400,0:41:43.079
Log: I typed in Pepper and it gave me results
that were not related to pepper.

0:41:43.079,0:41:47.211
Wayne: I went on Netflix and I shaw [laughs]—I
saw a show called Peppers and I watched it.

0:41:47.211,0:41:49.849
Baaulp: And it was just a video of people
eating peppers.

0:41:49.849,0:41:52.170
Wayne: And then I got a big urge to play Peppers.

0:41:52.170,0:41:54.810
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:41:54.810,0:42:00.430
Log: The first result is called Peppermint,
but it’s not out yet, but the rest of the

0:42:00.430,0:42:03.630
results are like Maria, PJ Masks, um—

0:42:03.630,0:42:04.830
Trog: Hmm.

0:42:04.830,0:42:08.319
Log: It’s like a fusion of kid’s shows
and also like,uh—

0:42:08.319,0:42:10.160
Gir: People with guns.

0:42:10.160,0:42:13.800
Log: Military action shows starring Matt Damon
and Ryan Reynolds [laughs].

0:42:13.800,0:42:15.800
Wayne: Have you guys ever watched a Hallmark
movie?

0:42:15.800,0:42:16.800
Baaulp: Yes.

0:42:16.800,0:42:19.150
Wayne: Their existence perplexes me.

0:42:19.150,0:42:20.150
Their—It-it-it is—

0:42:20.150,0:42:23.720
Gir: Well, you’re not a fifty-seven year
old woman!

0:42:23.720,0:42:24.890
Wayne: I know!

0:42:24.890,0:42:29.460
I’ve watched one because like, a while—a
long time ago I dated a girl who thought they

0:42:29.460,0:42:33.550
were like kind of entertaining and kind of
funny, and I watched one and it was just the

0:42:33.550,0:42:34.730
most like, drivel—

0:42:34.730,0:42:35.730
Baaulp: Milquetoast.

0:42:35.730,0:42:37.140
Wayne: —just like, milquetoast thing.

0:42:37.140,0:42:40.440
It was a Christmas movie about a knight who—

0:42:40.440,0:42:41.440
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Wait, wait!

0:42:41.440,0:42:42.440
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

0:42:42.440,0:42:43.440
Wayne: —went forward in time and falls in
love with a white girl.

0:42:43.440,0:42:44.440
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Dammit.

0:42:44.440,0:42:45.440
Wayne: What?

0:42:45.440,0:42:46.440
Baaulp: Dammit.

0:42:46.440,0:42:47.440
I was-I was gonna guess the—I wanted to
guess.

0:42:47.440,0:42:48.440
I wanted to guess.

0:42:48.440,0:42:50.359
Gir: I wouldn’t have guessed a knight travelling
through time, to be fair.

0:42:50.359,0:42:51.900
Trog: No, that-that sounds interesting.

0:42:51.900,0:42:56.069
Wayne: I mean, the concept there was a little
bit wild, but it was just boring as fuck—

0:42:56.069,0:42:57.069
Trog: Yeah.

0:42:57.069,0:42:59.620
Wayne: And it was just like—And the knight
was like—They didn’t even do anything

0:42:59.620,0:43:03.009
interesting with it, it was just like, the
knight would be on a horse and like, he’d

0:43:03.009,0:43:06.420
see a car and be like, “That’s a strange
horse.”

0:43:06.420,0:43:09.020
And he was way too calm, and it just sucked.

0:43:09.020,0:43:10.020
Trog: [Using a deep voice changer] “What
a strange beast.”

0:43:10.020,0:43:12.800
Gir: Did the lady say that he was her knight
in shining armor?

0:43:12.800,0:43:14.470
Wayne: Probably, I don’t remember.

0:43:14.470,0:43:15.470
[Gir laughs]

0:43:15.470,0:43:20.060
Wayne: There was some weird subplot about
the knight being cursed by like a witch, and

0:43:20.060,0:43:24.849
like the witch was also travelling through
time, and it-and then like-I don’t know…

0:43:24.849,0:43:27.770
Gir: Hallmark had to water it down for being
too exciting.

0:43:27.770,0:43:34.660
Wayne: The other Hallmark movie we watched
was like, it was-it was literally about ChristianMingle.com

0:43:34.660,0:43:35.849
like, the website.

0:43:35.849,0:43:36.849
Baaulp: What?

0:43:36.849,0:43:37.849
[Gir laughs]

0:43:37.849,0:43:38.849
Trog: Like sponsored?

0:43:38.849,0:43:44.000
Wayne: And it was like, it was about-it was
about a woman who wasn’t Christian like,

0:43:44.000,0:43:48.020
thinking that all the men on regular dating
sites were bad and not good, so she went on

0:43:48.020,0:43:53.680
ChristianMingle.com and started dating Christian
men and pretending to be Christian, and then

0:43:53.680,0:43:59.380
she goes to like-then she goes on like a…
like a—What do you call it when you go to

0:43:59.380,0:44:00.960
another country, you like, build houses?

0:44:00.960,0:44:01.960
Like a mission—

0:44:01.960,0:44:02.960
Trog: Yeah.

0:44:02.960,0:44:03.960
Wayne: Like a mission trip or whatever they
call it.

0:44:03.960,0:44:09.020
She goes on like a mission trip to Mexico
and it got a little weird and like and then

0:44:09.020,0:44:12.559
they’re like-and then they figure out she’s
not Christian and they’re like, “You lied

0:44:12.559,0:44:13.700
about your faith.

0:44:13.700,0:44:17.240
I’m sorry but God says I can’t date you
anymore,” and then they break up.

0:44:17.240,0:44:18.240
Baaulp: Ha.

0:44:18.240,0:44:20.359
Wayne: But then she-but then she really starts
reading the Bible and she’s like, “Wow,

0:44:20.359,0:44:25.131
this God stuff’s pretty great,” and then-and
then they fall in love and go to church together.

0:44:25.131,0:44:27.380
The reason I bring this up—

0:44:27.380,0:44:29.050
Gir: Oh, that movie has a bad ending.

0:44:29.050,0:44:30.050
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:44:30.050,0:44:34.012
Wayne: I think—I saw this I think like-I
don’t remember where I saw it, but like

0:44:34.012,0:44:39.040
I saw this sweepstakes really recently where
the number one reward is that you get to star

0:44:39.040,0:44:43.970
in a Hallmark movie, and that is like the
craziest-that is like the craziest fucking

0:44:43.970,0:44:44.970
sweepstakes—

0:44:44.970,0:44:45.970
Trog: Oh god.

0:44:45.970,0:44:46.970
Baaulp: What?

0:44:46.970,0:44:47.970
What?

0:44:47.970,0:44:48.970
Gir: The lamest.

0:44:48.970,0:44:51.809
Wayne: No, ‘cause to me, like, what would
happen if you won and you like, sucked.

0:44:51.809,0:44:52.990
Trog: Were bad.

0:44:52.990,0:44:54.703
They could do a lot in editing.

0:44:54.703,0:44:55.703
[Wayne laughs]

0:44:55.703,0:44:58.060
Baaulp: Okay, okay, if you had to wager-if
I had to wager a guess, there’s no way in

0:44:58.060,0:45:02.359
hell they let you play the white couple that
actually falls in love.

0:45:02.359,0:45:05.849
When they say star, you’re probably like
a secondary-like a supporting character.

0:45:05.849,0:45:07.300
Wayne: God, that’d be so funny.

0:45:07.300,0:45:09.079
I like-I almost wish I could win.

0:45:09.079,0:45:10.710
Like, that would be fucking hilarious.

0:45:10.710,0:45:14.660
Like, I’m just streaming and it’s like,
“Hey guys, I’m in this Hallmark movie,

0:45:14.660,0:45:17.770
go check out the Christian Mingle official
movie!

0:45:17.770,0:45:19.100
Go watch that shit.”

0:45:19.100,0:45:24.410
Baaulp: I’m the guy in the background eating
corndogs while the white couple falls in love.

0:45:24.410,0:45:25.410
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

0:45:25.410,0:45:26.650
Wayne: It would be sick.

0:45:26.650,0:45:28.890
I would love to be in an awful movie.

0:45:28.890,0:45:29.890
Just a trash, like—

0:45:29.890,0:45:31.150
Trog: It would be fun.

0:45:31.150,0:45:35.280
Gir: That’s something, is I’ve always
kept my eye out for Neil Breen doing casting

0:45:35.280,0:45:36.280
calls here in Vegas.

0:45:36.280,0:45:37.280
Trog: Mhmm.

0:45:37.280,0:45:38.280
Baaulp: Oh yeah.

0:45:38.280,0:45:39.890
Wayne: That is like-that would be mmm, man.

0:45:39.890,0:45:43.059
I would fly out and like, also audition if
that happened.

0:45:43.059,0:45:44.540
Like, oh man that would be amazing.

0:45:44.540,0:45:45.540
Gir: Mhmm.

0:45:45.540,0:45:46.540
Trog: Audition?

0:45:46.540,0:45:47.540
[Baaulp laughs]

0:45:47.540,0:45:48.540
Gir: You know he does auditions, don’t even—

0:45:48.540,0:45:49.540
Trog: You just mean show up?

0:45:49.540,0:45:51.630
I don’t think that there’s going to be
auditions.

0:45:51.630,0:45:56.220
Wayne: I think he does auditions, but the
terms of which you actually get put in the

0:45:56.220,0:45:59.900
movie are actually incredibly subjective and
bizarre, like—

0:45:59.900,0:46:03.770
Gir: Here’s how I guarantee I could get
in, is he would show me whatever script I’m

0:46:03.770,0:46:04.851
doing, and I’d be like, “Oh, you wrote
this?

0:46:04.851,0:46:06.400
This is incredible!”

0:46:06.400,0:46:08.750
I would just have to appeal to his fuckin’
ego [laughs].

0:46:08.750,0:46:13.500
Wayne: You just kiss his ass, just-just kiss
his bony ass and you’ll get in the movie.

0:46:13.500,0:46:15.870
Gir: “Oh man, I hope your balls are out
in this movie!”

0:46:15.870,0:46:16.870
[Baaulp, Log, and Gir laugh]

0:46:16.870,0:46:20.660
Wayne: I feel like he could—[Laughs] “Are
we gonna see you balls, Neil?”

0:46:20.660,0:46:21.660
Oh, man.

0:46:21.660,0:46:22.660
Gir: “Mister Breen!”

0:46:22.660,0:46:23.980
Wayne: The uh—“Mister Breen!”

0:46:23.980,0:46:25.540
[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

0:46:25.540,0:46:30.090
Wayne: I feel like he would turn you away
on such like, bullshit terms like, “Oh,

0:46:30.090,0:46:31.960
you’re too young and I don’t like your
hair.”

0:46:31.960,0:46:36.590
Like I feel like he’d pick some like egotistical
bullshit reasons for kicking you out.

0:46:36.590,0:46:39.170
‘Cause you know how far up bone his ass—his
own ass he is.

0:46:39.170,0:46:42.172
Baaulp: “Y’know, I don’t like that you
just came in here with a habanero and just

0:46:42.172,0:46:43.172
ate it.”

0:46:43.172,0:46:45.660
Wayne: [Laughs] “Listen, we don’t play
peppers on set.”

0:46:45.660,0:46:46.660
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] “Yeah, we don’t play
peppers on set.”

0:46:46.660,0:46:47.660
Gir: “We don’t eat anything but tuna on
this set.”

0:46:47.660,0:46:49.990
Trog: “We only play peppers if you bring
enough to share with everybody.”

0:46:49.990,0:46:50.990
[Wayne laughs]

0:46:50.990,0:46:54.599
Gir: Dude, if you walked in with a crate of
peppers you would be guaranteed to be on that

0:46:54.599,0:46:55.599
movie, I-I’m certain.

0:46:55.599,0:46:56.599
Wayne: Yeah, just bring a bunch of food.

0:46:56.599,0:47:01.300
Just gotta find out what Neil Breen’s favorite
food is and bring it to the audition and you’ll

0:47:01.300,0:47:02.300
get in the movie.

0:47:02.300,0:47:03.300
Trog: Figure out what his favorite pepper
is.

0:47:03.300,0:47:04.720
Gir: You know what his favorite food is.

0:47:04.720,0:47:05.720
Wayne: What is it?

0:47:05.720,0:47:06.720
Gir: Tuna!

0:47:06.720,0:47:07.720
Trog: It is tuna.

0:47:07.720,0:47:08.720
It’s canned tuna.

0:47:08.720,0:47:09.720
Wayne: Oh yeah!

0:47:09.720,0:47:10.720
It is tuna!

0:47:10.720,0:47:11.720
Baaulp: Cans and cans of it.

0:47:11.720,0:47:14.490
Wayne: I forgot that that’s like, that he
writes himself to eat like, twenty cans of

0:47:14.490,0:47:15.630
tuna per movie.

0:47:15.630,0:47:18.470
Trog: Alternatively, that’s just the cheapest
prop food he could find.

0:47:18.470,0:47:19.470
[Wayne laughs]

0:47:19.470,0:47:20.470
Baaulp: That’s also true.

0:47:20.470,0:47:21.470
Yeah.

0:47:21.470,0:47:22.470
Gir: Tuna’s not cheap!

0:47:22.470,0:47:23.470
Tuna is not cheap.

0:47:23.470,0:47:24.470
Trog: Canned tuna is not expensive.

0:47:24.470,0:47:27.010
Log: He doesn’t eat it at all, he scoops
it out and leaves it on the ground.

0:47:27.010,0:47:31.390
Wayne: We know from doing low budget, public
access programming that tuna is the cheapest

0:47:31.390,0:47:32.940
prize you can get for your participants.

0:47:32.940,0:47:33.940
Baaulp: Oh my god.

0:47:33.940,0:47:34.940
Trog: That’s true.

0:47:34.940,0:47:35.940
[Gir and Wayne laugh]

0:47:35.940,0:47:40.200
Log: Neil Breen, I mean, he was-he was the
one that lost at the foot of the temple of

0:47:40.200,0:47:41.770
Olmec all that time ago.

0:47:41.770,0:47:42.770
Gir: Oh.

0:47:42.770,0:47:43.770
[Wayne laughs]

0:47:43.770,0:47:44.770
Log: He still-he’s still reaping the rewards.

0:47:44.770,0:47:45.770
Wayne: They got him addicted!

0:47:45.770,0:47:46.770
[Baaulp laughs]

0:47:46.770,0:47:48.819
Wayne: He got addicted to StarKist tuna!

0:47:48.819,0:47:53.849
Log: His fall from grace started way before
his brain reached the maturity level of thirty-five.

0:47:53.849,0:47:54.849
[Wayne laughs]

0:47:54.849,0:47:56.599
Gir: Damn, he really fell from grace.

0:47:56.599,0:47:59.420
Wayne: Don’t eat tuna before you’re thirty-five
or you get addicted!

0:47:59.420,0:48:02.420
Trog: We should-we should put an age limit
on tuna.

0:48:02.420,0:48:04.561
Gir: Yeah, he was only twelve when he was
on that show, now he looks like he’s sixty.

0:48:04.561,0:48:06.450
Wayne: Do you guys like tuna?

0:48:06.450,0:48:07.450
Trog: Sure.

0:48:07.450,0:48:08.450
[Unintelligible].

0:48:08.450,0:48:09.450
Baaulp: I like real tuna!

0:48:09.450,0:48:13.490
I like tuna that’s not in can, like, I—Like,
tuna’s one of the things I like to get when

0:48:13.490,0:48:17.710
I go to sushi places, like when it’s like-whether
it’s raw or actually cooked—

0:48:17.710,0:48:18.710
Gir: Oh, you got Baaulp going.

0:48:18.710,0:48:19.710
[Wayne laughs]

0:48:19.710,0:48:20.710
Baaulp: I like tuna.

0:48:20.710,0:48:21.910
But the stuff you get out of cans like, euuhhnn.

0:48:21.910,0:48:24.030
Log: It’s weird how the difference is.

0:48:24.030,0:48:29.270
‘Cause like, yeah, you see like a piece
of red tuna on some sushi rice and you’re

0:48:29.270,0:48:30.760
like, "Yeah, that’s three hundred dollars."

0:48:30.760,0:48:31.760
[Trog laughs]

0:48:31.760,0:48:35.609
Log: Uh, and then you get a can of it and
it tastes just kind of mediocre on a sandwich.

0:48:35.609,0:48:37.090
Wayne: Well, there’s many kinds of tuna!

0:48:37.090,0:48:38.839
Baaulp: Yeah, there’s multiple kinds of
tuna.

0:48:38.839,0:48:43.480
Wayne: Do you have any foods that when you
were a kid you ate so much that you can’t

0:48:43.480,0:48:44.680
fucking stand them now?

0:48:44.680,0:48:45.730
‘Cause like for me that’s—

0:48:45.730,0:48:46.730
Trog: Yeah.

0:48:46.730,0:48:47.730
Gir: Yes, called Cheetos.

0:48:47.730,0:48:53.750
Wayne: Tuna fish, like, tuna fish sandwiches,
when from like age of zero to like, six, were

0:48:53.750,0:48:58.069
all I ate, specifically like, tuna fish sandwiches—whenever
you’d take the canned tuna you’d mix it

0:48:58.069,0:49:01.891
in with a little bit of mayonnaise, and then
like you’d put that on a sandwich and what

0:49:01.891,0:49:05.809
my mom would do specifically, I’ll never
forget this, is like, most kids when they

0:49:05.809,0:49:09.690
have a sandwich, the mom, the dad will cut
off the crust or whatever.

0:49:09.690,0:49:11.960
For me, my mom would cut it up into little
like, cubes.

0:49:11.960,0:49:17.042
So, it was little bite sized finger food pieces
of sandwich and I loved that shit and it was

0:49:17.042,0:49:18.119
all I would eat!

0:49:18.119,0:49:24.150
And now like, the smell and the sight of like,
that kind of canned tuna fish makes me want

0:49:24.150,0:49:26.940
to fucking vomit and explode.

0:49:26.940,0:49:28.040
I hate it so much.

0:49:28.040,0:49:31.410
Gir: I-I am dead certain we’ve gone over
this.

0:49:31.410,0:49:32.410
Wayne: Maybe.

0:49:32.410,0:49:33.410
Trog: Tuna?

0:49:33.410,0:49:34.410
I don’t think so.

0:49:34.410,0:49:35.410
Gir: Not just that specifically, I mean in
general.

0:49:35.410,0:49:39.309
‘Cause I do remember—‘cause you also
said something about like uh, peanut butter.

0:49:39.309,0:49:40.730
You hated peanut butter.

0:49:40.730,0:49:41.730
And then you like it again.

0:49:41.730,0:49:44.690
Wayne: I mean, we also might have talked about
that off podcast.

0:49:44.690,0:49:47.000
Trog: We also might have talked about peppers
before.

0:49:47.000,0:49:50.690
Gir: I don’t know, we can’t keep track,
there’s been too many podcasts, there’s

0:49:50.690,0:49:52.340
been eighteen of these fuckin’ things!

0:49:52.340,0:49:55.890
Wayne: Y’know, y’know, y’know, there
is—there is a dedicated fan out there who

0:49:55.890,0:49:59.950
is transcribing all of the podcasts into text
form, I bet we could ask them.

0:49:59.950,0:50:03.130
I bet we could be like, “Can you like-can
you write down like a list?”

0:50:03.130,0:50:04.130
Baaulp: They’re a scribe?

0:50:04.130,0:50:05.130
Wayne: We do have a scribe!

0:50:05.130,0:50:06.130
I wish I knew their name!

0:50:06.130,0:50:07.720
Thank you to whoever-whoever this is!

0:50:07.720,0:50:09.109
I know that they post them to the WayneRadioTV
wiki.

0:50:09.109,0:50:10.109
The um—

0:50:10.109,0:50:11.330
Baaulp: We can­-we got—Well-well thank
you.

0:50:11.330,0:50:12.460
Well, thank you.

0:50:12.460,0:50:14.579
Wayne: Thank you.

0:50:14.579,0:50:21.030
The um, but—a compiled list of every topic
we’ve ever brought up would be like, amazing.

0:50:21.030,0:50:22.599
Gir: It’d be a long list.

0:50:22.599,0:50:23.599
Trog: And we—Yeah.

0:50:23.599,0:50:24.829
Wayne: It would be a long list, but—

0:50:24.829,0:50:29.370
Baaulp: You know what, uh, I am burned out
on when it comes to food?

0:50:29.370,0:50:30.720
This one’s surprising.

0:50:30.720,0:50:31.720
Chips.

0:50:31.720,0:50:32.720
I don’t like chips.

0:50:32.720,0:50:36.830
It isn’t as bad for you, I won’t like
retch when I see chips.

0:50:36.830,0:50:43.310
If someone offers me chips I’d have like,
one or two or three, but like, I don’t-I

0:50:43.310,0:50:45.260
won’t ever buy-I won’t buy chips for myself.

0:50:45.260,0:50:48.280
Chips are just something I don’t want anymore,
y’know what I mean?

0:50:48.280,0:50:50.440
Log: I don’t care about regular potato chips.

0:50:50.440,0:50:56.339
If it’s like a special-specially cooked
potato chips, like fresh out the oil, yeah.

0:50:56.339,0:50:57.339
Those are good.

0:50:57.339,0:50:58.339
Wayne: Yeah!

0:50:58.339,0:51:02.260
That’s what I was gonna say, have you-have
you ever had like, restaurant made like, fresh,

0:51:02.260,0:51:03.880
literally just cooked potato chips?

0:51:03.880,0:51:04.880
That shit’s amazing.

0:51:04.880,0:51:05.880
Baaulp: Yeah, and—yeah, yeah!

0:51:05.880,0:51:06.880
I’ll have like, a handful.

0:51:06.880,0:51:07.880
That’s it.

0:51:07.880,0:51:10.660
I’m not gonna like, go down on ‘em, right?

0:51:10.660,0:51:11.660
And the reason—

0:51:11.660,0:51:12.660
Wayne: What’s the best—

0:51:12.660,0:51:14.350
Trog: Baaulp will not go down on chips.

0:51:14.350,0:51:15.900
You heard it here first.

0:51:15.900,0:51:16.900
[Baaulp laughs]

0:51:16.900,0:51:18.640
Wayne: What is the best appetizer you’ve
ever had?

0:51:18.640,0:51:19.640
Trog: Mozzarella sticks.

0:51:19.640,0:51:20.640
Log: Best appetizer?

0:51:20.640,0:51:21.640
Wayne: Yes.

0:51:21.640,0:51:22.640
Log: Um—

0:51:22.640,0:51:23.640
Wayne: I have a very specific answer.

0:51:23.640,0:51:32.640
Log: There’s a place around here where one
of their appetizers is like, wonton nachos,

0:51:32.640,0:51:37.849
which sounds really stupid, but it’s actually
really good ‘cause it’s y’know, the

0:51:37.849,0:51:46.770
wonton stuff and chicken and like, basically
just like—it’s like nachos but with like,

0:51:46.770,0:51:50.630
Asian ingredients instead of, y’know, Tex-Mex
type stuff.

0:51:50.630,0:51:55.450
And it winds up being really—like the wonton
in place of the nacho chip is actually really

0:51:55.450,0:51:56.450
good.

0:51:56.450,0:51:59.510
Wayne: I went to this Italian restaurant like
a while back—

0:51:59.510,0:52:00.510
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Hey Mambo, Mambo Italiano—

0:52:00.510,0:52:07.900
Wayne: —and they had an appetizer that was
called like—You said “Aye, mama,” coincidentally,

0:52:07.900,0:52:09.540
they were called mama’s chips.

0:52:09.540,0:52:10.540
They were called mama’s chips—

0:52:10.540,0:52:11.540
Gir: He said Mambo, but—

0:52:11.540,0:52:12.580
Wayne: What it-what it—Shut up.

0:52:12.580,0:52:17.990
What it was, was a plate of like super thinly
sliced eggplant—

0:52:17.990,0:52:18.990
Baaulp: Oohhhh.

0:52:18.990,0:52:23.640
Wayne: —that was then fried like they were
potato chips, so super thin, fried eggplant

0:52:23.640,0:52:28.980
chips with like, this delicious cucumber yogurt
dip that you would dip it into, oh my god—

0:52:28.980,0:52:29.980
Gir: Like tzatziki?

0:52:29.980,0:52:31.059
Wayne: Yes, the tzatziki—

0:52:31.059,0:52:32.710
Baaulp: Yo, that sounds good.

0:52:32.710,0:52:38.390
Wayne: It was so good, oh my god, I could
have ate the whole plate and been very sick.

0:52:38.390,0:52:40.460
Baaulp: You can probably replicate that at
home!

0:52:40.460,0:52:42.200
That might not be too hard!

0:52:42.200,0:52:47.690
Wayne: It was a very like, it was a very like
fine fry and cut job, it was professionally

0:52:47.690,0:52:48.690
made.

0:52:48.690,0:52:49.700
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] It was like-it was like-it
was like paper thin?

0:52:49.700,0:52:50.700
Wayne: Yes!

0:52:50.700,0:52:52.230
That’s why it was so good.

0:52:52.230,0:52:55.599
Like, for me, eggplant is—I don’t really
like eggplant.

0:52:55.599,0:52:59.630
Normally like a thick cut of eggplant I honestly
can’t stand it, but when it was this thin,

0:52:59.630,0:53:01.040
oh my god it was so good.

0:53:01.040,0:53:03.250
It removed all the texture bits I didn’t
like.

0:53:03.250,0:53:08.470
Gir: I can’t say my brain has ever logged
an appetizer on like a favorites list, I don’t

0:53:08.470,0:53:10.829
usually have many appetizers to begin with.

0:53:10.829,0:53:12.119
Wayne: Mozzarella sticks!

0:53:12.119,0:53:13.119
Perfect.

0:53:13.119,0:53:14.119
Ten out of ten.

0:53:14.119,0:53:17.670
Gir: So, I would say like mozzarella sticks
or uh, bloomin’ onion.

0:53:17.670,0:53:19.620
Wayne: [Laughs] I do love that you’re—

0:53:19.620,0:53:20.710
Gir: I don’t know.

0:53:20.710,0:53:23.760
Wayne: Like Log and I have a specific dish
from a specific restaurant, and it’s like,

0:53:23.760,0:53:25.420
“Best appetizer I’ve ever had?

0:53:25.420,0:53:26.430
Mozzarella sticks.

0:53:26.430,0:53:27.650
Does it every time.

0:53:27.650,0:53:28.650
Perfect.

0:53:28.650,0:53:29.650
Number one [laughs].”

0:53:29.650,0:53:30.890
Gir: I mean—

0:53:30.890,0:53:34.819
Trog: Literally, literally, I wish I had mozzarella
sticks right now.

0:53:34.819,0:53:35.819
I would—

0:53:35.819,0:53:36.819
Wayne: Me too!

0:53:36.819,0:53:37.819
[Unintelligible].

0:53:37.819,0:53:38.819
Trog: I would leave this podcast to go get
mozzarella sticks.

0:53:38.819,0:53:41.640
Baaulp: I might go get some mozzarella sticks
tomorrow, fuck!

0:53:41.640,0:53:45.609
Gir: I don’t usually do appetizers, I just
jump right into the main course and be done.

0:53:45.609,0:53:47.260
Wayne: I love a good appetizer!

0:53:47.260,0:53:49.080
Log: Enjoy the-enjoy the trip, MasterGir!

0:53:49.080,0:53:50.080
Wayne: Calamari?

0:53:50.080,0:53:51.080
Calamari?

0:53:51.080,0:53:52.080
Ooh!

0:53:52.080,0:53:53.080
Y’all like calamari?

0:53:53.080,0:53:54.080
Gir: I don’t eat much!

0:53:54.080,0:53:57.089
Log: You gotta eat some more!

0:53:57.089,0:53:59.040
Gir: Fuck cala—Oough, I hate squid!

0:53:59.040,0:54:00.250
Wayne: You hate calamari?

0:54:00.250,0:54:01.250
AAAH, fuck!

0:54:01.250,0:54:02.250
You crazy!

0:54:02.250,0:54:03.250
Trog: Eh, squid’s, y’know.

0:54:03.250,0:54:04.250
It’s good.

0:54:04.250,0:54:05.630
Log: Have-have some cheese fries.

0:54:05.630,0:54:06.630
Wayne: Yeah!

0:54:06.630,0:54:07.630
Poutine!

0:54:07.630,0:54:10.950
Log: Y’know, mozzarella sticks are good,
I think the favorite-I think my—Whenever

0:54:10.950,0:54:19.030
it’s not like a specialty, the thing that
I like the most, and it’s good because they’re

0:54:19.030,0:54:20.750
readily available in Texas, is fried pickles.

0:54:20.750,0:54:21.750
Trog: Those are pretty good, yeah.

0:54:21.750,0:54:22.750
Baaulp: Ohh, yeah, fried pickles are good!

0:54:22.750,0:54:25.930
Wayne: I will say, not my favorite, but I
do like ‘em.

0:54:25.930,0:54:29.990
A good plate I had at some restaurant was
like fried pickles and cheese curds, and it

0:54:29.990,0:54:30.990
was very good.

0:54:30.990,0:54:31.990
Gir: I’d try it.

0:54:31.990,0:54:35.579
I remember watching Billy and Mandy once and
one of the characters dicked-dipped a pickle

0:54:35.579,0:54:36.579
in uh, chocolate.

0:54:36.579,0:54:37.579
Wayne: They dicked.

0:54:37.579,0:54:38.920
Gir: They dicked a pickle.

0:54:38.920,0:54:41.780
Wayne: They did not—No one got dicked down
on Billy and Mandy.

0:54:41.780,0:54:44.340
Please don’t say that on our podcast.

0:54:44.340,0:54:45.810
Gir: [Laughs] Shut up!

0:54:45.810,0:54:46.910
Log: “Buenos dias.”

0:54:46.910,0:54:47.910
Gir: They di—[laughs].

0:54:47.910,0:54:48.910
Wayne: “Buenos dias, Mandy.”

0:54:48.910,0:54:49.910
Gir: They dipped a pickle in chocolate—

0:54:49.910,0:54:50.910
Wayne: [Crosstalk] “Imbecil!”

0:54:50.910,0:54:52.040
Gir: —and I was like, “Oh, that looks
gross, I’m gonna try that [laughs].”

0:54:52.040,0:54:53.040
Trog: And how was it?

0:54:53.040,0:54:54.040
Wayne: Salty sweet!

0:54:54.040,0:54:56.420
Gir: So I took a pickle and dipped it in some
like, I dipped it in some like, Nutella, and

0:54:56.420,0:54:59.000
I ate it and was like, “Oh my god, that’s
actually not bad [laughs]!”

0:54:59.000,0:55:01.790
Trog: I don’t know, I feel like a pickle
would be like, too sour for chocolate.

0:55:01.790,0:55:02.799
Gir: It was alright!

0:55:02.799,0:55:04.319
Wayne: Too sour, too juicy, maybe.

0:55:04.319,0:55:07.119
Log: Peanut butter pickles is like uh, is
like a known thing.

0:55:07.119,0:55:08.119
Trog: Really?

0:55:08.119,0:55:09.119
That’s wack.

0:55:09.119,0:55:10.119
Gir: It’s actually not bad.

0:55:10.119,0:55:13.359
Wayne: That’s a little bit more like—Like
with peanut butter, like peanut butter isn’t

0:55:13.359,0:55:16.780
just sweet, it’s more savory than sweet,
unless it’s like super sugary.

0:55:16.780,0:55:17.890
Gir: Depends on what it is.

0:55:17.890,0:55:19.880
If it’s Skippy then it’s more sweet than
anything.

0:55:19.880,0:55:24.230
Wayne: Yeah, god I love crappy peanut butter,
like Jiff is so good.

0:55:24.230,0:55:26.349
Crappy sugar, like crappy for you peanut butter.

0:55:26.349,0:55:27.349
Gir: Uh-huh.

0:55:27.349,0:55:28.349
Baaulp: Uh, we wanna…?

0:55:28.349,0:55:29.349
Wayne: Questions?

0:55:29.349,0:55:30.349
Trog: Yeah, we should probably start doing
questions.

0:55:30.349,0:55:31.349
Baaulp: Peppers?

0:55:31.349,0:55:32.349
Wayne: Peppers?

0:55:32.349,0:55:33.349
Yeah?

0:55:33.349,0:55:34.349
Baaulp: Yeah, peppers?

0:55:34.349,0:55:35.349
Gir: Peppers?

0:55:35.349,0:55:36.349
You want some peppers?

0:55:36.349,0:55:37.349
Baaulp: You want to play some peppers?

0:55:37.349,0:55:38.349
Wayne: Peasants?

0:55:38.349,0:55:40.770
Trog: First question here from PepperGamer
is just the word, “Peppers” with a question

0:55:40.770,0:55:41.770
mark.

0:55:41.770,0:55:42.770
What do you think?

0:55:42.770,0:55:43.770
Wayne: “Will you play peppers on stream?”

0:55:43.770,0:55:46.859
And the answer is yes, I’m totally—Listen,
once this podcast is live, I’m gonna do

0:55:46.859,0:55:48.720
a stream where we’re just gonna play peppers.

0:55:48.720,0:55:50.099
Baaulp: Can we actually do that?

0:55:50.099,0:55:51.099
[Unintelligible].

0:55:51.099,0:55:52.099
Wayne: Yes!

0:55:52.099,0:55:53.099
We could do it!

0:55:53.099,0:55:54.549
We could get a bunch of peppers and we’ll
come up with some rules.

0:55:54.549,0:55:56.240
Trog: We will not.

0:55:56.240,0:55:58.349
Log: Here’s your pepper, bro.

0:55:58.349,0:55:59.349
[Wayne laughs]

0:55:59.349,0:56:05.880
Log: And it’s uh, you ever have your friend
pass you the weird third-party pepper and

0:56:05.880,0:56:07.109
it’s covered in Cheeto dust?

0:56:07.109,0:56:12.060
Trog: [Laughs] Yeah, you get our extra pepper
that we don’t use unless we have guests

0:56:12.060,0:56:13.060
over.

0:56:13.060,0:56:14.829
Wayne: Your Mad Catz pepper.

0:56:14.829,0:56:18.920
Log: Yeah, Madz Cat-Mad Catz pepper with the
see-through skin.

0:56:18.920,0:56:19.920
Gir: Yeah.

0:56:19.920,0:56:20.920
Wayne: Eeuugh.

0:56:20.920,0:56:21.920
Baaulp: Oh, no.

0:56:21.920,0:56:22.920
Extra seeds?

0:56:22.920,0:56:23.920
Log: The seeds are bright orange.

0:56:23.920,0:56:25.640
Gir: They just hand you a handful of seeds.

0:56:25.640,0:56:27.610
Trog: Alright, this is all we have.

0:56:27.610,0:56:33.099
Wayne: Eating a handful of jalapeno seeds
would just be an awful experience, just a

0:56:33.099,0:56:36.750
nightmarish encounter in life with those seeds.

0:56:36.750,0:56:39.160
Gir: That’s how you’d kill a peasant,
for like, for real.

0:56:39.160,0:56:40.160
[Wayne laughs]

0:56:40.160,0:56:41.480
Baaulp: But hey, y’know, if you’re down
I’m down.

0:56:41.480,0:56:46.640
Let’s play peppers.

0:56:46.640,0:56:56.450
Wayne: Peppers.

0:56:56.450,0:57:10.859
Wayne: Alright, first question from Zekiran,
“If you were a lich, what object would you

0:57:10.859,0:57:13.520
store your spirit in to keep it safe?”

0:57:13.520,0:57:18.049
Now, this is both—This is a question of
both like an object of importance to you,

0:57:18.049,0:57:21.470
but also, what is the smartest pick?

0:57:21.470,0:57:23.780
Like, what is this called?

0:57:23.780,0:57:25.109
A phylactery or something like that?

0:57:25.109,0:57:26.250
Baaulp: Yeah, phylactery, yeah.

0:57:26.250,0:57:27.250
Wayne: Phylactery?

0:57:27.250,0:57:32.089
Yeah, like you want to pick one that the-that
the adventurer who’s questing to kill you

0:57:32.089,0:57:36.980
and take out your lichliness from this world,
you want to put it somewhere they’d never

0:57:36.980,0:57:39.970
expect, or somewhere they could never get
to, where do you put your soul?

0:57:39.970,0:57:40.970
Gir: Easy.

0:57:40.970,0:57:41.970
Log: Nintendo DS.

0:57:41.970,0:57:42.970
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

0:57:42.970,0:57:43.970
Gir: You kidding me?

0:57:43.970,0:57:44.970
Wayne: Which one?

0:57:44.970,0:57:45.970
Gir: What color?

0:57:45.970,0:57:50.240
Trog: Funny that you would choose that one,
because I was thinking of picking a Wii U

0:57:50.240,0:57:54.010
because nobody wants to touch it or look at
it, so, it’d be pretty safe.

0:57:54.010,0:57:55.010
[Baaulp laughs]

0:57:55.010,0:57:59.050
Gir: My answer is-should be the obvious one,
where it’s uh, fake dog turd.

0:57:59.050,0:58:00.050
Trog: Yeah?

0:58:00.050,0:58:01.050
So obvious.

0:58:01.050,0:58:03.430
Baaulp: Just some like Dollar Store prank
toy?

0:58:03.430,0:58:07.240
Gir: Yeah, no one would bat an eye, nobody
would touch it if it was inside, they’d

0:58:07.240,0:58:08.240
be like, “Ooh, that’s gross.

0:58:08.240,0:58:09.240
I’m not going near that.”

0:58:09.240,0:58:11.349
If it was outside they would even like, notice
it.

0:58:11.349,0:58:15.770
Baaulp: But like, you’d have to protect
it, so it’d be a dog turd in a box.

0:58:15.770,0:58:16.809
Like, it’s like, obvious.

0:58:16.809,0:58:19.810
Gir: They go, “Oh, I got pranked,” and
close the box again.

0:58:19.810,0:58:23.990
Wayne: I would put mine inside of Asimo the
robot.

0:58:23.990,0:58:25.010
[Baaulp laughs]

0:58:25.010,0:58:26.030
Trog: Uh-huh.

0:58:26.030,0:58:30.390
Wayne: I would-I would put my soul in there
and like, everyone loves Asimo, no one would

0:58:30.390,0:58:35.020
want to hurt him, and like, he’d be walking
around so he’s on the go, so you can never

0:58:35.020,0:58:36.349
find him in one consistent place.

0:58:36.349,0:58:37.349
Trog: Yeah.

0:58:37.349,0:58:42.109
Baaulp: One problem, I’ll enlist the help
of the mighty warrior, a warrior immune to

0:58:42.109,0:58:48.559
Asimo’s charms, one who thinks Asimo is
lazy-a lazy good for nothin’ oaf.

0:58:48.559,0:58:51.650
Wayne: Hmm, maybe I take it back.

0:58:51.650,0:58:52.650
I think Baaulp’s is [laughs]—

0:58:52.650,0:58:53.650
Baaulp: You know who?

0:58:53.650,0:58:54.650
You know who?

0:58:54.650,0:58:55.650
Trog: Baaulp’s just poked a giant hole in
your theory.

0:58:55.650,0:58:57.359
Gir: No, the flaw here—You’re not even
thinking.

0:58:57.359,0:59:01.940
The flaw here is Asimo would fall down a flight
of stairs and destroy himself [laughs]!

0:59:01.940,0:59:02.940
Wayne: Oh yeah!

0:59:02.940,0:59:05.369
What if he falls down the stairs and my soul
cracks and dies!

0:59:05.369,0:59:07.690
“So cry me a fucking river!

0:59:07.690,0:59:08.690
DIE!”

0:59:08.690,0:59:09.690
The fuckin’ [laughs]—

0:59:09.690,0:59:12.140
Log: Asimo is constantly in danger.

0:59:12.140,0:59:13.140
Gir: Yeah!

0:59:13.140,0:59:14.140
From himself!

0:59:14.140,0:59:16.520
Wayne: Okay, okay, because I just fucking
screamed that and no one’s gonna know what

0:59:16.520,0:59:21.799
it is, we got a Video of the Times for this
podcast is, uh, “Asimo Brutal Stair Fall,”

0:59:21.799,0:59:23.150
or whatever the fuck it was called.

0:59:23.150,0:59:25.410
It’s a really good video of Asimo—You’ll
see.

0:59:25.410,0:59:26.670
Trog: Doesn’t even know the title.

0:59:26.670,0:59:28.800
I think it is called—Let’s see [typing
sounds].

0:59:28.800,0:59:32.160
Wayne: That’s literally—It’s like, “Brutal
Stair Fall,” or something like that.

0:59:32.160,0:59:35.839
Baaulp: Yeah, and then Karl Pilkington would
come out and just rip its head off.

0:59:35.839,0:59:37.160
Wayne: Okay, I need a better one than Asimo.

0:59:37.160,0:59:41.010
Trog: Yeah, it’s literally just called,
“Asimo’s BRUTAL Stair Fall,” that’s

0:59:41.010,0:59:43.109
the Video of the Times.

0:59:43.109,0:59:45.070
Wayne: I got it—

0:59:45.070,0:59:47.370
Log: Anyways, a Nintendo DS is good because
it’s fun and compact and you can’t break

0:59:47.370,0:59:48.440
it even if you want to.

0:59:48.440,0:59:49.440
Trog: Mhmm.

0:59:49.440,0:59:50.540
Wayne: In the Elephant’s Foot.

0:59:50.540,0:59:52.710
Log: Oh, they have to make a sacrifice.

0:59:52.710,0:59:53.710
Gir: What?

0:59:53.710,0:59:57.079
Wayne: I would use my lich powers to put it
in there safely, ‘cause I’m a lich, I’d

0:59:57.079,0:59:59.010
be able to endure the radiation.

0:59:59.010,1:00:00.480
And I can put it in the Elephant’s Foot.

1:00:00.480,1:00:01.829
I literally would be unstoppable.

1:00:01.829,1:00:02.990
Gir: What is the Elephant’s Foot?

1:00:02.990,1:00:03.990
Baaulp: You don’t know?

1:00:03.990,1:00:06.180
Wayne: The Elephant’s Foot is the center
of Chernobyl.

1:00:06.180,1:00:09.510
Like it is-it is ground zero of the Chernobyl
nuclear disaster.

1:00:09.510,1:00:10.590
Gir: Oh, okay.

1:00:10.590,1:00:11.590
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:00:11.590,1:00:13.089
Wayne: Have you-do you—Have you ever seen
a picture of it?

1:00:13.089,1:00:14.089
Look it up, it’s crazy.

1:00:14.089,1:00:16.630
Gir: I have—No, I know, I just didn’t
know that is what it was called.

1:00:16.630,1:00:21.309
Log: It’s a-it’s a vile pile of sludge,
and they’ve only been able to take pictures

1:00:21.309,1:00:25.680
of it with like a little robotic camera, ‘cause
if somebody else got close to it—

1:00:25.680,1:00:27.320
Wayne: You’d be dead in a day.

1:00:27.320,1:00:29.590
Log: They’d become-they’d become part
of the foot.

1:00:29.590,1:00:30.590
Trog: Ough, scary.

1:00:30.590,1:00:36.000
Wayne: I guess that means someone could still
kill me, but you’d have to, you’d literally

1:00:36.000,1:00:37.079
have to sacrifice yourself.

1:00:37.079,1:00:38.079
Like—

1:00:38.079,1:00:39.220
Baaulp: It’d be another-it’d be another
lich.

1:00:39.220,1:00:43.050
Wayne: Yeah, it’s a never-ending curse,
I hex the phylactery so that if you break

1:00:43.050,1:00:44.099
it, you become a lich.

1:00:44.099,1:00:46.910
Trog: But then, that’s like a reward for
some people.

1:00:46.910,1:00:48.680
Gir: Can you force somebody to be a lich?

1:00:48.680,1:00:49.680
Trog: Probably.

1:00:49.680,1:00:52.079
Wayne: It’s not real, you can’t-you can’t
do that.

1:00:52.079,1:00:53.510
You can’t become a lich, either.

1:00:53.510,1:00:54.510
Gir: Wayne, you’re breaking the rules.

1:00:54.510,1:00:55.849
Wayne: This isn’t-this is all fantasy.

1:00:55.849,1:00:59.799
Log: If I were a lich, I’d simply be nice
and then nobody would try to destroy my phylactery.

1:00:59.799,1:01:00.799
[Baaulp laughs]

1:01:00.799,1:01:01.799
Wayne: That’s true.

1:01:01.799,1:01:02.799
Baaulp: That’s a good tactic.

1:01:02.799,1:01:04.289
Trog: That’s a good idea.

1:01:04.289,1:01:08.359
Baaulp: You did the opposite, you’d-you’d
be like, “You wanna play on my DS?

1:01:08.359,1:01:09.359
That’s me!”

1:01:09.359,1:01:10.359
Gir: Stored in the moon.

1:01:10.359,1:01:11.359
Trog: That’s cheating.

1:01:11.359,1:01:12.359
Wayne: But then Neil Armstrong will get you.

1:01:12.359,1:01:14.630
Trog: Yeah, I’m gonna store it in uh, Alpha
Centauri.

1:01:14.630,1:01:17.160
That’s my phylactery, is the entire uh,
star system.

1:01:17.160,1:01:19.380
Gir: You can’t store it in a star!

1:01:19.380,1:01:22.480
Wayne: Buzz Aldrin will come and fuck your
soul up, bro.

1:01:22.480,1:01:24.099
Gir: He’s never makin’ it back.

1:01:24.099,1:01:26.450
Wayne: [Laughs] No, he’s goin’ back, that’s
where he’s gonna die.

1:01:26.450,1:01:28.800
Gir: This time he goes back he’ll be in
a cup.

1:01:28.800,1:01:30.359
Baaulp: Damn, bro.

1:01:30.359,1:01:32.089
Wayne: That’s rude to Buzz Aldrin.

1:01:32.089,1:01:33.089
Gir: [Laughs] It’s true!

1:01:33.089,1:01:36.200
Trog: Can you make a public apology to Buzz
Aldrin on our podcast.

1:01:36.200,1:01:37.200
[Wayne laughs]

1:01:37.200,1:01:40.010
Baaulp: Yeah, make a public apology to Buzz
Aldrin right now.

1:01:40.010,1:01:44.060
Gir: Buzz Aldrin, I’m sorry that the next
time you get to the moon you will be nothing

1:01:44.060,1:01:45.060
but ashes.

1:01:45.060,1:01:49.510
Wayne: I mean if-if we’re doing that, now
I have to apologize to Queen Elizabeth for

1:01:49.510,1:01:52.530
threatening to make her smoke a ghost pepper
or whatever.

1:01:52.530,1:01:54.520
[Gir and Wayne laugh]

1:01:54.520,1:01:59.100
Wayne: I mean, Log, if you’re a nice lich,
the thing is you’re gonna get some meanies

1:01:59.100,1:02:02.730
coming after you, and you’re gonna have
like, some fuckin’, like, “Oh, I hate

1:02:02.730,1:02:04.770
that guy, I hate that lich, he’s too nice
to people.”

1:02:04.770,1:02:08.869
Trog: He’s gonna have fun adventures, he’s
gonna be like a children’s cartoon character.

1:02:08.869,1:02:09.869
[Wayne laughs]

1:02:09.869,1:02:11.130
Trog: Fun Lich.

1:02:11.130,1:02:12.809
Wayne: Log the friendly lich.

1:02:12.809,1:02:18.619
Baaulp: If Wayne’s answer is the Elephant’s
Foot, my answer is Wayne.

1:02:18.619,1:02:19.619
Wayne will be my phylactery.

1:02:19.619,1:02:20.619
So it’ll be another lich!

1:02:20.619,1:02:21.619
Wayne: Yo, a chain of liches!

1:02:21.619,1:02:22.619
Baaulp: Yeah [laughs!]

1:02:22.619,1:02:23.619
Trog: Pretty smart.

1:02:23.619,1:02:24.619
Wayne: That’s kind of cool.

1:02:24.619,1:02:28.539
Baaulp: But it’s like a cascading effect
where if someone makes it to the Elephant’s

1:02:28.539,1:02:30.869
Foot and takes you down, it’s like a chain
reaction.

1:02:30.869,1:02:31.869
Wayne: Yeah.

1:02:31.869,1:02:33.079
Gir: Store your souls in each other.

1:02:33.079,1:02:34.550
Wayne: The source of all liches.

1:02:34.550,1:02:38.620
The issue there, though, is that if someone
like, tries to fight me and attack me, and

1:02:38.620,1:02:42.060
they deal a decisive blow, I won’t die,
but you will.

1:02:42.060,1:02:43.839
Baaulp: No, because you’re not dead!

1:02:43.839,1:02:44.839
You’re a lich!

1:02:44.839,1:02:48.619
Wayne: Well, but no, your phylactery—I-this
is hurting my head, this isn’t real.

1:02:48.619,1:02:49.980
Liches aren’t real, hopefully.

1:02:49.980,1:02:50.980
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:02:50.980,1:02:52.370
Wayne: Let’s move on [laughs].

1:02:52.370,1:02:55.430
Baaulp: Good thing liches aren’t real, that’s
our answer.

1:02:55.430,1:02:57.140
This is a good one.

1:02:57.140,1:03:00.760
I don’t have an answer for this, but you
guys might.

1:03:00.760,1:03:04.390
“What nightmare creatures haunted your mind
as a young child?

1:03:04.390,1:03:05.390
For example—”

1:03:05.390,1:03:07.190
Gir: Who asked that?

1:03:07.190,1:03:09.140
Baaulp: Uh… someone named Grungle.

1:03:09.140,1:03:10.140
Gir: Mhmm.

1:03:10.140,1:03:14.619
Baaulp: Now I have to do-do it all over again
from the top, thank you, MasterGir.

1:03:14.619,1:03:15.619
Gir: Yeah, you’re welcome.

1:03:15.619,1:03:16.619
Wayne: Do it.

1:03:16.619,1:03:19.339
Trog: Well, you didn’t say his name, you
do have to do it all over again.

1:03:19.339,1:03:20.339
Gir: Yeah!

1:03:20.339,1:03:21.339
Baaulp: I didn’t finish reading it!

1:03:21.339,1:03:22.339
Oh my god.

1:03:22.339,1:03:23.339
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

1:03:23.339,1:03:24.339
Gir: He’s supposed to say who’s so-and-so
last!

1:03:24.339,1:03:25.339
Trog: You’re supposed to say the name first!

1:03:25.339,1:03:26.790
Wayne: From the top!

1:03:26.790,1:03:27.790
From the top.

1:03:27.790,1:03:29.760
Baaulp: No, I don’t have to do that, I’m
reading the email as is!

1:03:29.760,1:03:30.760
Wayne: FROM THE TOP!

1:03:30.760,1:03:31.760
[Trog and Gir laugh]

1:03:31.760,1:03:32.760
Baaulp: Oh my god.

1:03:32.760,1:03:35.119
“What nightmare creatures haunted your mind
as a young child?

1:03:35.119,1:03:40.289
For example, the two creatures I was really
afraid of as a kid were the zombie cat from

1:03:40.289,1:03:44.990
a Goosebumps direct-to-video movie, and a
dead baboon.”

1:03:44.990,1:03:45.990
Woah.

1:03:45.990,1:03:46.990
Trog: Wow.

1:03:46.990,1:03:47.990
Wayne: Woah.

1:03:47.990,1:03:49.950
Baaulp: “I thought they both lived in the
dark hallway outside my room [laughs].”

1:03:49.950,1:03:50.950
[Wayne laughs]

1:03:50.950,1:03:51.950
Trog: Wow.

1:03:51.950,1:03:54.130
Wayne: A fucking undead baboon!

1:03:54.130,1:03:55.130
That’s awesome.

1:03:55.130,1:03:58.440
Baaulp: “Were you haunted by any imaginary
terrors?

1:03:58.440,1:03:59.599
Or were you fearless?

1:03:59.599,1:04:00.599
Sincerely, Grungle.”

1:04:00.599,1:04:03.190
Wayne: Uh, I have a few answers.

1:04:03.190,1:04:05.740
So, Baaulp, you don’t have an answer at
the moment?

1:04:05.740,1:04:12.000
Baaulp: I-I might not have a good answer,
‘cause, okay, what spooked me as a kid—I-I’ve

1:04:12.000,1:04:16.660
said this before, but I watched a lot of History
Channel as a kid, I thought Hitler would come

1:04:16.660,1:04:17.660
to get me.

1:04:17.660,1:04:18.660
Gir: That’s awesome.

1:04:18.660,1:04:19.660
[Wayne laughs]

1:04:19.660,1:04:20.660
Trog: That is not a fictional person.

1:04:20.660,1:04:24.150
Baaulp: That one was weird because I also-I-I
knew how irrational that was because all those

1:04:24.150,1:04:29.160
Hitler documentaries talked about how Hitler
ended his own life-took his own life in the

1:04:29.160,1:04:30.549
bunkers, so I knew Hitler wasn’t around
anymore, but it was just like—

1:04:30.549,1:04:31.549
Gir: He became a lich.

1:04:31.549,1:04:32.549
Baaulp: [Laughs] Oh no.

1:04:32.549,1:04:36.029
Wayne: I had that fear, too, after I watched
Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn.

1:04:36.029,1:04:39.670
I was scared that Hitler would escape Other
World, but I knew Goten would protect me.

1:04:39.670,1:04:43.960
Trog: I thought you were gonna say, “I thought
Jenemba was gonna come and get me.”

1:04:43.960,1:04:44.960
[Everyone laughs]

1:04:44.960,1:04:46.150
Wayne: That too.

1:04:46.150,1:04:48.020
I was so scared of Jenemba.

1:04:48.020,1:04:53.299
Baaulp: The other thing that legitimately
kind of spooked me but like, I also knew they

1:04:53.299,1:04:55.120
weren’t real, was aliens.

1:04:55.120,1:04:59.380
I thought aliens were-I thought aliens were
scary, ‘cause they’re y’know, literally

1:04:59.380,1:05:03.170
otherworldly, but I also knew they wouldn’t
like, do anything.

1:05:03.170,1:05:07.690
I thought-like, I was a very grounded kid,
I knew like, “Okay, this is scary, but I

1:05:07.690,1:05:09.870
also don’t-can’t be real.”

1:05:09.870,1:05:13.660
Wayne: I know someone that is genuinely afraid
of aliens and it’s so funny to me.

1:05:13.660,1:05:14.660
Baaulp: Really?

1:05:14.660,1:05:22.880
Wayne: Like, it-it just cracks me the fuck
up, but uh, my uh, so my nightmare demons

1:05:22.880,1:05:29.480
when I was a child, I—The first one I’ve
told stories about on stream many times, but

1:05:29.480,1:05:35.190
there was a cow uh, we had a vacuum cover
for our vacuum cleaner that resided in the

1:05:35.190,1:05:42.930
living room that was like a cow woman, uh,
it was like-it was like a cow in like a old

1:05:42.930,1:05:49.569
timey, colonial maid outfit, and it was pretty
big, and it would rest on top of a vacuum

1:05:49.569,1:05:52.440
cleaner ‘cause it was supposed to cover
it and like hide it from the room.

1:05:52.440,1:05:57.190
So it was like, six to seven feet tall, and
it towered over me as like a young four year

1:05:57.190,1:05:58.190
old—

1:05:58.190,1:05:59.190
[Trog laughs]

1:05:59.190,1:06:01.750
Wayne: —and its soulless black eyes fucking
terrified me.

1:06:01.750,1:06:06.020
Its size, its look, everything about it terrified
me to the point that I would consistently,

1:06:06.020,1:06:09.250
constantly have nightmares that it would kill
my mom and take over.

1:06:09.250,1:06:10.250
Baaulp: Ough.

1:06:10.250,1:06:13.680
Wayne: And just like, like over and over I
never stopped having those nightmares until

1:06:13.680,1:06:14.800
they got rid of it.

1:06:14.800,1:06:18.329
And then, the first time they got rid of it,
I found it in their closet, and I was like,

1:06:18.329,1:06:19.329
“Fuck you!

1:06:19.329,1:06:20.470
You said you got rid of it!

1:06:20.470,1:06:21.470
You said you killed it!”

1:06:21.470,1:06:24.070
I was so—I felt so betrayed.

1:06:24.070,1:06:30.190
Um, second, I remember that the very first
time—Like, the very first night that I slept

1:06:30.190,1:06:34.619
in my new house the first time that I moved
when I was a kid, I had this nightmare of

1:06:34.619,1:06:39.680
these like, two Muppets with like, noodle
arms, that were just standing over my bed

1:06:39.680,1:06:43.869
waiting for me to wake up, to prove that I
was alive so that they could kill me.

1:06:43.869,1:06:47.359
Baaulp: Oh shit, that’s brutal, that’s
like—Holy shit!

1:06:47.359,1:06:51.160
Wayne: They had like, giant mouths and super
long arms and they just kept talking to each

1:06:51.160,1:06:53.829
other like, “If he opens his eyes, we’re
gonna eat him!

1:06:53.829,1:06:58.440
We’re gonna—” And then I remember the
nightmare ended with like-the nightmare ended

1:06:58.440,1:07:01.380
with like I moved a little bit and they were
like, “He’s awake!”

1:07:01.380,1:07:05.710
And they grabbed me and started swinging me
around the room in a 360 like a giant swing,

1:07:05.710,1:07:06.960
like King from Tekken.

1:07:06.960,1:07:09.450
Trog: Somebody is going to draw this now.

1:07:09.450,1:07:10.450
[Wayne laughs]

1:07:10.450,1:07:11.750
Trog: You’ve willed this into existence.

1:07:11.750,1:07:14.240
Gir: He had a Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared
dream.

1:07:14.240,1:07:15.240
Trog: Yeah.

1:07:15.240,1:07:17.640
Wayne: They kind of were like Don’t Hug
Me I’m Scared characters, they were like

1:07:17.640,1:07:24.300
weird, eyeless Muppets with like, big, Pacman
mouths, yeah, and then—That one wasn’t

1:07:24.300,1:07:27.850
reoccurring, but that is the most vivid childhood
nightmare I ever had.

1:07:27.850,1:07:30.850
Baaulp: Yeah, that sounds very distinct.

1:07:30.850,1:07:33.089
That sounds like it’d scare the shit out
of me as a kid.

1:07:33.089,1:07:37.970
Wayne: The scariest part to me was-was like,
the very clear concept that these two, this

1:07:37.970,1:07:42.810
mother and baby Muppet puppet were like, “I
can’t wait till he wakes up so we can kill

1:07:42.810,1:07:43.810
him!

1:07:43.810,1:07:45.020
But if he never opens his eyes, he’s probably
dead.”

1:07:45.020,1:07:46.670
Or like, whatever the fuck they were saying.

1:07:46.670,1:07:48.880
Trog: Why-why did you have to be…

1:07:48.880,1:07:54.410
I mean, I guess you have to be alive for them
to kill you, but it’s like, the fact that

1:07:54.410,1:07:58.590
they would wait for you to show that you were
alive before attacking you is—

1:07:58.590,1:07:59.590
Wayne: [Laughs] I don’t know!

1:07:59.590,1:08:00.590
They wanted to see my fear.

1:08:00.590,1:08:01.590
I don’t know.

1:08:01.590,1:08:02.590
Trog: I guess so.

1:08:02.590,1:08:03.590
Gir: They didn’t want to waste their time.

1:08:03.590,1:08:09.109
Trog: Talking about aliens, ironically enough,
my childhood nightmare reoccurring nightmare

1:08:09.109,1:08:14.240
demon, and this is not a joke, even though
it’s going to sound like it, it was the

1:08:14.240,1:08:17.100
blue aliens from the Eiffel 65 Blue music
video.

1:08:17.100,1:08:18.100
Gir: No.

1:08:18.100,1:08:19.100
Wayne: OH MY GOD!

1:08:19.100,1:08:20.100
Baaulp Oh.

1:08:20.100,1:08:21.100
My.

1:08:21.100,1:08:22.100
God.

1:08:22.100,1:08:23.100
Wayne: Zorotl?

1:08:23.100,1:08:25.069
Trog: So that-that song came out probably
like, what?

1:08:25.069,1:08:27.720
I probably was like six or seven years old—

1:08:27.720,1:08:28.720
Baaupl: Oh.

1:08:28.720,1:08:29.720
My god.

1:08:29.720,1:08:33.529
Trog: —so first or second grade, just freaked
the shit out of me, I saw it on TV on like

1:08:33.529,1:08:36.940
the Disney Channel once and I like, couldn’t
sleep for months.

1:08:36.940,1:08:38.130
Gir: That’s insane.

1:08:38.130,1:08:41.509
Baaulp: We-we love Zorotl, how come you’ve
never talked about this?

1:08:41.509,1:08:45.330
Trog: Oh yeah, no, now-now I look and it’s
like I fucking love this shit, it’s so funny

1:08:45.330,1:08:50.600
because yeah, as a child, absolutely hated
it, made me hate the band Eiffel 65, nowadays

1:08:50.600,1:08:57.299
I’m totally into the shitty 90’s CGI aesthetic,
so, I’ve done a full 180 on that opinion.

1:08:57.299,1:08:58.640
Baaulp: You got over it.

1:08:58.640,1:08:59.640
Yeah.

1:08:59.640,1:09:04.109
Trog: But, at the time, fuck Zorotl, fuck
blue—Those things scared the shit out of

1:09:04.109,1:09:05.109
me as a child.

1:09:05.109,1:09:06.109
Baaulp: That’s so funny.

1:09:06.109,1:09:07.109
That’s so funny.

1:09:07.109,1:09:10.270
Gir: I’ve already talked about—and I’m
pretty sure it was on the podcast—how I

1:09:10.270,1:09:14.370
had like a Woody toy that scared me so bad
I buried him in my backyard.

1:09:14.370,1:09:17.790
What I haven’t talked about was another
toy that was given to me that scared the shit

1:09:17.790,1:09:24.190
out of me, which was like, some like walking,
talking pig toy?

1:09:24.190,1:09:26.089
And I don’t know what it was about this
thing, but—

1:09:26.089,1:09:27.089
Baaulp: Walking, talking pig toy?

1:09:27.089,1:09:29.210
Gir: It-you know like when a toy walks it
does like, kind of like a waddle—

1:09:29.210,1:09:30.210
Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

1:09:30.210,1:09:34.920
Gir: And it like, it had like little voice
lines, but something about that pig, I-this

1:09:34.920,1:09:39.400
was when I was like maybe five, so it was
a long time ago, something about that pig

1:09:39.400,1:09:41.200
scared me so.

1:09:41.200,1:09:42.339
Fucking.

1:09:42.339,1:09:43.480
Bad.

1:09:43.480,1:09:48.609
That I chucked that motherfucker into my closet
and buried him under so much shit and made

1:09:48.609,1:09:50.980
sure that closet door never opened again.

1:09:50.980,1:09:54.460
Trog: I’m surprised that you didn’t just
bury them outside, too, y’know like?

1:09:54.460,1:09:56.790
Just start like a little collection out there
of nightmares.

1:09:56.790,1:10:01.150
Gir: That was my first burying, it was just
underneath of items instead of dirt.

1:10:01.150,1:10:03.060
Trog: My first burying.

1:10:03.060,1:10:04.690
Gir: My first burial.

1:10:04.690,1:10:09.670
Log: Yeah, for me it was uh, the Sleestak
from Land of the Lost.

1:10:09.670,1:10:10.670
Gir: What?

1:10:10.670,1:10:11.670
Trog: I don’t know what that is.

1:10:11.670,1:10:12.670
Log: The Sle—

1:10:12.670,1:10:13.670
Gir: What?

1:10:13.670,1:10:14.670
Trog: Describe it.

1:10:14.670,1:10:15.670
Log: The Sleestak from Land of the Lost, it’s
like a lizardman.

1:10:15.670,1:10:18.870
And it’s like a-it’s like a lizardman
from a sixties show, so y’know.

1:10:18.870,1:10:19.870
Trog: Mhmm.

1:10:19.870,1:10:23.719
Log: I wasn’t afraid of them whenever I
was awake, but I would always have nightmares

1:10:23.719,1:10:28.090
about the Sleestaks that lived in the first
floor of my house, and if I went down to the

1:10:28.090,1:10:30.360
first floor, the chase was on.

1:10:30.360,1:10:32.000
And I’d have to run from the Sleestaks.

1:10:32.000,1:10:37.080
Trog: I typed in “Sleestak,” into Google
Images and I like that the first-or I typed

1:10:37.080,1:10:43.150
it into Google, and I like that the first
like, autocomplete was, “Sleestak images.”

1:10:43.150,1:10:46.150
People are just wild to see pictures of this
guy.

1:10:46.150,1:10:52.780
Wayne: I have one more, it wasn’t mine,
but it-it is one that my friend told me about,

1:10:52.780,1:10:56.179
like of something he experienced, that has
always stuck me as one of the funniest childhood

1:10:56.179,1:10:57.179
nightmares.

1:10:57.179,1:11:02.239
He-to him, the scariest nightmare he ever
had was like, he must have been like five,

1:11:02.239,1:11:08.179
he had a nightmare that he was in an empty
white void and eventually, after a certain

1:11:08.179,1:11:12.989
amount of time, a purple machine appeared
in front of him, and on top of it was Fred

1:11:12.989,1:11:18.060
or another character from Scooby-Doo, uh,
with a broom, sweeping the machine.

1:11:18.060,1:11:21.929
And it was-to him, he described it as like,
the deepest fear he’s ever felt.

1:11:21.929,1:11:26.640
And like, that is so funny to me, just indescribable,
incomprehensible fear.

1:11:26.640,1:11:27.739
[Trog laughs]

1:11:27.739,1:11:29.420
Gir: That’s just insane.

1:11:29.420,1:11:31.210
Trog: Brain chemicals are weird.

1:11:31.210,1:11:35.969
It’s so dumb, like, I-I have dreams, I can’t
remember the last time I had like, a true

1:11:35.969,1:11:42.120
nightmare, but I have like stress dreams and
anxiety dreams, and brains are so dumb because

1:11:42.120,1:11:47.100
even if I am having a stress dream that I’m
like, “This is a dream,” it still, like

1:11:47.100,1:11:51.590
the chemicals in your brain don’t go away,
it doesn’t matter if you realize that it’s

1:11:51.590,1:11:53.850
a dream, you still are going to freak out.

1:11:53.850,1:11:56.330
Gir: I mostly just get annoyance.

1:11:56.330,1:11:59.250
Like the worst the dream will get will be,
I’ll be annoyed.

1:11:59.250,1:12:01.600
I don’t really get even stressed anymore.

1:12:01.600,1:12:05.020
Wayne: For me, if like the stress trickles
into a dream, it doesn’t matter what the

1:12:05.020,1:12:09.139
fuck was happening in the dream, like just
something that I deem stressful that I don’t

1:12:09.139,1:12:10.960
want to happen in my real life will just happen.

1:12:10.960,1:12:14.310
Like I’ll be like, venturing through a castle,
and then like, I’ll start to feel that little

1:12:14.310,1:12:17.969
bit of stress, and all of a sudden Jazz will
fly out of my shirt and out a window and I’ll

1:12:17.969,1:12:18.969
be like, “No!

1:12:18.969,1:12:19.969
He’s gone!”

1:12:19.969,1:12:20.969
Trog: Yeah [laughs].

1:12:20.969,1:12:22.070
Wayne: And then I gotta stop questing and
go get my fucking pet bird.

1:12:22.070,1:12:23.070
Trog: Yeah.

1:12:23.070,1:12:24.070
Okay—

1:12:24.070,1:12:25.070
[Wayne laughs]

1:12:25.070,1:12:28.780
Trog: This is not related directly to the
question, but, I-I have a quick question about

1:12:28.780,1:12:31.440
dreams just because I was thinking about it
earlier today.

1:12:31.440,1:12:34.920
Have you guys ever gotten hurt in a dream?

1:12:34.920,1:12:38.200
Like-like have you felt physical pain while
dreaming?

1:12:38.200,1:12:39.389
Baaulp: What do you mean?

1:12:39.389,1:12:42.840
Wayne: Uh, like Frankie Muniz getting shot
by the bullets and feeling the burn?

1:12:42.840,1:12:44.120
[Baaulp laughs]

1:12:44.120,1:12:45.960
Gir: Uhm, kind of.

1:12:45.960,1:12:51.900
Trog: I, every once in a while, will actually
experience pain in a dream, and it’s really-and

1:12:51.900,1:12:53.199
it freaks me out.

1:12:53.199,1:12:54.500
Baaulp: That sounds so—What?

1:12:54.500,1:12:58.070
Trog: Yeah, and it’s like, I mean it-it
makes sense, right?

1:12:58.070,1:13:00.570
Pain is just a thing that your brain does—

1:13:00.570,1:13:02.380
Gir: A brain reaction, yeah.

1:13:02.380,1:13:07.170
Trog: So it’s like, earlier today, literally
earlier today, I was taking a nap, I don’t

1:13:07.170,1:13:11.060
even remember what the dream was about, I
was in some kind of forest, I reached down

1:13:11.060,1:13:17.730
into a plant, and my brain told me that that
plant was like, poisonous acid, and it made-it

1:13:17.730,1:13:19.980
like hurt my hand so bad that I woke up.

1:13:19.980,1:13:20.980
Baaulp: Woah!

1:13:20.980,1:13:21.980
Wayne: That’s crazy!

1:13:21.980,1:13:22.980
Gir: Oh, wow.

1:13:22.980,1:13:23.980
Baaulp: What?

1:13:23.980,1:13:24.980
Gir: That-that’s pretty intense.

1:13:24.980,1:13:26.730
Wayne: For-for me, almost any time like pain
would happen I get jolted out of it.

1:13:26.730,1:13:27.730
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:13:27.730,1:13:31.170
Wayne: Like-like for me, if a dream gets too
stressful, my go-to is to kill myself instantly.

1:13:31.170,1:13:32.870
[Gir, Trog, and Log laugh]

1:13:32.870,1:13:34.570
Baaulp and Gir: Holy shit.

1:13:34.570,1:13:40.489
Wayne: I have a very clear memory of like,
uh, having a dream when I was a little kid

1:13:40.489,1:13:44.719
where I was at like, Sea World, watching like
Shamu or whatever the fuck, and like a big

1:13:44.719,1:13:49.219
stadium with a pool in the center, and I remember
something started freaking me out so bad I

1:13:49.219,1:13:53.489
was like, and mind you, I was in like the
middle of the bleachers like-like hundreds

1:13:53.489,1:13:57.730
of feet away from the pool in the center,
I remember standing up and vertically leaping

1:13:57.730,1:14:00.730
into the center of the stage and into the
water and dying and waking up.

1:14:00.730,1:14:01.730
I remember that like [laughs]—

1:14:01.730,1:14:02.730
[Trog laughs]

1:14:02.730,1:14:03.730
Gir: That’s incredible.

1:14:03.730,1:14:04.750
Wayne, laughing: And I was like-and I was
like seven!

1:14:04.750,1:14:06.880
Trog: Death on contact with the water.

1:14:06.880,1:14:11.640
Log: You do it so cinematic, like, I could
just-if I know I’m in a dream I can just

1:14:11.640,1:14:12.730
force myself awake.

1:14:12.730,1:14:14.060
Trog: I can’t do that.

1:14:14.060,1:14:15.239
I don’t know why.

1:14:15.239,1:14:16.360
Wayne: Nowadays I can, but…

1:14:16.360,1:14:20.800
Baaulp: Yeah, that’s the-the thing with
Trog said, that is absolutely crazy to me,

1:14:20.800,1:14:22.500
because I’ve never felt pain in a dream.

1:14:22.500,1:14:23.830
I’ve never felt pain in a dream, because—

1:14:23.830,1:14:25.030
Wayne: Not that I can remember.

1:14:25.030,1:14:30.380
Baaulp: Yeah, one of two things-one of two
things will happen, either like—I am astronomically

1:14:30.380,1:14:36.000
clumsier in my dreams than I am waking up,
like, for some reason in my dreams—‘Cause

1:14:36.000,1:14:41.440
it’s weird, I’m not as clumsy in real
life, but in my dreams I always drop things

1:14:41.440,1:14:45.239
and like, I always trip, and those usually
will jolt me awake, right?

1:14:45.239,1:14:46.300
Log: Yeah, that’s normal.

1:14:46.300,1:14:51.160
Baaulp: That’ll usually jolt me awake, and
the same thing like, if I would ever be hurt,

1:14:51.160,1:14:55.370
I would usually just get jolted awake, and
I wouldn’t feel the pain, like that’s

1:14:55.370,1:14:57.920
crazy that you woke up and your hand hurt,
like, that’s crazy.

1:14:57.920,1:15:00.210
Trog: Yeah, I mean it’s the kind of thing,
right?

1:15:00.210,1:15:04.890
That it’s like, it just hurts while it hurts
and then it goes away ‘cause I don’t actually

1:15:04.890,1:15:06.350
have an injury, so it’s not like—

1:15:06.350,1:15:07.350
Gir: Yeah.

1:15:07.350,1:15:12.110
Trog: But it’s just like, yeah, I just-I
vividly recall earlier today taking a nap,

1:15:12.110,1:15:16.219
sticking my hand into a plant, and having
it physically hurt me.

1:15:16.219,1:15:21.580
Baaulp: And I-I’ve had dreams where I’ve
been injured before, but like—And I will

1:15:21.580,1:15:25.820
panic, like, y’know, I don’t know, I can’t
remember the last time I was like hurt in

1:15:25.820,1:15:29.761
a dream but like, I don’t know, maybe I
broke my arm or something in a dream, and

1:15:29.761,1:15:35.090
like, I’ll freak out, but when I wake up
I’m like, “Oh, I had a dream about breaking

1:15:35.090,1:15:40.140
my arm, good thing I didn’t actually feel-I
didn’t feel any pain!”

1:15:40.140,1:15:41.140
Like y’know.

1:15:41.140,1:15:45.580
Gir: The two things that come to mind is usually
if I have like a headache while I’m asleep,

1:15:45.580,1:15:46.860
I can feel the headache in the dream—

1:15:46.860,1:15:48.290
Baaulp: Oh well, yeah, that’s ‘cause that’s-you
have a headache, yeah.

1:15:48.290,1:15:51.030
Gir: Which is, that’s like the easiest example,
yeah.

1:15:51.030,1:15:52.030
Trog: That makes sense.

1:15:52.030,1:15:57.659
Gir: But I do remember, this was years and
years and years ago, having a dream where

1:15:57.659,1:16:04.790
some kind of snake bit me, and whatever it
did, whatever the venom did, it kept me from

1:16:04.790,1:16:08.940
being able to breathe properly and I couldn’t
speak, so I couldn’t tell anybody that I

1:16:08.940,1:16:11.190
got bit by a snake, so I couldn’t get any
help.

1:16:11.190,1:16:12.350
Trog: That’s a terrible nightmare.

1:16:12.350,1:16:15.890
Gir: And that was probably the worst-that
was probably the worst nightmare I’d—That’s

1:16:15.890,1:16:18.940
probably the last nightmare I really had,
actually.

1:16:18.940,1:16:21.909
And that was probably ten, eleven, twelve
years ago.

1:16:21.909,1:16:25.340
Trog: It’s funny that you mention getting
bit by a snake because a reoccurring theme

1:16:25.340,1:16:30.790
in my-in my anxiety stress dreams is there’s
always an animal trying to bite me, and I

1:16:30.790,1:16:33.820
have to like, hold its mouth open with my
bare hands.

1:16:33.820,1:16:34.910
[Gir and Wayne laugh]

1:16:34.910,1:16:37.600
Trog: This is a reoccurring theme in my dreams,
I don’t know why.

1:16:37.600,1:16:39.180
Gir: You ever been bitten by an animal?

1:16:39.180,1:16:40.180
Trog: No!

1:16:40.180,1:16:44.830
I’ve never gotten like, seriously injured
by an animal ever in my life, I love animals.

1:16:44.830,1:16:45.830
[Gir laughs]

1:16:45.830,1:16:47.810
Baaulp: You’re like fuckin’ Tarzan in
your dreams!

1:16:47.810,1:16:48.810
All the time!

1:16:48.810,1:16:51.430
Trog: Yeah, but it’s not like I’m cool
like Tarzan, it’s like, “Fuck, I have

1:16:51.430,1:16:57.159
to stop this giant snake from biting me on
my arm by like, holding its jaws open with

1:16:57.159,1:16:58.159
my fists.”

1:16:58.159,1:17:00.080
Baaulp: “I gotta pick these acid plants!”

1:17:00.080,1:17:05.840
Gir: But one more aside on the topic of dreams,
is uh, and I finally got a real confirmation

1:17:05.840,1:17:09.960
of this the other night, was y’know how
people say, “Oh, you can’t read in dreams,”

1:17:09.960,1:17:11.750
and people will be like, “Oh, bullshit,
yeah you can!”

1:17:11.750,1:17:15.140
I can confirm I read a street sign in my dream
like two days ago.

1:17:15.140,1:17:16.140
Trog: Yeah.

1:17:16.140,1:17:20.200
Wayne: Yeah, sometimes I can read, like, I
almost feel like you can read in a dream if

1:17:20.200,1:17:24.520
the dream like, intends for you to derive
something from that reading.

1:17:24.520,1:17:25.520
Gir: Yeah.

1:17:25.520,1:17:29.750
Wayne: Like-like I’ve had dreams where I
get like a letter and I have to read the letter

1:17:29.750,1:17:35.790
like, to understand—Well, understand, quote
unquote, the dream plot, but like, I think

1:17:35.790,1:17:39.590
if I realized I was in a dream and I tried
to just read anything, that’s where like

1:17:39.590,1:17:40.750
the simulation falls apart.

1:17:40.750,1:17:44.480
Trog: I think the thing with reading in dreams
is that, it’s not that it’s impossible

1:17:44.480,1:17:50.810
to read in dreams, it’s just that sometimes
it is impossible to read in dreams, and that’s

1:17:50.810,1:17:56.170
why it’s used as like, a lucid dream trigger,
is that if you can-if you can tell that you

1:17:56.170,1:17:57.740
can’t read then it helps.

1:17:57.740,1:18:02.020
But also, I think it’s the fact that recognizing
that sometimes you can read in dreams, but

1:18:02.020,1:18:06.659
what you’re reading doesn’t make any sense
at all, whenever you think about it.

1:18:06.659,1:18:08.180
I think that’s also part of it.

1:18:08.180,1:18:12.520
Wayne: For me I can never-I can never like
intentionally trip of force a lucid dream

1:18:12.520,1:18:16.420
out of a regular dream, for me it’s always
like, I always like fall asleep weird and

1:18:16.420,1:18:17.980
like, enter a lucid dream immediately.

1:18:17.980,1:18:18.980
Trog: Yeah.

1:18:18.980,1:18:22.199
Wayne: Like-like I know that I’m doing it,
like it’s not intentional, either, it just

1:18:22.199,1:18:23.199
happens.

1:18:23.199,1:18:24.199
Trog: Mhmm.

1:18:24.199,1:18:28.139
Wayne: Next question comes from Turkey Samich,
and they say, “If you could have any car

1:18:28.139,1:18:32.420
(including movie cars, rare one-of-one cars,
etc.) what would you pick?”

1:18:32.420,1:18:35.620
Lightning McQueen, I’d dissect him for billions
of dollars.

1:18:35.620,1:18:38.199
Trog: What do you think’s inside of Lightning
McQueen?

1:18:38.199,1:18:39.949
Like is it just a normal car in there?

1:18:39.949,1:18:42.830
Wayne: That’s what I’m saying, I would-you
would be rich.

1:18:42.830,1:18:44.550
Gir: Blood, guts, and poop.

1:18:44.550,1:18:48.610
Wayne: I-I think you would be rich if you
could get Lightning McQueen and figure out

1:18:48.610,1:18:52.430
what the fuck’s going on there and uh, I
mean you wouldn’t have to care ‘cause

1:18:52.430,1:18:54.750
he’s not human, either, he has no soul,
he’s a car.

1:18:54.750,1:18:55.750
Trog: Oh, okay.

1:18:55.750,1:18:56.750
Gir: He has no rights.

1:18:56.750,1:18:57.750
Baaulp: Ehh.

1:18:57.750,1:18:58.750
Wayne, laughing: He has no rights!

1:18:58.750,1:19:01.520
Trog: So, Wayne doesn’t care about the sentience
of a creature, simply that they have a human

1:19:01.520,1:19:02.520
soul.

1:19:02.520,1:19:08.460
Wayne: [Laughs] Listen, I’m just trying
to pick the optimi-the optimized answer.

1:19:08.460,1:19:09.460
Trog: Uh-huh.

1:19:09.460,1:19:10.460
Wayne: I don’t [laughs]—

1:19:10.460,1:19:12.210
Trog: You’re trying to get the high score
on this podcast question.

1:19:12.210,1:19:13.210
Wayne: Yeah.

1:19:13.210,1:19:14.900
Gir: Just want to find out why he sounds like
Owen Wilson.

1:19:14.900,1:19:17.930
Wayne: No, other than that joke, I don’t
even know if we should-like, do you guys have

1:19:17.930,1:19:19.330
an answer to the car question?

1:19:19.330,1:19:20.330
Baaulp: Uh, Mater.

1:19:20.330,1:19:21.400
So I can dissect him.

1:19:21.400,1:19:22.400
[Wayne laughs]

1:19:22.400,1:19:23.400
Trog: No, you can’t do that.

1:19:23.400,1:19:24.400
Wayne: Mater.

1:19:24.400,1:19:25.400
Trog: It depends.

1:19:25.400,1:19:28.090
Can I like, pick a car with like, special
properties or does it—

1:19:28.090,1:19:30.200
Log: Let’s just dissect every Disney car.

1:19:30.200,1:19:33.820
Wayne: Do you guys know any Cars characters
other than Lightning McQueen and Mater?

1:19:33.820,1:19:34.820
‘Cause I don’t.

1:19:34.820,1:19:35.820
Trog: Um, no, not really.

1:19:35.820,1:19:37.860
Baaulp: That blue Maserati that Lightning
McQueen wants to fuck.

1:19:37.860,1:19:39.040
Wayne: What’s her name?

1:19:39.040,1:19:40.210
Baaulp: I don’t know.

1:19:40.210,1:19:41.210
Trog: Yeah, exactly.

1:19:41.210,1:19:43.500
Log: There’s like a little fucker named
Luigi.

1:19:43.500,1:19:45.830
Trog: I feel like I remember—There’s a
big truck, right?

1:19:45.830,1:19:46.830
Wayne: Bro, that’s Mario.

1:19:46.830,1:19:47.830
Trog: There’s like a—

1:19:47.830,1:19:50.860
Wayne: You’re thinking of Super Mario Bros,
I know that Lightning McQueen is red—

1:19:50.860,1:19:52.469
Log: He’s like the-he’s like the little
forklift.

1:19:52.469,1:19:53.469
Wayne: It’s different.

1:19:53.469,1:19:54.660
Trog: Yeah, I remember that.

1:19:54.660,1:19:56.600
Wayne: What’s the little red car?

1:19:56.600,1:19:57.600
That goes kachow?

1:19:57.600,1:19:58.639
Oh yeah, Elmo.

1:19:58.639,1:20:00.050
Gir: From Super Mario Brothers?

1:20:00.050,1:20:01.050
[Wayne laughs]

1:20:01.050,1:20:05.239
Trog: I’d pick a clown car that I can fit
a hundred people in, but it’s really tiny.

1:20:05.239,1:20:10.100
Wayne: Funniest thing in the world, in the
history of me knowing my friends and us being

1:20:10.100,1:20:14.520
a group, is Baaulp accidentally calling Elmo
‘Mario’ in full honesty.

1:20:14.520,1:20:15.520
[Everyone laughs]

1:20:15.520,1:20:16.940
Baaulp: Listen, it’s red!

1:20:16.940,1:20:18.150
Trog: It’s red.

1:20:18.150,1:20:19.770
Baaulp: Yeah, it’s red.

1:20:19.770,1:20:21.380
I’m like a bull.

1:20:21.380,1:20:23.449
Trog: You’re right, Mario is red.

1:20:23.449,1:20:24.449
And Elmo’s Italian.

1:20:24.449,1:20:26.980
Gir: Yeah, he’s red, just like Goofy from
McDonalds.

1:20:26.980,1:20:30.850
Wayne: It’s like little Mega64 ArmorGames
video, “Is the red one Mario?”

1:20:30.850,1:20:32.760
Gir: I have no answer to the car question.

1:20:32.760,1:20:35.739
Wayne: Yeah, other than that stupid joke I
made I don’t have one, either.

1:20:35.739,1:20:39.730
Trog: I told you, I want a clown car that
works like clown cars do in cartoons.

1:20:39.730,1:20:42.090
Gir: I want the flying car from GTA Online.

1:20:42.090,1:20:44.610
Wayne: I wan the car from the Flintstones!

1:20:44.610,1:20:47.940
Trog: That one would suck, you’d have to
wheel it yourself!

1:20:47.940,1:20:48.940
Gir: Yeah.

1:20:48.940,1:20:50.360
Wayne: Yeah, but it’d be funny.

1:20:50.360,1:20:51.650
Trog: I mean, yes.

1:20:51.650,1:20:54.290
Also, I don’t think that car can turn.

1:20:54.290,1:20:55.290
[Wayne laughs]

1:20:55.290,1:20:59.199
Trog: Whenever you think about the logistics
of how that car is manufactured.

1:20:59.199,1:21:00.250
Gir: Y’know what?

1:21:00.250,1:21:03.980
For a real car, I-I actually would like a
DeLorean.

1:21:03.980,1:21:06.410
Like a real DeLorean, not the fucking Back
to the Future one.

1:21:06.410,1:21:07.410
Trog: Yeah.

1:21:07.410,1:21:08.410
That’d be cool.

1:21:08.410,1:21:09.410
I mean, they’re nice cars.

1:21:09.410,1:21:13.170
I don’t know, the thing is is that I’m
like, I’m not like a car person, and even

1:21:13.170,1:21:16.060
less than that I barely drive, so like, I
don’t know—

1:21:16.060,1:21:19.060
Wayne: I only brought the question up because
that answer popped into my head like instantly,

1:21:19.060,1:21:21.120
it was just dissect Lightning McQueen.

1:21:21.120,1:21:24.390
Baaulp: And you had to get it out.

1:21:24.390,1:21:25.390
Wayne: Yes.

1:21:25.390,1:21:32.040
Baaulp: Poltermice asks, “If you had the
option to create a convention for a game/concept,

1:21:32.040,1:21:36.500
without having to worry about money, time,
or manpower, what would you center it around

1:21:36.500,1:21:39.090
and where would—and what would be there?”

1:21:39.090,1:21:45.750
So basically, if you could will just magically,
any kind of convention for anything, what

1:21:45.750,1:21:46.750
would you do?

1:21:46.750,1:21:47.750
Trog: Hmm.

1:21:47.750,1:21:48.750
Baaulp: And that comes from Poltermice, thank
you very much.

1:21:48.750,1:21:52.960
Gir: I think the conventions for the things
I’m interested al-already exist.

1:21:52.960,1:21:58.110
Baaulp: Well, no, you’re thinking-you’re
thinking too low-level, I would have—

1:21:58.110,1:21:59.110
Wayne: PeppersCon!

1:21:59.110,1:22:01.680
Baaulp: Yes, like-yeah, like we could have
Pepperscon [laughs]!

1:22:01.680,1:22:02.680
Wayne: BalloonBlastCon!

1:22:02.680,1:22:05.050
Baaulp: Yeah, like we could have BalloonBoyCon,
like!

1:22:05.050,1:22:06.730
Gir: Balloon Boy Con [laughs]?

1:22:06.730,1:22:08.070
Baaulp: Yeah, exactly [laughs]!

1:22:08.070,1:22:16.949
Trog: I want a convention that is a convention
for people who are very rich and very generous,

1:22:16.949,1:22:18.159
and I will walk around and ask for money.

1:22:18.159,1:22:22.449
Gir: I was just about to say—The Give MasterGir
Money Convention.

1:22:22.449,1:22:23.449
[Wayne laughs]

1:22:23.449,1:22:24.449
Trog: Yeah.

1:22:24.449,1:22:25.449
[Baaulp laughs]

1:22:25.449,1:22:30.290
Trog: It’s for philanthropists, but it’s
for philanthropists who just like handing

1:22:30.290,1:22:31.290
me hundred-dollar bills.

1:22:31.290,1:22:32.290
Baaulp: For just you!

1:22:32.290,1:22:34.920
Gir: Nah, I’m gonna say I want the Bird
Box Convention.

1:22:34.920,1:22:35.920
Baaulp What is that?

1:22:35.920,1:22:36.920
Trog: Bird Box?

1:22:36.920,1:22:38.960
Gir: I want a convention of people that are
walking around with blindfolds on.

1:22:38.960,1:22:40.239
Baaulp: Ohhh, like that.

1:22:40.239,1:22:41.239
[Trog laughs]

1:22:41.239,1:22:43.630
Baaulp: Like Comic-Con but everyone’s blindfolded!

1:22:43.630,1:22:45.690
Gir, laughing: Yeah, everyone’s blindfolded!

1:22:45.690,1:22:50.730
Wayne: You’re gonna get ten concussions
on day one and uh, then you’ll be banned

1:22:50.730,1:22:51.730
from the venue.

1:22:51.730,1:22:55.730
Gir: No, they have to sign a waver before
entering that says that I’m allowed to let

1:22:55.730,1:22:57.090
them do that and laugh at it.

1:22:57.090,1:22:58.210
Wayne: No one will come.

1:22:58.210,1:23:01.890
Gir: No, it’s my convention and I say everybody
comes!

1:23:01.890,1:23:03.790
Wayne: [Laughs] In your fantasy world.

1:23:03.790,1:23:06.489
Gir: In my fantasy world everyone comes!

1:23:06.489,1:23:10.530
Wayne: Well, unlike you, everyone would come
to PeppersCon even if it wasn’t a fantasy

1:23:10.530,1:23:11.530
world, so, I’m like—

1:23:11.530,1:23:13.100
Gir: What if you’re allergic to peppers?

1:23:13.100,1:23:14.739
Wayne: I mean, they don’t have to come.

1:23:14.739,1:23:16.380
Baaulp: Syn-syn-synthetic peppers.

1:23:16.380,1:23:18.120
Wayne: Most people would go.

1:23:18.120,1:23:19.690
Baaulp: Syn-synthetic peppers [laughs].

1:23:19.690,1:23:22.110
Gir: Check out our new syn-peppers!

1:23:22.110,1:23:25.900
Wayne: We got hypoallergenic peppers!

1:23:25.900,1:23:32.380
Trog: I want a convention that’s like-I
want a convention that’s like uh, well what’s

1:23:32.380,1:23:33.980
the one, it’s CES, right?

1:23:33.980,1:23:34.980
That’s like the big tech—

1:23:34.980,1:23:37.199
Baaulp: Yeah, that’s more geared towards
general electronics, yeah.

1:23:37.199,1:23:41.949
Trog: Yeah, I want a convention that’s like
CES but the shit actually looks like it’s

1:23:41.949,1:23:45.480
from the future and it’s not just your juicer
connects to your Wi-Fi.

1:23:45.480,1:23:46.480
Wayne: Bullshit.

1:23:46.480,1:23:50.850
Gir: I was going to make a crude like, “Oh
haha sex toy convention,” joke, and I remembered

1:23:50.850,1:23:51.850
that’s just a thing.

1:23:51.850,1:23:52.850
Trog: I mean, yeah, that’s—

1:23:52.850,1:23:53.850
Wayne: Yeah, they do that.

1:23:53.850,1:23:54.850
Gir: That’s like several things.

1:23:54.850,1:23:55.850
Baaulp: They have those—

1:23:55.850,1:24:00.560
Trog: Imagine a CES where you go and all the
shit there actually looks useful and cool.

1:24:00.560,1:24:02.699
Baaulp: It’s like actual things from the
future!

1:24:02.699,1:24:05.960
Yeah, that’d be dope.

1:24:05.960,1:24:07.590
Real answer?

1:24:07.590,1:24:17.280
Like-like, okay, serious answer, a fighting
game like—So Magic the Gathering, I-I think

1:24:17.280,1:24:21.960
this ran for a while, I’m not sure, I haven’t
paid attention to like the competitive Magic

1:24:21.960,1:24:26.640
the Gathering scene, but since the Magic the
Gathering player base tends to be like older

1:24:26.640,1:24:30.639
people, it doesn’t-it’s not like typical
gamer things.

1:24:30.639,1:24:37.139
One of the coolest things that they would
have is the Magic the Gathering cruise, and

1:24:37.139,1:24:41.190
what it would be is, yeah, you just go on
a three-day cruise and everyone there plays

1:24:41.190,1:24:42.190
the same game.

1:24:42.190,1:24:43.590
Like everyone there plays Magic the Gathering.

1:24:43.590,1:24:49.920
And the other thing that was cool was like,
that was their convention and also like, people

1:24:49.920,1:24:56.199
would like-have like—There’d be like serious
panels on like, “Yeah, here’s how to get

1:24:56.199,1:24:59.870
really good at this game, like here’s what
you do, here’s how you like do this and

1:24:59.870,1:25:02.340
do that,” like I want that but for fighting
games.

1:25:02.340,1:25:06.739
Like, it’s not a tournament, it’s like
here’s an event where you show up if you’re

1:25:06.739,1:25:12.920
a fan of fighting games and you just play
all week and there’s just like serious discussion

1:25:12.920,1:25:18.020
about like, the state of things and like,
how to get better, ‘cause I feel like right

1:25:18.020,1:25:22.350
now every like, “Oh, how to get good at
this fighting game,” is like to me it seems

1:25:22.350,1:25:27.360
very gimmicky, and it’s like, there’s
no one who’s like-there’s no one who is

1:25:27.360,1:25:32.429
just like old and like, “Yeah, I’ll-I’ll
teach you how to play without-and I’m not

1:25:32.429,1:25:38.239
sponsored by like, anything, I’m just-I’m
just here to teach you for real, like in a

1:25:38.239,1:25:40.250
super accurate and detailed way, this.”

1:25:40.250,1:25:45.380
‘Cause like, I’m a little older, I’m-I’m
like closer to thirty now, I care more about

1:25:45.380,1:25:48.470
those things than I used to when I was like,
younger.

1:25:48.470,1:25:49.860
I think it’d be interesting.

1:25:49.860,1:25:50.860
Gir: Hey, Baaulp?

1:25:50.860,1:25:51.909
Two things.

1:25:51.909,1:25:56.510
One, I am very surprised your convention had
nothing to do with food.

1:25:56.510,1:25:57.510
Baaulp: What?

1:25:57.510,1:25:58.510
Trog: Yeah.

1:25:58.510,1:25:59.510
A little bit.

1:25:59.510,1:26:00.510
Gir: And two—

1:26:00.510,1:26:01.510
Wayne: DinnerCon!

1:26:01.510,1:26:08.469
Gir: Two, my real, real, final answer, uh,
I have to take a personality test and list

1:26:08.469,1:26:13.340
my favorite things in the world that I like,
and then everybody that wants to come to my

1:26:13.340,1:26:15.730
convention has to match that personality test.

1:26:15.730,1:26:16.730
Wayne: Self-centered?

1:26:16.730,1:26:17.730
Much?

1:26:17.730,1:26:20.540
Trog: So peppers and burying toys.

1:26:20.540,1:26:22.790
Wayne: Peppers and Dragon Ball Z and—

1:26:22.790,1:26:24.830
Gir: It’s the Stuff I Like Con.

1:26:24.830,1:26:25.830
Wayne: Robots.

1:26:25.830,1:26:27.650
Log: And not being wet in a car.

1:26:27.650,1:26:28.650
[Baaulp laughs]

1:26:28.650,1:26:30.410
Gir: That’s true, I don’t like being wet
in a car.

1:26:30.410,1:26:33.840
Log: What kind of personality test do you
take that tells you what you like?

1:26:33.840,1:26:34.840
That seems very specific.

1:26:34.840,1:26:37.390
Wayne: Yeah, I don’t know what the fuck
you’re talking about [laughs].

1:26:37.390,1:26:38.390
Trog: Yeah, that’s like—

1:26:38.390,1:26:41.710
Gir: No, I’m not-I say you do the personality
test and at the end you list the things that

1:26:41.710,1:26:42.790
you like on top of it.

1:26:42.790,1:26:46.360
Wayne: Yo Baaulp, if DinnerCon has any peppers
I’m fucking suing you.

1:26:46.360,1:26:47.360
[Baaulp laughs]

1:26:47.360,1:26:49.560
Log: Anyways, I want a french fry convention.

1:26:49.560,1:26:50.560
Baaulp: Oohhhh.

1:26:50.560,1:26:51.560
Wayne: Yeah!

1:26:51.560,1:26:53.090
Gir: I guarantee that’s real.

1:26:53.090,1:26:59.110
Log: The kind of stuff that I like and am
like, invested in, having a con-like I-I don’t

1:26:59.110,1:27:04.150
think I would want a convention just about
that, I feel like I would get exhausted, but

1:27:04.150,1:27:07.820
a french fry convention I could go there and
have all kinds of french fries.

1:27:07.820,1:27:08.820
Trog: True.

1:27:08.820,1:27:09.820
Gir: I would go with you.

1:27:09.820,1:27:11.300
I would absolutely go with you.

1:27:11.300,1:27:13.020
Wayne: It’d be great!

1:27:13.020,1:27:14.800
And there’s-and there are so many kinds
of fries.

1:27:14.800,1:27:17.840
There are so many things that you can do with
french fries that I think like, it’d be

1:27:17.840,1:27:20.770
a smaller scale convention, but you could
do it and it’d be awesome.

1:27:20.770,1:27:25.070
Like, you can get-you can get truffle fries,
you can get like fucking vinegar fries, you

1:27:25.070,1:27:28.350
can get fuckin’ poutine, you can get fuckin’
cheese fries—

1:27:28.350,1:27:29.590
Baaulp: It’s called poutine.

1:27:29.590,1:27:33.380
Gir: No, I want to go to the french fry convention
sponsored by Dr. Pepper.

1:27:33.380,1:27:34.380
[Trog laughs]

1:27:34.380,1:27:38.190
Wayne: And they would like-people would build
things out of french fries!

1:27:38.190,1:27:39.260
It would be crazy!

1:27:39.260,1:27:44.210
Log: There’s all kinds of crazy french fries
out there, there’s like-there’s like Tex-Mex

1:27:44.210,1:27:46.130
french fries, like carne asada fries—

1:27:46.130,1:27:47.130
Wayne: Oooh.

1:27:47.130,1:27:54.690
Log: There’s a place that I saw that served
uh, like tikka masala fries, like-just like

1:27:54.690,1:27:57.960
french fries with Indian curry ingredients.

1:27:57.960,1:27:58.960
That sounds crazy.

1:27:58.960,1:28:01.850
Gir: Have you ever had french fries with uh,
tzatziki?

1:28:01.850,1:28:03.170
Log: Nope.

1:28:03.170,1:28:05.070
Baaulp: Uh, probably at some point.

1:28:05.070,1:28:08.219
Gir: Pot-I mean it’s potatoes, so it goes
with fucking everything, that’s the thing,

1:28:08.219,1:28:10.179
that’s why fries are so good!

1:28:10.179,1:28:11.929
Log: But yeah, French Fry Convention.

1:28:11.929,1:28:14.760
Baaulp: You didn’t let me get my joke answer
out.

1:28:14.760,1:28:15.820
That was my serious answer.

1:28:15.820,1:28:21.989
I just want like, a serious like-not tournament,
like a fighting game convention of like, where

1:28:21.989,1:28:23.030
like, like-minded—Y’know.

1:28:23.030,1:28:25.960
Here’s—Let’s help each other get good.

1:28:25.960,1:28:27.520
We want to get good, right?

1:28:27.520,1:28:28.520
Let’s help each other get good.

1:28:28.520,1:28:34.300
My joke answer, though this still kind of
would be dope, uh, it kind of builds on Log’s

1:28:34.300,1:28:36.280
answer a little, FairCon.

1:28:36.280,1:28:37.810
Gir: A fair convention?

1:28:37.810,1:28:38.949
Baaulp: Yes, yes!

1:28:38.949,1:28:40.400
Here’s what it would be.

1:28:40.400,1:28:41.590
The real fair?

1:28:41.590,1:28:42.590
It sucks.

1:28:42.590,1:28:47.830
You go there for overpriced fair food and
like, there’s rip-offs at every turn, and

1:28:47.830,1:28:52.219
then there’s like-there’s like uh, a sprint
booth, where they try to sign you up for a

1:28:52.219,1:28:54.210
sprint thing, right?

1:28:54.210,1:28:55.610
Gir: Mhmm.

1:28:55.610,1:29:01.810
Baaulp: FairCon would be a con for people
who like going to the fair, and it would have

1:29:01.810,1:29:05.160
the amenities of a fair, but it’d be real.

1:29:05.160,1:29:10.460
It would just be rip-offs, so it’d be-it
would be—I’m imagining like, the show

1:29:10.460,1:29:16.560
floor would be like, the show floor would
be like, “Oh, yeah, check out all the fair

1:29:16.560,1:29:18.690
food, but at reasonable prices!”

1:29:18.690,1:29:23.100
And it’s like the best of, of all the fairs,
we’ve got the “best of” food of all

1:29:23.100,1:29:24.100
the fairs, like—

1:29:24.100,1:29:29.150
Gir: Baaulp, you’re just-you’re just describing
a fair, but with a lot of good rides and good

1:29:29.150,1:29:30.150
prices.

1:29:30.150,1:29:32.210
You want a fair that’s not ripping you off
[laughs].

1:29:32.210,1:29:34.290
Baaulp: No, no, there wouldn’t be rides.

1:29:34.290,1:29:36.830
There wouldn’t be rides, instead there’d
be panels about rides.

1:29:36.830,1:29:37.830
Gir: Well then—What?

1:29:37.830,1:29:38.840
That sounds like shit!

1:29:38.840,1:29:44.130
Trog: You would want to go to a room and listen
to people talk about a fair ride?

1:29:44.130,1:29:45.170
Gir: That sounds like shit!

1:29:45.170,1:29:46.170
Baaulp: Yeah!

1:29:46.170,1:29:49.460
Yeah, I-Yeah, I’d go to the, “I’ve seen
the world’s fattest pig,” panel, and when

1:29:49.460,1:29:50.460
they-when they were like—

1:29:50.460,1:29:51.460
Gir: That sounds awful!

1:29:51.460,1:29:55.540
Baaulp: Where they show you the world’s
fattest pig and you don’t have to pay the

1:29:55.540,1:29:59.420
dollar and they’re like, “Yeah, here it
is.

1:29:59.420,1:30:01.330
This is what they don’t want you to see.”

1:30:01.330,1:30:03.280
Gir: Now you’re describing a worse fair!

1:30:03.280,1:30:04.280
Baaulp: [Laughs] I think it’s good!

1:30:04.280,1:30:05.280
I think it’s good.

1:30:05.280,1:30:07.890
Gir: It’s a fair where you go to talk about,
“What if we were actually at the fair?

1:30:07.890,1:30:09.000
Wouldn’t that be great?”

1:30:09.000,1:30:10.010
Baaulp: I think it’s good.

1:30:10.010,1:30:12.110
Wayne: I can’t even-I can’t even hear
this.

1:30:12.110,1:30:14.140
French fry and pepper con, that’s all we
need.

1:30:14.140,1:30:15.869
Trog: I want a rhythm game convention.

1:30:15.869,1:30:17.500
Gir: Combine them!

1:30:17.500,1:30:19.160
French Fry and Pepper Con!

1:30:19.160,1:30:23.460
Wayne: We gotta stop—We’re getting into
dangerous territory, there will be consequences.

1:30:23.460,1:30:27.090
Baaulp: I still think my ideas would be a
good idea.

1:30:27.090,1:30:30.460
Trog: Um, yeah, I want a rhythm game convention,
that’s my answer.

1:30:30.460,1:30:31.500
But we should move on.

1:30:31.500,1:30:33.060
Wayne: That would actually be great, that
would be sick.

1:30:33.060,1:30:34.670
Gir: There’s no way that’s not real.

1:30:34.670,1:30:35.670
Trog: Not real right now, but.

1:30:35.670,1:30:36.670
Wayne: Not on a large scale.

1:30:36.670,1:30:39.590
Gir: No, not on a large scale, maybe, but
there’s probably like a local.

1:30:39.590,1:30:43.751
Trog: Yeah, it would be cool to have a rhythm
game convention that just has like, every

1:30:43.751,1:30:47.250
single good rhythm game playable, that’d
be fun.

1:30:47.250,1:30:51.130
Gir: That wouldn’t happen outside of America-I
mean outside of Japan, rather.

1:30:51.130,1:30:52.230
Trog: Yeah, exactly.

1:30:52.230,1:30:54.080
Um, I have another question.

1:30:54.080,1:30:57.840
Talking about fairs, this actually leads into
another question that I really like.

1:30:57.840,1:31:03.140
This is a question from TyeFyeDye, who says,
“If you had to design a Radio TV Solutions

1:31:03.140,1:31:08.340
themed amusement park, what rides would you
use to represent each member?”

1:31:08.340,1:31:10.260
I really like this question.

1:31:10.260,1:31:13.230
Wayne: This was one of the ones I was going
to go to, as well.

1:31:13.230,1:31:16.690
Um, but it’s tough, is the thing.

1:31:16.690,1:31:18.250
This is going to take some thinking.

1:31:18.250,1:31:19.610
Trog: Now, here’s the question.

1:31:19.610,1:31:25.480
Should we each design our own ride, or should
we each have to pick somebody else?

1:31:25.480,1:31:28.440
Baaulp: Yes, because I have such a good idea—Ohh,
that would be good, too.

1:31:28.440,1:31:30.040
Gir: I have a good idea for my ride.

1:31:30.040,1:31:31.850
Baaulp: How about one and one.

1:31:31.850,1:31:35.660
Design your own ride and then pick someone
else in the group to design a ride for.

1:31:35.660,1:31:36.660
Does that sound good?

1:31:36.660,1:31:37.810
Gir: I don’t have the brainpower for that.

1:31:37.810,1:31:38.810
Baaulp: I do.

1:31:38.810,1:31:39.810
Trog: I could do it.

1:31:39.810,1:31:40.810
But—

1:31:40.810,1:31:41.810
Baaulp: I’ll go first, fuck it!

1:31:41.810,1:31:48.020
My ride would be uh, it’s a small culinary
world.

1:31:48.020,1:31:56.540
It’d be a slow ride, basically we would
build an entire buffet restaurant, and the-the

1:31:56.540,1:32:04.110
slow ride goes through it, and the gimmick
is all the food is real and so you are able-the

1:32:04.110,1:32:09.920
ride goes slow enough that you are actively
encouraged to pick up plates of food and bring

1:32:09.920,1:32:12.360
them with you like out of the ride [laughs].

1:32:12.360,1:32:13.360
[Trog laughs]

1:32:13.360,1:32:16.580
Gir: You’re-you’re describing like the
inverse of those sushi bars with the rotating-the

1:32:16.580,1:32:17.580
rotating bar.

1:32:17.580,1:32:18.580
Trog: Yeah.

1:32:18.580,1:32:20.320
Gir: You’re moving and the food stays there.

1:32:20.320,1:32:25.250
Baaulp: And just like It’s a Small World,
it covers all the foods of the world, so you

1:32:25.250,1:32:26.560
start off maybe in North America—

1:32:26.560,1:32:27.560
Gir: Okay.

1:32:27.560,1:32:28.560
I’d ride that!

1:32:28.560,1:32:31.890
Baaulp: —and you’re like, “Oh, get some
brisket, we’re in Texas, get some brisket!”

1:32:31.890,1:32:35.610
And then, y’know, you eat your brisket and
then the next thing you know you’re in-you’re

1:32:35.610,1:32:39.020
in, y’know, you’re in uh, you’re in
China and it’s like—

1:32:39.020,1:32:42.080
Gir: Oh, we’re in Scotland, don’t touch
the fuckin’ haggis.

1:32:42.080,1:32:45.570
Baaulp: Yeah, yeah, yeah, and it’s-yeah,
and the gimmick is that all the food, it’s

1:32:45.570,1:32:49.050
not just a ride, all the food’s real, and
you’re actively like, you can’t get up,

1:32:49.050,1:32:52.030
but everything’s really low, so you’re
like encouraged to pick up plates of food

1:32:52.030,1:32:53.323
and eat it as you go [laughs].

1:32:53.323,1:32:57.790
Trog: It sounds like a health disaster, but
I do like the idea.

1:32:57.790,1:33:00.450
Gir: I’d be one of the first for the day.

1:33:00.450,1:33:06.250
Wayne: My ride would be-would take inspiration
off of one of my favorite amusement park rides,

1:33:06.250,1:33:13.340
uh, that I’ve ever—In regards to something
extra, it is one of my favorite amusement

1:33:13.340,1:33:15.000
park rides that I’ve ever been on.

1:33:15.000,1:33:17.600
So you ever-you ever been on those white water
rapids rides?

1:33:17.600,1:33:21.889
Not like the log flume, but it’s like-it’s
like a water ride where you go down a large

1:33:21.889,1:33:25.980
trail and you’re in like a big, circular
raft where you like look at each other and

1:33:25.980,1:33:29.760
like, you-you basically play the game of like,
“Okay, who’s gonna get the most wet,”

1:33:29.760,1:33:33.730
‘cause it’s kind of random, like you spin
and like you hit waves at certain points,

1:33:33.730,1:33:35.090
that shit’s fun.

1:33:35.090,1:33:39.520
But specifically, at the amusement park that
we would go to every year whenever we go up

1:33:39.520,1:33:46.460
to visit my grandma, um, the uh, they had
one of those rides, and along the ride, like

1:33:46.460,1:33:51.010
the ride would go along like the various walkways
in the park, and at various points there would

1:33:51.010,1:33:55.170
be a machine that you could put quarters into
and it was like a high pressure water gun

1:33:55.170,1:33:56.170
that you could blast people—

1:33:56.170,1:33:57.170
Gir: You can spray the people on the ride.

1:33:57.170,1:33:58.900
Wayne: Yeah, you spray the people on the ride.

1:33:58.900,1:34:03.550
So, my ride, would be like that, you’re
going through like a mountain and there’s

1:34:03.550,1:34:07.520
like, I guess there could be like Game Chimps
like, it’s like hot spring themed, so the

1:34:07.520,1:34:10.080
water’s hot and there could be like Game
Chimps all over it—

1:34:10.080,1:34:11.080
Gir: Oh!

1:34:11.080,1:34:12.080
Wayne: But the big twist?

1:34:12.080,1:34:13.119
The big twist?

1:34:13.119,1:34:17.420
Is that those guns not only can be operated
there, but they can be operated remotely,

1:34:17.420,1:34:22.670
and you could play the game, and we could
stream shooting at people with a water gun

1:34:22.670,1:34:23.929
on the ride, as they go—

1:34:23.929,1:34:24.929
[Trog laughs]

1:34:24.929,1:34:25.929
Gir: And they’re filled with bullets.

1:34:25.929,1:34:26.929
Trog: That’d be cool, yeah.

1:34:26.929,1:34:27.929
Wayne: No, no, not that.

1:34:27.929,1:34:28.929
[Gir laughs]

1:34:28.929,1:34:29.929
Log: Shooting hot water at people.

1:34:29.929,1:34:32.909
Trog: Yeah, I don’t know—I like that except
for the hot water, because all of my like,

1:34:32.909,1:34:38.550
mental images of theme parks are like, it’s
ninety degrees outside and my-and I’m miserable.

1:34:38.550,1:34:40.510
Gir: Yeah, you don’t really want a warm
water—

1:34:40.510,1:34:41.790
Trog: Right, right, yeah.

1:34:41.790,1:34:43.580
Wayne: It changes in the season, it changes
in the season.

1:34:43.580,1:34:46.290
Gir: Alright, warm water in the winter and
cold water in the summer, sure.

1:34:46.290,1:34:49.790
Wayne: Or maybe it’s hot like a hot tub
and then it gets cold at the end to cool you

1:34:49.790,1:34:50.790
off.

1:34:50.790,1:34:51.790
Gir: That would make you sick.

1:34:51.790,1:34:52.790
Trog: No.

1:34:52.790,1:34:53.790
Wayne: No.

1:34:53.790,1:34:54.790
Trog: It’d make you strong.

1:34:54.790,1:34:58.440
Gir: My ride would be fucking big, because
of the concept that I have.

1:34:58.440,1:35:01.690
Where y’know-y’know the thing where you
go in and you press against the wall and it

1:35:01.690,1:35:03.699
spins really fast so you’re pressed-the
gravity—

1:35:03.699,1:35:04.699
Baaulp: Uh-huh.

1:35:04.699,1:35:05.699
Trog: Mhmm.

1:35:05.699,1:35:10.440
Gir: Okay, imagine one big enough for just
two people, so it’s not super big, but it’s

1:35:10.440,1:35:12.460
big enough for two people, alright?

1:35:12.460,1:35:16.699
And it’s on a track, it’s on a moving
track, and then like, when whatever part of

1:35:16.699,1:35:22.139
the wall that you’re on isn’t-that you
aren’t—Whatever part of the wall that

1:35:22.139,1:35:25.670
you’re not on is a window so you can see
outside, right?

1:35:25.670,1:35:29.520
And it moves along this track and you have
like, a vision of like, it’s got some kind

1:35:29.520,1:35:32.659
of theme to it, I don’t care what the theme
is right now, but then it goes into a—

1:35:32.659,1:35:33.659
Trog: [Unintelligible]

1:35:33.659,1:35:36.219
Gir: …Sure, but then it goes into a dark
room, okay?

1:35:36.219,1:35:39.960
So you can’t see anything, and then I want
that ride, while you can’t see anything,

1:35:39.960,1:35:43.850
to start spinning so you’re pressed against
the wall, you can’t see shit, and then I

1:35:43.850,1:35:50.320
want it to be like uh, like uh, Space Odyssey-I
want it to just be like these bright lights

1:35:50.320,1:35:53.469
and these flashing lights while you’re spinning
really hard and you’re pressed against the

1:35:53.469,1:35:54.469
wall.

1:35:54.469,1:35:55.469
[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

1:35:55.469,1:35:56.469
Wayne: So you just want to give people seizures?

1:35:56.469,1:35:58.020
Gir: Well, you would have to sign a waiver.

1:35:58.020,1:35:59.020
Trog: You have to—Mhmm.

1:35:59.020,1:36:00.110
Gir: This is another thing where you have
to sign a waiver [laughs].

1:36:00.110,1:36:01.110
Trog: It’s a thrill ride!

1:36:01.110,1:36:02.110
It’s a thrill ride.

1:36:02.110,1:36:05.199
Wayne: Bro, your ideas seem to be like, they’re
damaging your fans.

1:36:05.199,1:36:06.570
Trog: Well, I like it.

1:36:06.570,1:36:08.699
Gir: Alright, so and then, y’know, you’re
pressed against the wall, the gravity’s

1:36:08.699,1:36:13.410
pulling you against the wall, you-the flashing
lights and colors, and then I want it to just

1:36:13.410,1:36:14.410
stop.

1:36:14.410,1:36:15.410
Wayne: So that’ll break people’s necks.

1:36:15.410,1:36:19.679
Trog: [Laughs] And then they just get flung
out of the ride and directly into the ambulance.

1:36:19.679,1:36:22.500
Wayne: If you stop and let the speed kill
normally—

1:36:22.500,1:36:25.989
Gir: I don’t mean literally like suddenly,
it’s just you hit the brakes.

1:36:25.989,1:36:26.989
Wayne: So you’re not engaging the brakes—

1:36:26.989,1:36:28.200
Gir: No, I’m not saying just hit the brakes.

1:36:28.200,1:36:31.310
Wayne: Okay, ‘cause that would act-absolutely
kill your beloved fans, they would die on

1:36:31.310,1:36:32.310
your ride.

1:36:32.310,1:36:35.890
Gir: I want the lights to just suddenly stop
and then it starts slowing down, and then

1:36:35.890,1:36:36.890
the ride ends.

1:36:36.890,1:36:37.890
Wayne: Y’know what you should do?

1:36:37.890,1:36:41.340
Do one of those spinning wall rides and like,
you-you put a rule up where it’s like, “You

1:36:41.340,1:36:45.000
can’t tell anyone what happens in this ride,”
and you go in, and like, as you’re spinning

1:36:45.000,1:36:47.570
it starts to slow down, and then all of a
sudden the floor drops out from under you

1:36:47.570,1:36:50.679
and you slide down into like, it’s like
funnel shaped, right?

1:36:50.679,1:36:55.090
So you don’t just drop and like, die and
hit the floor, you like slide down the wall

1:36:55.090,1:36:59.110
and you go to the next stage of the ride,
uh, as for what happens down there, I don’t

1:36:59.110,1:37:00.110
know, but—

1:37:00.110,1:37:01.110
Gir: Oh!

1:37:01.110,1:37:02.110
I just thought of the theming!

1:37:02.110,1:37:05.469
The theming of my ride is it’s-it’s [laughs]
It’s hoga-it’s Hogasm!

1:37:05.469,1:37:06.900
Trog: Oh god.

1:37:06.900,1:37:09.050
Wayne: [Laughs] That actually would be great.

1:37:09.050,1:37:11.480
Trog: How is that—That-that- you’re gonna
kill someone.

1:37:11.480,1:37:15.489
Gir: You start the ride and you hear, [in
a deep voice] “Oh, Santa?”

1:37:15.489,1:37:16.489
And then the moment—

1:37:16.489,1:37:17.489
Wayne: [In a deep voice] “We’ve come to—”

1:37:17.489,1:37:19.950
Gir: [In a deep voice] “We’ve come to—Hulk
Hogan, what are you doing here?”

1:37:19.950,1:37:22.260
And then the moment it goes [Gir imitates
a loud, distorted yell] that’s when the

1:37:22.260,1:37:26.850
lights turn off and you start spinning and
then the lights are flashing, and it’s just

1:37:26.850,1:37:28.449
this loud noise [laughs].

1:37:28.449,1:37:31.870
Baaulp: Wayne, when you said, “Oh, you’re
not supposed to tell people what you see on

1:37:31.870,1:37:35.679
this ride,” I thought it was gonna start
spinning and then you were going to project

1:37:35.679,1:37:38.199
something heinous in the middle [laughs].

1:37:38.199,1:37:43.400
Trog: [Laughs] You can’t tell anybody what
we’re showing you.

1:37:43.400,1:37:44.400
[Wayne laughs]

1:37:44.400,1:37:45.400
Trog: What’s yours, Log?

1:37:45.400,1:37:48.430
Log: Uh, I guess a-like a lazy river adventure.

1:37:48.430,1:37:49.430
Trog: Mhmm.

1:37:49.430,1:37:56.190
Log: So you can drift along, that’s fine,
but it would take-the river would take stops

1:37:56.190,1:38:01.600
in like various little constructs that are
like specifically for the lazy river, like

1:38:01.600,1:38:06.340
the lazy river’s the only way that leads
in and out, and so you can go into like-like

1:38:06.340,1:38:12.540
a cave or like a temple, or something, and
you can get out there and there’s like hot

1:38:12.540,1:38:16.670
tubs and little pools and stuff in there,
so you can go to the place that you like the

1:38:16.670,1:38:19.360
best, but you can also just continue on your
adventure.

1:38:19.360,1:38:21.090
Trog: I like that.

1:38:21.090,1:38:22.090
Sounds very relaxing.

1:38:22.090,1:38:23.090
Baaulp: Yeah!

1:38:23.090,1:38:24.090
It sounds like a good, nice time!

1:38:24.090,1:38:28.780
Trog: It’s a nice-nice little resort next
to-right next to MasterGir’s Hell Hogasm

1:38:28.780,1:38:29.780
ride.

1:38:29.780,1:38:30.780
Gir: Hogasm Hell!

1:38:30.780,1:38:33.780
Trog: You just can hear them screaming and
you can hear Hogasm being played at like,

1:38:33.780,1:38:34.780
2 decibels.

1:38:34.780,1:38:39.239
Baaulp: And Baaulp’s ride, where you’re
actively encouraged to get out of your seat

1:38:39.239,1:38:41.770
and get plates of food [laughs].

1:38:41.770,1:38:50.260
Trog: Yeah, um, mine kind of is like Gir’s,
uh, I-I like the idea that, of the y’know,

1:38:50.260,1:38:54.210
just ride that spins you around and around
like, so you’re stuck to the wall—

1:38:54.210,1:38:56.280
Gir: That’s my favorite kind!

1:38:56.280,1:39:00.080
Trog: But specifically, the gimmick of mine
would be that it is constantly playing music,

1:39:00.080,1:39:05.161
and the ride is always synced to the music,
and it’s constantly playing like, crazy

1:39:05.161,1:39:10.800
visuals in the center of the ride, and it’s
just, goin’ nuts.

1:39:10.800,1:39:15.810
And it’s specifically timed so that it works
with the tempo of the music, I think that

1:39:15.810,1:39:16.810
would be cool.

1:39:16.810,1:39:17.810
Baaulp: That’d be cool!

1:39:17.810,1:39:18.810
That’d be cool for a real ride, yeah!

1:39:18.810,1:39:22.040
Gir: I was gonna say, you can probably use
the rotation of the ride to do like a hologram

1:39:22.040,1:39:23.040
type thing.

1:39:23.040,1:39:24.040
Trog: Yeah, exactly.

1:39:24.040,1:39:28.220
So it’s like y’know, whenever you got
to a fair, every single ride is always just

1:39:28.220,1:39:31.640
playing this shitty techno or whatever, and
like—

1:39:31.640,1:39:32.640
Gir: Yeah.

1:39:32.640,1:39:37.480
Trog: That’s fun and all, but the ride is
never synced to the music, I want fair ride,

1:39:37.480,1:39:42.180
but it is one hundred percent synced to the
music, and also it’s playing good music

1:39:42.180,1:39:43.219
instead of bad music.

1:39:43.219,1:39:45.750
Gir: [In a pleading, country accent] “I
want good music in my fair!”

1:39:45.750,1:39:48.000
We had Nu Ma Nu Ma playing at my fair, once.

1:39:48.000,1:39:51.260
Baaulp: So, did we want to come up with a
ride for someone else?

1:39:51.260,1:39:52.739
Or did you want to move on?

1:39:52.739,1:39:57.000
Wayne: Scorpy’s ride is a-is a mirror maze
but with pressure plates that you can step

1:39:57.000,1:40:01.670
on that play extremely loud noises, like,
painfully loud noises.

1:40:01.670,1:40:07.050
Trog: Yeah, I think Scorpy definitely needs
a funhouse for sure in this fictional location.

1:40:07.050,1:40:11.690
Gir: Scorpy’s would be my ride except it’s
just you walk into a room and then get exposed

1:40:11.690,1:40:12.690
to loud noises.

1:40:12.690,1:40:18.770
Log: I think that Scorpy would have a haunted
house ride but the ride-but the track, the

1:40:18.770,1:40:22.570
little riding vehicle goes too fast to see
any of the monsters.

1:40:22.570,1:40:25.090
Gir: I was about to say the same thing!

1:40:25.090,1:40:26.090
It just goes too fast!

1:40:26.090,1:40:27.090
[Baaulp laughs]

1:40:27.090,1:40:28.190
Wayne: So you can’t get scared.

1:40:28.190,1:40:30.250
The first haunted house that can’t scare
you.

1:40:30.250,1:40:36.610
Trog: Scorpy has talked about how he likes
the like, on-rails haunted house rides, so,

1:40:36.610,1:40:37.610
I think he’d probably have one of those.

1:40:37.610,1:40:38.610
Wayne: Yeah.

1:40:38.610,1:40:39.610
Gir: I want the Video Tube.

1:40:39.610,1:40:43.210
Wayne: I also like the idea of the thing that
I said or like the on-rails like monster house

1:40:43.210,1:40:47.340
ride, but it’s connected to a mic that’s
extremely loud that he can just talk into

1:40:47.340,1:40:49.340
and talk at you whenever he wants.

1:40:49.340,1:40:52.050
Trog: Like he has to be there to operate this.

1:40:52.050,1:40:53.050
Wayne: Yeah.

1:40:53.050,1:40:54.050
He could do it remotely.

1:40:54.050,1:40:58.199
Gir: Guys, the collective crown jewel, the
collective crown jewel is the Video Tube.

1:40:58.199,1:40:59.199
Baaulp: Ohhhh.

1:40:59.199,1:41:00.199
Wayne: Oh, yeah!

1:41:00.199,1:41:01.199
Trog: Oh, yeah, a real life Video Tube, hell
yeah.

1:41:01.199,1:41:05.240
Gir: You go into the ride, and there’s like
a computer at the start of the ride, you load

1:41:05.240,1:41:07.150
up, max five videos—

1:41:07.150,1:41:08.929
Baaulp: You can search for any video on the
Internet!

1:41:08.929,1:41:12.840
Gir: Yeah, you load ‘em up, you get in the
ride, and then you go through-you do the Video

1:41:12.840,1:41:15.889
Tube with your videos, and then once the videos
are all done you get off, the next person

1:41:15.889,1:41:17.250
comes on, picks their videos.

1:41:17.250,1:41:21.369
Trog: I love that, because that’s really
sort of like a choose your own adventure-type

1:41:21.369,1:41:22.369
ride—

1:41:22.369,1:41:23.369
Gir: It is.

1:41:23.369,1:41:24.369
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:41:24.369,1:41:26.349
Trog: —where it could either be a nice,
relaxing ride, or it could be the worst thirty

1:41:26.349,1:41:27.349
minutes of your life.

1:41:27.349,1:41:28.960
Gir: Or just nightmare fuel.

1:41:28.960,1:41:30.090
Baaulp: Stinky Botte ten times!

1:41:30.090,1:41:34.440
Wayne: And if you’re not sure, we have a
preset list of videos to pick from uh, with

1:41:34.440,1:41:38.790
beautiful options such as, “Video Pizza,”
“Hebrew Clown with Babies,” uh, “will.i.am.

1:41:38.790,1:41:39.790
entertainment tonight song—”

1:41:39.790,1:41:41.590
Gir: You have a default set—

1:41:41.590,1:41:43.449
Trog: Uh, [burp sound effect] Factory.

1:41:43.449,1:41:44.449
Log: [Laughs] Noooo!

1:41:44.449,1:41:45.449
Wayne: Nooo.

1:41:45.449,1:41:46.449
[Gir laughs]

1:41:46.449,1:41:50.340
Wayne: That’s how we get a fucking arrest
warrant and the park gets closed down.

1:41:50.340,1:41:51.340
[Baaulp laughs]

1:41:51.340,1:41:55.690
Trog: We can’t disengage the locks on the
doors, we have four people stuck in there.

1:41:55.690,1:41:59.550
Wayne: You shouldn’t have even said that,
censor-censor what he said, because someone

1:41:59.550,1:42:01.719
will search on YouTube and find it and we
will be liable.

1:42:01.719,1:42:04.270
Baaulp: I’ll censor it, I will actually
censor what you said.

1:42:04.270,1:42:05.270
Trog: What?

1:42:05.270,1:42:06.400
No, the people have to know.

1:42:06.400,1:42:07.719
Wayne: You do not want to see [burp sound
effect] Factory.

1:42:07.719,1:42:08.719
Trog: Well now you’re going to have to censor
that, too.

1:42:08.719,1:42:09.719
Gir: Censor it by going [in a deep voice]
“Uh-oh.”

1:42:09.719,1:42:11.000
Wayne: Censor half of it.

1:42:11.000,1:42:14.650
Trog: [Laughs] Which half?

1:42:14.650,1:42:15.650
Nobody knows.

1:42:15.650,1:42:17.390
Gir: Yeah, just say [burp sound effect plays
once, then again].

1:42:17.390,1:42:18.390
Wayne: BEEP Factory.

1:42:18.390,1:42:20.350
Gir: No, I want just [burp sound effect].

1:42:20.350,1:42:22.340
Wayne: [Burp sound effect] blank, no that
sounds worse.

1:42:22.340,1:42:25.460
Trog: Yeah, you can’t, don’t make me sound
like a fucking freak, please.

1:42:25.460,1:42:26.460
Gir: Oh, [laughs] you’re right.

1:42:26.460,1:42:27.460
Wayne: Yeah, I mean—

1:42:27.460,1:42:31.179
Gir: Yeah, ‘cause you’re not a freak for
suggesting [burp sound effect] Factory!

1:42:31.179,1:42:32.960
Wayne: …I mean [laughs]—

1:42:32.960,1:42:33.960
[Baaulp laughs]

1:42:33.960,1:42:34.960
Wayne: We’re all freaks.

1:42:34.960,1:42:35.960
Gir: Oh, god.

1:42:35.960,1:42:36.960
Baaulp: Oh, fucking hell.

1:42:36.960,1:42:37.960
Wayne: Alright.

1:42:37.960,1:42:39.920
Baaulp: I think Wayne’s uh, ride would be
real quick, I think it’d be—

1:42:39.920,1:42:40.920
Gir: Wayne’s World.

1:42:40.920,1:42:44.980
Baaulp: They put you into giant—It’s like
bumper cars, but instead of bumper cars they

1:42:44.980,1:42:52.090
put you into giant, animatronic like-like
mech-gorilla mechs and you just have to beat

1:42:52.090,1:42:53.290
the shit out of each other.

1:42:53.290,1:42:57.280
Wayne: Like-like Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em robots,
but you can do it-you get to play.

1:42:57.280,1:43:02.060
Yeah, that’d be a pretty dope arcade attraction,
you remember how when we went to the video

1:43:02.060,1:43:04.060
game museum they had like, giant Pong?

1:43:04.060,1:43:08.130
Like, imagine giant Rock ‘Em Sock ‘Em
robots where you like sat on either side and

1:43:08.130,1:43:09.980
controlled it, like that’d be pretty fun.

1:43:09.980,1:43:14.680
Gir: One-one last one, Erarg would have a
petting zoo but it’s exclusively dogs.

1:43:14.680,1:43:16.780
Baaulp: It’s just a dog zoo!

1:43:16.780,1:43:17.780
Gir: Yeah.

1:43:17.780,1:43:20.550
Trog: I would feel a little bad about charging
people for that, but y’know.

1:43:20.550,1:43:21.590
Gir: No, it’d be free.

1:43:21.590,1:43:22.929
You charge-you charge for treats.

1:43:22.929,1:43:24.500
Baaulp: Ohhh, yeahhh.

1:43:24.500,1:43:26.460
Gir: Like a real petting zoo.

1:43:26.460,1:43:27.700
A real petting zoo does that.

1:43:27.700,1:43:29.150
Wayne: Whose dogs are they?

1:43:29.150,1:43:30.310
Whose dogs are they?

1:43:30.310,1:43:31.310
Trog: They’re your dogs, Wayne.

1:43:31.310,1:43:32.310
It’s your amusement park.

1:43:32.310,1:43:34.400
You’ll have to take care of all these dogs.

1:43:34.400,1:43:35.400
Wayne: Okay [laughs].

1:43:35.400,1:43:37.440
Gir: We just bring our own dogs [laughs]!

1:43:37.440,1:43:41.710
Baaulp: Honestly, I’d go to a dog zoo, just,
“Hey, we got one of every dog!”

1:43:41.710,1:43:43.030
Gir: That’s a lot of dogs!

1:43:43.030,1:43:44.730
Wayne: As long as they’re well taken care
of.

1:43:44.730,1:43:45.869
Trog: That’s a lot of dogs.

1:43:45.869,1:43:47.989
Wayne: It’s kind of just a shelter, at that
point.

1:43:47.989,1:43:50.510
Gir: You can let them adopt them!

1:43:50.510,1:43:52.400
Have the local shelter supply dogs!

1:43:52.400,1:43:57.550
Wayne: We didn’t know where we’d begin,
but we know how we’re wrapping it up, at

1:43:57.550,1:43:58.550
least I do.

1:43:58.550,1:43:59.550
Baaulp: Peppers.

1:43:59.550,1:44:00.550
Gir: With peppers.

1:44:00.550,1:44:02.110
Wayne: Thank you for listening, if you have
questions for the next episode, please join

1:44:02.110,1:44:05.460
the WayneRadioTV Discord and look for the
podcast questions channel.

1:44:05.460,1:44:09.440
Make sure you ask good questions that aren’t
jokes, they can be funny, but don’t try.

1:44:09.440,1:44:10.440
Or—

1:44:10.440,1:44:11.440
Gir: Don’t try.

1:44:11.440,1:44:12.830
Wayne: It’s a complicated subject.

1:44:12.830,1:44:19.110
Go to discord.gg/WayneRadioTV if you want
to see my streams and the group’s, twitch.tv/wayneradiotv,

1:44:25.130,1:44:27.409
Gir: Trog, you first.

1:44:27.409,1:44:31.980
Wayne: Log’s too tired, Log need a nappy.

1:44:31.980,1:44:33.690
Log: I do.

1:44:33.690,1:44:40.480
Trog: Yeah, I’m on Twitch sometimes, twitch.tv/tr0g,
um, only other thing I have to plug will have

1:44:40.480,1:44:43.090
already happened by the time this goes up,
so—

1:44:43.090,1:44:44.090
Baaulp: Uh-huh, yeah.

1:44:44.090,1:44:50.000
Trog: I hope you enjoyed the Funny Rave and
uh, I’m sure it was great, even though it

1:44:50.000,1:44:53.270
hasn’t happened yet for me, but it has happened
for you.

1:44:53.270,1:44:55.449
Baaulp: But it will happen for you, yes, you
better have tuned in.

1:44:55.449,1:44:56.760
Trog: Yeah, so watch it.

1:44:56.760,1:44:58.600
Baaulp: If not, uh, look it up.

1:44:58.600,1:45:00.640
Gir: Sorry, I’m going to be busy, I assume.

1:45:00.640,1:45:02.099
Wayne: I’ll be watching.

1:45:02.099,1:45:03.610
Baaulp: I am Baaulp—

1:45:03.610,1:45:04.610
Gir: Hi.

1:45:04.610,1:45:06.130
Baaulp: Look for me on Twitch—

1:45:06.130,1:45:08.580
Wayne: Oh, we’re doing intros, I thought
this was the outro.

1:45:08.580,1:45:09.580
[Baaulp scoffs]

1:45:09.580,1:45:10.580
[Gir laughs]

1:45:10.580,1:45:12.940
Wayne: I am Wayne [laughs].

1:45:12.940,1:45:21.110
Baaulp: Look for Baaulp, B-A-A-U-L-P on YouTube,

Gir: MasterGir, Twitch, Twitter, Youtube.

1:45:27.070,1:45:31.100
Wayne: You just have a website you can link
to, BigWarp, right?

1:45:31.100,1:45:34.380
Gir: Yeah, bigwarp.com has all the links to
all my shit.

1:45:34.380,1:45:38.060
Wayne: I promote my-I promote be friends better
than they promote themselves.

1:45:38.060,1:45:40.540
Gir: I forget about it.

1:45:40.540,1:45:43.400
Wayne: [Laughs] Logmore.

1:45:43.400,1:45:47.380
Log: [Sighs] twitch.tv/logmore, twitter.com/logblaster,
but—

1:45:47.380,1:45:50.369
Wayne: Promo code: Gather Ye Power.

1:45:50.369,1:45:54.739
Log: Yeah, you can Google Gather Ye Power
and get straight to the business of it.

1:45:54.739,1:45:55.739
Take one back.

1:45:55.739,1:45:58.570
Wayne: Get a free comic by Googling promo
code, “Gather Ye Power.”

1:45:58.570,1:46:00.560
Baaulp: Oh my god, you don’t have to pay?

1:46:00.560,1:46:01.560
Holy shit!

1:46:01.560,1:46:03.570
Wayne: Yeah, it’s free comics!

1:46:03.570,1:46:04.860
Log: No pay.

1:46:04.860,1:46:05.860
Baaulp: Wow.

1:46:05.860,1:46:07.520
Gir: I thought Baaulp was about to be like,
“Oh my god, you don’t have to promote

1:46:07.520,1:46:08.520
him!”

1:46:08.520,1:46:10.640
Wayne: Anyways, now that the podcast is all
wrapped up, you guys wanna play Peppers?

1:46:10.640,1:46:11.640
Baaulp: Hell yeah!

1:46:11.640,1:46:13.050
Alright, let me see what I got.

1:46:13.050,1:46:14.490
Wayne: Alright I’m going-I’m going first.

1:46:14.490,1:46:16.020
I get first dibs, I get first dibs.

1:46:16.020,1:46:17.260
Baaulp: Okay, okay, okay.

1:46:17.260,1:46:18.260
[Wayne inhales]

1:46:18.260,1:46:19.260
[Biting sound effect plays]

1:46:19.260,1:46:20.260
Wayne, panting: Ah!

1:46:20.260,1:46:21.260
Hot.

1:46:21.260,1:46:22.260
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot!

1:46:22.260,1:46:23.900
Log: You’re not supposed to eat them yet.

1:46:23.900,1:46:24.900
Wayne: What?

1:46:24.900,1:46:26.920
What was I s’posed to do?

1:46:26.920,1:46:28.800
Trog: You’ve broken the first rule of Peppers.

1:46:28.800,1:46:31.540
Log: You have to toss it in the air and then
pick up the seeds.

1:46:31.540,1:46:33.320
Wayne: Well I already ate it.

1:46:33.320,1:46:35.260
Log: Well, I guess we can’t play anymore.

1:46:35.260,1:46:36.480
[Puff of air sound effect plays]

1:46:36.480,1:46:37.480
Gir: Oh!

1:46:37.480,1:46:38.480
My-my pepper released a noxious gas!

1:46:38.480,1:46:39.929
What do I do?

1:46:39.929,1:46:42.550
Log: Alright, Let-let’s [sighs] I’ll get
my wireless pepper.

1:46:42.550,1:46:45.770
It’s got a bit of delay, but we can try
it.

1:46:45.770,1:46:47.239
Wayne: Wave pepper [laughs].

1:46:47.239,1:46:48.480
[Baaulp laughs]

1:46:48.480,1:46:52.600
Log: Make sure to set it to channel 3.

1:46:52.600,1:46:55.800
Wayne: Bro, did you cat pee on this pepper?

1:46:55.800,1:46:56.800
This shit’s gross!

1:46:56.800,1:47:04.380
Baaulp: I’m sorry, I’m sorry, the only
one we got is this Mad Catz uh, Fresno Frenzy

1:47:04.380,1:47:05.510
pepper, um, sorry.

1:47:05.510,1:47:07.000
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

1:47:07.000,1:47:10.080
Trog: Buddy, it’s a little sticky, but it
works.

1:47:10.080,1:47:11.080
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:47:11.080,1:47:12.840
Gir: Yeah, my-my little brother chewed on
the stem.

1:47:12.840,1:47:22.240
Wayne: New pepper hybrid, the Fresno Frenzy
pepper, coming to you soon, official RadioTVSolutions

1:47:22.240,1:47:25.190

0:00:24.019,0:00:30.789
Wayne: Hello and welcome to The Podcast #1:
The Future of Podcasting. My name is Wayne.

0:00:30.789,0:00:31.789
Trog: My name is Trog.

0:00:31.789,0:00:32.880
Baaulp: I'm Baaulp.

0:00:32.880,0:00:33.880
Log: I'm Log!

0:00:33.880,0:00:34.880
Gir: I'm Gir.

0:00:34.880,0:00:40.640
Wayne: And today, we're gonna be doin' a podcast.
It's the first... and the best... #1. And

0:00:40.640,0:00:45.950
I think we have some things we're gonna talk
about today. Some topics, some questions.

0:00:45.950,0:00:50.059
Log: You're really excited. I'm not talkin'
to Wayne, I'm talkin' to you, the listener,

0:00:50.059,0:00:51.059
[crosstalk] you're so excited.

0:00:51.059,0:00:52.059
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:00:52.059,0:00:53.059
Gir: You don't even realize it yet.

0:00:53.059,0:00:59.059
Baaulp: We live in your phone. I live next
to your battery and I like to walk over past

0:00:59.059,0:01:04.940
those capacitors there, close to where your
phone speaker is, and hang out at my friend

0:01:04.940,0:01:11.090
Wayne's place. We play video games on tiny
consoles. Did anyone, like, do anything interesting

0:01:11.090,0:01:15.630
these last few weeks, or play any games, or
see any movies, or anything you wanna talk

0:01:15.630,0:01:16.630
about?

0:01:16.630,0:01:17.630
Trog: [crosstalk] I did.

0:01:17.630,0:01:18.630
Log: No, next question.

0:01:18.630,0:01:24.210
Trog: What? No, I did. I did. Because I, over
the last two weeks— no, less than that,

0:01:24.210,0:01:29.880
over the last week, I watched EVERY English
episode of Dragon Ball Super, and I think

0:01:29.880,0:01:30.880
almost—

0:01:30.880,0:01:32.479
Baaulp: You just marathoned the whole thing,
like the entirety of it?

0:01:32.479,0:01:39.270
Trog: I got up to like, I don't know, Episode
30, and then took a month break, and then

0:01:39.270,0:01:43.579
came back and watched the next 40, [crosstalk]
and my review?

0:01:43.579,0:01:44.710
Baaulp: Damn.

0:01:44.710,0:01:52.420
Trog: Good. Good, although I don't know if
its, like, ACTUALLY good, or if I just really

0:01:52.420,0:01:55.789
like those characters. I'm not sure, I don't
know.

0:01:55.789,0:02:01.460
Wayne: I love Dragon Ball Z, and I really
like Dragon Ball Super, but Dragon Ball Super—

0:02:01.460,0:02:06.110
I don't know about the manga, but as an anime—I
was talking about this earlier—Dragon Ball

0:02:06.110,0:02:10.729
Super, if it was not those characters but
the same exact story, and the same exact story

0:02:10.729,0:02:15.700
mechanics, it would suck. It'd be so bad,
[crosstalk] it would be awful. It would be

0:02:15.700,0:02:16.700
so bad.

0:02:16.700,0:02:17.700
Trog: Yeah, I kinda get that same feeling.

0:02:17.700,0:02:21.040
Baaulp: So I never watched any of Super, did
they just phone it in or what?

0:02:21.040,0:02:22.040
Trog: No, no, no.

0:02:22.040,0:02:23.560
Wayne: [crosstalk] No, it's all Akira Toriyama.

0:02:23.560,0:02:29.140
Trog: It's good. It's all good. It's good,
it's just like— it's good in that weird

0:02:29.140,0:02:32.840
Dragon Ball campy-ness, I don't know, it's—

0:02:32.840,0:02:37.030
Wayne: Dragon Ball Z was already so heightened
and like, where can you take it from there

0:02:37.030,0:02:38.690
without it seeming like a fanfiction?

0:02:38.690,0:02:39.690
Trog: Yeah.

0:02:39.690,0:02:41.560
Wayne: That's kinda the problem that Dragon
Ball Super has.

0:02:41.560,0:02:47.780
Trog: Exactly. It gets really silly in terms
of all the power level stuff. They have to

0:02:47.780,0:02:52.950
keep amping it up and stuff, and it gets kinda
silly, but I think it's still good, and I

0:02:52.950,0:02:56.239
still really like it, and I would definitely
recommend it, but...

0:02:56.239,0:03:02.620
Wayne: So here's the synopsis to my new fanfiction,
Dragon Ball Ultra, alright; Goku becomes so

0:03:02.620,0:03:06.920
strong, now he's a god. And he fights a god,
but he's not actually a god, it turns out.

0:03:06.920,0:03:11.440
Goku's not actually a god, he just has god-like
power levels. And then Frieza comes back from

0:03:11.440,0:03:15.989
the dead and he's GOLDEN. And then Vegeta
fights a ROBOT full of LAVA. AND THEN... and

0:03:15.989,0:03:16.989
then GOKU—

0:03:16.989,0:03:20.909
Baaulp: Does that happen? Did he fight a robot
full of lava?

0:03:20.909,0:03:21.909
Trog: Yes, he did.

0:03:21.909,0:03:23.880
Wayne: And then Evil Goku comes, and he KILLS
CHICHI!

0:03:23.880,0:03:24.880
Gir: In that order.

0:03:24.880,0:03:29.090
Trog: You missed an important part, because
everybody's favorite character, Future Trunks,

0:03:29.090,0:03:31.330
comes back AGAIN for some reason—

0:03:31.330,0:03:32.360
Wayne: [crosstalk] And he can't do shit.

0:03:32.360,0:03:34.000
Trog: And THEN Evil Goku shows up.

0:03:34.000,0:03:39.010
Wayne: And he can't do shit, because Evil
Goku is THOUSANDS of times stronger than Trunks.

0:03:39.010,0:03:42.049
Gir: I would like to touch on something real
quick, uh, Trog.

0:03:42.049,0:03:43.049
Trog: What?

0:03:43.049,0:03:45.849
Gir: Why the fuck do you hate the Pilaf Gang
so much?

0:03:45.849,0:03:46.849
Trog: I don't know—

0:03:46.849,0:03:47.849
Wayne: [crosstalk] They're annoying as shit!

0:03:47.849,0:03:49.750
Trog: Yeah, I just find them really annoying.

0:03:49.750,0:03:51.480
Gir: They're not that bad!

0:03:51.480,0:03:56.349
Trog: Like, I don't get too bothered by filler
but, yeah, I don't know. Something about any

0:03:56.349,0:04:01.440
filler involving them just made me really
upset. I think it's like... I don't know,

0:04:01.440,0:04:05.630
they're just annoying, and useless, and you
know that if they're in an episode, they're

0:04:05.630,0:04:09.120
not gonna do anything. They're just gonna,
like, yell, and be annoying.

0:04:09.120,0:04:14.239
Wayne: Yeah, it's also like, maybe it wouldn't
be that bad, but they're there too much. They

0:04:14.239,0:04:20.190
stop after a certain point but they will get,
like, 5 minutes of an episode MULTIPLE times

0:04:20.190,0:04:23.510
during an arc, [crosstalk] like in the Goku
Black arc.

0:04:23.510,0:04:24.510
Trog: Yeah.

0:04:24.510,0:04:27.419
Wayne: Any other interesting things happen
to you this week, or topics you'd like to

0:04:27.419,0:04:32.340
talk about? Oh, I have one actually. Or Log,
you go first, since you were not involved

0:04:32.340,0:04:33.650
in that conversation at all.

0:04:33.650,0:04:38.960
Log: Yeah, welcome to the official podcast—
the Dragon Ball podcast you never knew about.

0:04:38.960,0:04:41.010
Gir: It's gonna keep happening.

0:04:41.010,0:04:48.630
Log: Here's my Dragon Ball fact: last weekend
I helped put up a fence. I've never done that

0:04:48.630,0:04:51.850
before. It's really bad, actually, you shouldn't
do it.

0:04:51.850,0:04:55.120
Wayne: You put it up from nothing? Like, you
installed the whole thing?

0:04:55.120,0:04:59.190
Log: Well, there was a preexisting fence and
it was bad. [crosstalk] So we had to—

0:04:59.190,0:05:00.190
[5:00]

0:05:00.190,0:05:01.390
Wayne: Was this a chain link fence, or was
this a picket, wooden—

0:05:01.390,0:05:02.390
Gir: Yeah, I was about to ask.

0:05:02.390,0:05:03.390
Log: It's wooden.

0:05:03.390,0:05:04.390
Gir: Wood?

0:05:04.390,0:05:05.390
Baaulp: Wood.

0:05:05.390,0:05:10.271
Log: My grandpa found a good deal on these
prebuilt sections of a wooden fence, so he

0:05:10.271,0:05:20.090
bought like, 10, and just stacked them in
the yard of my uncle's house. So today we

0:05:20.090,0:05:24.530
decided—or not today—on the weekend, we
decided to try and start putting up some of

0:05:24.530,0:05:29.060
those things, knocking down the old shitty
fence, and putting in the new wooden fence

0:05:29.060,0:05:36.410
that was good. I don't like that. It's not—
it doesn't work. You need two people to move

0:05:36.410,0:05:43.639
the pieces of fence, right, so that's already
bad. Y'know, wasps hang out there. [crosstalk]

0:05:43.639,0:05:45.250
Dirt hangs out there.

0:05:45.250,0:05:50.060
Wayne: Oh my god. Wasps are like... I have
a connection to this story in the summer that

0:05:50.060,0:05:55.000
I painted my dad's wooden fence, and wasps
were a big part of it. I'd say maybe 50% of

0:05:55.000,0:06:01.389
my time painting that fence was spent avoiding
wasps, and I fucking HATE wasps. They are

0:06:01.389,0:06:02.389
my enemy.

0:06:02.389,0:06:05.130
Gir: Yeah, I got my first wasp sting in like...
15 years.

0:06:05.130,0:06:10.120
Baaulp: What did it feel like? I've never
been stung by a wasp or a bee.

0:06:10.120,0:06:14.009
Gir: It felt like a hot needle being rammed
into me.

0:06:14.009,0:06:20.569
Trog: You know how people would describe a
pain as a stinging pain? That's where that

0:06:20.569,0:06:21.569
comes from, Baaulp.

0:06:21.569,0:06:22.590
Wayne: That's why they say it's a bee sting.

0:06:22.590,0:06:26.669
Gir: The wasp's sting felt like a sting.

0:06:26.669,0:06:32.470
Baaulp: That's the basis? I'm surprised I
haven't been stung by a wasp or anything,

0:06:32.470,0:06:35.630
because I would hang out at my friend Spencer's
house all the time [crosstalk] back in high

0:06:35.630,0:06:36.630
school, and at the—

0:06:36.630,0:06:37.630
Trog: And cover yourself in maple syrup.

0:06:37.630,0:06:42.830
Wayne: And I'd roll around underneath the
beehive, and they wouldn't even come get me.

0:06:42.830,0:06:44.370
Gir: I think they'd avoid you.

0:06:44.370,0:06:49.530
Baaulp: No, he just had a wasps nest at the
very top of his house [crosstalk] that he

0:06:49.530,0:06:50.530
could never get rid of.

0:06:50.530,0:06:51.629
Gir: That's where he kept it. He kept it there.

0:06:51.629,0:06:54.490
Trog: That he cultivated, raising wasps.

0:06:54.490,0:06:58.580
Wayne: He owned one, it was his— it was
HIS wasp nest.

0:06:58.580,0:07:03.520
Trog: "Hey guys, wanna come over and see my
cool wasp nest? I've been training them to

0:07:03.520,0:07:04.520
attack."

0:07:04.520,0:07:05.520
Wayne: "You wanna see my wasp?"

0:07:05.520,0:07:06.940
Gir: "It makes this tight noise when I hit
it."

0:07:06.940,0:07:11.290
Log: "I've raised them from birth, I know
each one."

0:07:11.290,0:07:12.842
Trog: [crosstalk] "I'm the Wasp King."

0:07:12.842,0:07:13.842
Wayne: "Wanna come to my house and get stung?"

0:07:13.842,0:07:16.729
Trog: "My name is Tyler the Wasp King, and
I will take over all of Boston."

0:07:16.729,0:07:18.910
Log: "Hey bro, you wanna do a wasp?"

0:07:18.910,0:07:22.540
Gir: He asked you to come over and get fucked
up, but he meant get attacked by wasps.

0:07:22.540,0:07:26.970
Wayne: Alright, so I've got a tangent to take
from this. So for those of you who are NOT

0:07:26.970,0:07:31.550
Baaulp and HAVE been stung by bees, what is
your worst bee sting story? Like, what's the

0:07:31.550,0:07:37.009
worst— was there ever a time where it wasn't
just ONE bee, have you ever had an encounter

0:07:37.009,0:07:38.009
like that?

0:07:38.009,0:07:39.379
Baaulp: Oh my god, that's like straight out
of RuneScape.

0:07:39.379,0:07:42.289
Gir: I didn't have multiple, but I did get
stung right on my ass.

0:07:42.289,0:07:43.289
Trog: [crosstalk] How?

0:07:43.289,0:07:44.289
Gir: That sucked.

0:07:44.289,0:07:45.289
Trog: Why were your pants off?

0:07:45.289,0:07:46.479
Gir: [crosstalk] I don't— I was a kid and
we were swimming

0:07:46.479,0:07:48.190
Wayne: Gir was mooning the bees.

0:07:48.190,0:07:50.530
Gir: Huhuhuh, check this out, little dumbasses.

0:07:50.530,0:07:56.139
Wayne: You started mooning the bees and immediately
they beelined it for your ass.

0:07:56.139,0:07:58.229
Gir: Hey, that's that kids ass!

0:07:58.229,0:08:00.000
Wayne: We know that ass, [crosstalk] go get
it!

0:08:00.000,0:08:01.509
Gir: We know that ass!

0:08:01.509,0:08:09.099
Log: It's like, y'know, the olden times where
you'd get your cat mad at you, so he'll just

0:08:09.099,0:08:13.230
take a wasp and put it underneath the cushion
of your seat right as you're about to sit

0:08:13.230,0:08:14.230
down.

0:08:14.230,0:08:15.230
Wayne: [crosstalk] What?

0:08:15.230,0:08:16.230
Gir: Was your cat Garfield?

0:08:16.230,0:08:17.230
Trog: Your cat?

0:08:17.230,0:08:18.230
Wayne: Was your cat sentient?

0:08:18.230,0:08:20.510
Baaulp: I don't think cats ever did that,
and he's trying to make a reference to Tom

0:08:20.510,0:08:21.690
and Jerry, so...

0:08:21.690,0:08:25.629
Log: Yeah, y'know, it's like back in those
days where cats wore gloves all the time.

0:08:25.629,0:08:26.629
Gir: Oh...

0:08:26.629,0:08:28.830
Trog: Oh right, where all animals wore gloves.

0:08:28.830,0:08:35.550
Log: Yeah, and then you'd fly up and you'd
take damage from both ends, [crosstalk] 'cause

0:08:35.550,0:08:41.529
you get stung, and then you fly up out of
your seat, and impact your skull on the ceiling—

0:08:41.529,0:08:42.529
Gir: And you go "AHHHH!"

0:08:42.529,0:08:43.529
Wayne: [crosstalk] How much damage?

0:08:43.529,0:08:44.529
Log: So it's like a double damage.

0:08:44.529,0:08:45.529
Wayne: How much?

0:08:45.529,0:08:46.529
Log: It's like double damage.

0:08:46.529,0:08:47.529
Gir: You get double donked.

0:08:47.529,0:08:51.980
Wayne: Alright, well, I have a bee story.
So, when I was a kid I used to have to mow

0:08:51.980,0:08:56.270
the lawn all the time, we had a really big
lawn with many levels. It was a cool place.

0:08:56.270,0:08:59.329
Gir: You make it to Level 2?

0:08:59.329,0:09:04.300
Wayne: Yeah. We also used to have a lot of
pool parties, and you know pool parties, you

0:09:04.300,0:09:08.271
got the snacks, you got the soda, you got
the soda can. And some people didn't like

0:09:08.271,0:09:12.269
to clean up after themselves, so sometimes
I'd find trash leftover from the party, and

0:09:12.269,0:09:17.500
we'd have to clean it up. And one time I was
mowin' the lawn, and I saw a can of Sprite

0:09:17.500,0:09:20.800
laying down on the lawn, [crosstalk] and I
was like, oh boy, a can of Sprite!

0:09:20.800,0:09:21.800
Baaulp: Uh oh!

0:09:21.800,0:09:22.839
Trog: I can't wait to drink this!

0:09:22.839,0:09:26.019
Gir: Can't wait to drink this soda off the
ground!

0:09:26.019,0:09:28.140
Baaulp: Oh tight, free Sprite!

0:09:28.140,0:09:29.769
Trog: So yummy!

0:09:29.769,0:09:34.340
Wayne: I cant wait to clean up this can and
please my parents for being a good— doing

0:09:34.340,0:09:40.899
a good job! And I picked it up, and underneath
that can, I saw a hole in the ground, and

0:09:40.899,0:09:41.899
I was like—

0:09:41.899,0:09:42.899
Baaulp: [crosstalk] Oh sick, free hole!

0:09:42.899,0:09:46.820
Wayne: Huh! I wonder what this hole is! And
I stuck my head in— no, I didn't do that,

0:09:46.820,0:09:47.820
[crosstalk] but I—

0:09:47.820,0:09:48.820
Trog: Ah, it's the Sprite hole.

0:09:48.820,0:09:52.740
Wayne: I observed the hole, and then I looked
at the can after I heard a buzzing coming

0:09:52.740,0:09:57.701
from the can. And you know how in the games,
and the movies, and the cartoons, when you

0:09:57.701,0:10:00.790
get stung by a bee, it's like a cloud of bees?

0:10:00.790,0:10:01.790

0:10:01.790,0:10:02.790

Baaulp: Multiple bees came out?

0:10:06.790,0:10:08.511
Wayne: From the can. I think they were like,
digger hornets or whatever, 'cause they were

0:10:08.511,0:10:09.511
diggin' a hole—

0:10:09.511,0:10:10.511

Gir: [crosstalk] Those things hurt.

0:10:12.060,0:10:16.170
Wayne: Cloud of bees out of the hole, out
of the can, and this is where my phobia of

0:10:16.170,0:10:17.240
bees stems from.

0:10:17.240,0:10:19.540
Log: And then you became the bee boy.

0:10:19.540,0:10:23.750
Wayne: I ran away and sat in my house forever,
and then I never went outside again.

0:10:23.750,0:10:29.600
Trog: Did you go out of your way to try to
exact revenge against ALL stinging insects?

0:10:29.600,0:10:35.670
Wayne: Yeah, I mean, later on. And then—
so, we also had a shed right next to that

0:10:35.670,0:10:40.500
hole, and that shed was really, really old,
and there was a lot of stuff in there that

0:10:40.500,0:10:45.120
we didn't really use. Basically one half of
the shed was dedicated to pool stuff that

0:10:45.120,0:10:48.470
we put away in the winter, and the other half
was dedicated to our tractor, and then there

0:10:48.470,0:10:53.130
was other stuff in there that we didn't really
touch. And we used the two shed doors that

0:10:53.130,0:10:57.790
were like these big, bulky things that were
giant, and then there was an actual house

0:10:57.790,0:11:02.480
door on it, for some reason. We never used
that house door. One day we decided to open

0:11:02.480,0:11:09.370
it, and the fucking most— the biggest wasp
nest was inside of it, and that was horrifying.

0:11:09.370,0:11:15.230
But let me tell you, the feeling of using
some Raid on that shit? Oh my god. Sweet,

0:11:15.230,0:11:16.230
sweet revenge.

are you talkin' about?

0:11:22.110,0:11:27.520
Log: You have sheds in some houses around,
y'know. Or in the backyards or whatever. I

0:11:27.520,0:11:31.930
feel like sheds are predominately like a wildlife
cultivation center, [crosstalk] more than

0:11:31.930,0:11:32.930
a storage unit.

0:11:32.930,0:11:35.460

a storage unit—

Log: I've never known somebody that actually
uses their shed.

0:11:39.149,0:11:44.250
Wayne: It's complete risk/reward. The reward
is you get to put your tractor in it, and

0:11:44.250,0:11:47.529
the risk is that beavers— I mean... not
beavers...

Baaulp: Those beaver swarms, they make their
nests everywhere!

0:11:52.779,0:11:56.399
Wayne: Woodchucks will create a home under
it, and wasps will take it over, and then

0:11:56.399,0:11:57.600
you have to fight for your tractor.

we had a shed, and it wasn't used for storage,

0:12:06.450,0:12:08.580
it was just MY personal playhouse.

When I was a kid, I liked trying to get lizards.

0:13:11.389,0:13:15.880
I liked to pick up the lizards, you know what
I mean?

0:13:15.880,0:13:18.850

GET.

Gir: But here's the thing—

0:13:21.850,0:13:25.480
Baaulp: I don't know why, but I like to imagine
that they wouldn't run from you [crosstalk]

0:13:25.480,0:13:26.700
and you would just pick them up nonchalantly.

0:13:26.700,0:13:28.590

0:13:28.590,0:13:30.750
Wayne: They didn't want to be picked up.

0:13:30.750,0:13:34.589
Gir: There was one time where I noticed a
snake, and I knew that the snakes in the area

0:13:34.589,0:13:39.260
were... safe, they were like garden snakes.
But I went to go get it, and I reached my

0:13:39.260,0:13:42.449
hand into the hole that it went into, like
"Ah man, this is a deep hole, I can't find

0:13:42.449,0:13:47.230
that snake!". I pulled my hand back out, my
hand is not my hand anymore. It is now a mass

0:13:47.230,0:13:49.029
of ants in the shape of my hand.

What is with you guys and sticking your hands

0:14:02.240,0:14:03.240
in holes [crosstalk] and picking up random
cans of Sprite?

you get seven weeks of summer.

0:15:25.550,0:15:33.600
Baaulp: No joke, we were eating Go-Gurt, and
then we started— we were just talking to

0:15:33.600,0:15:39.190
each other, but then we started feeling itchy
and then we looked down, and at some point

0:15:39.190,0:15:48.449
from under us—we were just sitting on some
steps—once a year, ant colonies will have

0:15:48.449,0:15:53.620
mating flights, where they'll actually give
birth to reproductive males and females, and

0:15:53.620,0:15:58.880
they'll have wings, and they'll fly? And so
ants just start swarming around us, and they

0:15:58.880,0:16:02.710
started flying, and I didn't know that as
a kid, I didn't know ants could have wings!

0:17:25.900,0:17:27.040
Baaulp: I don't think I know this story.

0:17:27.040,0:17:31.809
Wayne: Well, the other day, I was at my retail
job at an undisclosed location, I don't know

0:17:31.809,0:17:32.809
where it is.

0:17:32.809,0:17:33.809
Baaulp: Undisclosed company.

0:17:33.809,0:17:34.809
Trog: Denny's.

0:17:34.809,0:17:35.809
Baaulp: [crosstalk] Dark company.

0:17:35.809,0:17:36.809
Wayne: Yes, undisclosed company.

0:17:36.809,0:17:37.809
Gir: Denny's.

0:17:37.809,0:17:39.210
Wayne: I do work at a pet store, [crosstalk]
and my job for the day--

0:17:39.210,0:17:40.210
Trog: Denny's for Pets.

0:17:40.210,0:17:44.730
Wayne: At least during that hour, at Denny's
for Pets, I was the cashier. Near the cash

0:17:44.730,0:17:48.910
register, we sell dog toys, and y'know, in
a store, customers are gonna be there. Customer

0:17:48.910,0:17:54.240
walks up, 60 year old man. He's in a red shirt.
He walks up to the table with dog toys and

0:17:54.240,0:18:01.140
starts shopping very intently, he's very focused.
And generally, if I see a customer who's not

0:18:01.140,0:18:05.190
actively looking for help, or they look like
they're very engaged in the product, I'm not

0:18:05.190,0:18:08.710
gonna say anything to them. I'm not gonna
greet them, or say "Hey, I can ring you out

0:18:08.710,0:18:12.780
over here!" 'cause they're still shopping.
So this dude, he's at the dog toy table, which

0:18:12.780,0:18:17.900
is about 10 feet away from me. Can see him
in plain sight. He picks up a stick. It's

0:18:17.900,0:18:22.460
like a stuffed lion, but it's in the shape
of a stick, it's a squeaky toy. He picks it

0:18:22.460,0:18:26.990
up, he looks at me, he looks back down at
the toy. Squeaks it ten or twelve times, looks

0:18:26.990,0:18:32.140
back up at me, smiles, squeaks it a few more
times, and he walks out the door. With the

0:18:32.140,0:18:40.640
lion in his hands. And store policy for theft
is that you're supposed to try and get their

0:18:40.640,0:18:44.840
attention and try to stop them from going
outside, but once they go outside, you cannot

0:18:44.840,0:18:51.740
leave the store anymore, because then you
are in danger. In this situation, I was so

0:18:51.740,0:18:57.990
bewildered by this man's, like, obvious lack
of stealth and lack of CARE for being stealthy

0:18:57.990,0:19:02.659
while stealing this dog toy, that I just didn't
say anything, I didn't think to. And then

0:19:02.659,0:19:06.110
by the time he walked out the door, I just
sort of followed him and looked outside, and

0:19:06.110,0:19:11.360
I saw him just walk out to his car and he
was just holding it up to his chest, and then

0:19:11.360,0:19:12.940
he got in his car and drove away.

0:19:12.940,0:19:17.909
Trog: See, I love that story, and let me tell
you why. Because now, I feel like I can steal

0:19:17.909,0:19:22.340
anything. [crosstalk] I feel like all you
need—

0:19:22.340,0:19:24.049
Gir: You just have to bewilder everyone.

0:19:24.049,0:19:28.150
Trog: You just need confidence. This just
tells me that all you need in life is enough

0:19:28.150,0:19:33.620
confidence, and you can pull off anything.
You can just shoplift, it doesn't matter.

0:19:33.620,0:19:34.620
[crosstalk] It's all yours.

0:19:34.620,0:19:37.910
Log: And also an item that you can pick up
and take without it setting off alarms.

0:19:37.910,0:19:39.550
Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, that also helps.

0:19:39.550,0:19:41.740
Wayne: Yeah, that too. That's the one limitation.

0:19:41.740,0:19:46.450
Baaulp: I'm gonna go up to a fuckin' general
and just be like, "Oh, can I see your shiny

0:19:46.450,0:19:51.090
nuclear launch key?", and I'll jingle it to
distract him and walk away with it.

0:19:51.090,0:19:53.920
Log: Maybe you have to be able to squeak your
theft item.

0:19:53.920,0:19:55.640
Gir: Yeah, that's the secret to it.

0:19:55.640,0:19:57.620
Baaulp: [crosstalk] You have to squeak it.

0:19:57.620,0:19:59.030
Trog: Yeah, as a distraction.

0:19:59.030,0:20:01.960
Baaulp: Maybe it's not even the squeak, maybe
it was just squeezing it.

0:20:01.960,0:20:02.960
[20:00]

0:20:02.960,0:20:06.660
Baaulp: I'll just order chicken nuggets, and
I'll take one out and I'll squeeze it, and

0:20:06.660,0:20:07.840
then I'll walk away without paying.

0:20:07.840,0:20:12.470
Wayne: It was just, like, obviously he was
right in front of me, obviously he was right

0:20:12.470,0:20:16.480
there, I could see him. But it was the fact
that we made EYE CONTACT and he smiled.

0:20:16.480,0:20:17.500
Trog: 'Cause he knew!

0:20:17.500,0:20:22.070
Wayne: Like what Trog was saying, the confidence,
the raw confidence, just like, "Yeah, this

0:20:22.070,0:20:23.791
things mine." [crosstalk] I'm gonna go outside—

0:20:23.791,0:20:24.791
Trog: He knew.

0:20:24.791,0:20:25.791
Gir: "It's mine now, you little punk!"

0:20:25.791,0:20:27.110
Wayne: I'm gonna go outside and I'm gonna
hug it in the parking lot, and I'm gonna show

0:20:27.110,0:20:30.890
it to my wife, then we're gonna get in the
car and drive away [crosstalk] while the cashiers

0:20:30.890,0:20:31.890
looking.

0:20:31.890,0:20:33.100
Baaulp: Did he do that?

0:20:33.100,0:20:34.570
Wayne: Yes, he did.

0:20:34.570,0:20:36.039
Baaulp: Are you serious?

0:20:36.039,0:20:37.520
Wayne: Yes, he did.

0:20:37.520,0:20:42.950
Baaulp: I have a friend who is a butcher,
[crosstalk] and he told me about this couple—

0:20:42.950,0:20:44.530
Wayne: He loves stealing lion toys.

0:20:44.530,0:20:45.530
Baaulp: What?

0:20:45.530,0:20:47.120
Gir: He loves turning old and stealing.

0:20:47.120,0:20:48.120
Wayne: Go.

0:20:48.120,0:20:53.970
Baaulp: No, he told me about this couple who
are VERY well off, and he's like, they're

0:20:53.970,0:21:00.230
very well off because they just chit-chatted,
and the guy's like a lawyer or something.

0:21:00.230,0:21:06.370
Clearly doesn't need to steal, but still tries
to steal meat from the meat department at

0:21:06.370,0:21:11.710
the grocery store he works at. And he assumes
that they do it for the thrill of it, because—

0:21:11.710,0:21:12.710
Trog: Yeah.

0:21:12.710,0:21:15.400
Wayne: No, that's why they're well off. They
steal their meat, they don't have to pay for

0:21:15.400,0:21:16.400
it.

0:21:16.400,0:21:17.400
Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

0:21:17.400,0:21:21.440
Trog: Meat makes up 80% of the average American
spenditures, annually, so—

0:21:21.440,0:21:24.440
Baaulp: Help me balance my budget, please.

0:21:24.440,0:21:28.309
Gir: That's how he's frugal, he doesn't buy
his meat, [crosstalk] he fucking steals it.

0:21:28.309,0:21:29.460
Wayne: 70k a year on meat.

0:21:29.460,0:21:35.309
Trog: I have a question for everybody, and
y'know, considering the idea of statue of

0:21:35.309,0:21:39.590
limitations and anything, have you ever stolen
anything from a store?

0:21:39.590,0:21:40.659
Wayne: [crosstalk] Absolutely.

0:21:40.659,0:21:41.659
Gir: Absolutely.

0:21:41.659,0:21:42.659
Trog: Wow.

0:21:42.659,0:21:43.659
Log: Not a store.

0:21:43.659,0:21:44.919
Wayne: Not a store?

0:21:44.919,0:21:49.690
Trog: 100%, I cannot think of anything I've
ever stolen, you all are psychopaths.

0:21:49.690,0:21:51.549
Wayne: I was a fucking, okay—

0:21:51.549,0:21:53.490
Gir: I haven't stolen since I was a child.

0:21:53.490,0:21:57.929
Wayne: I wasn't stealing video games, I wasn't
stealing large food items, [crosstalk] me

0:21:57.929,0:21:59.020
and my friends when we were in—

0:21:59.020,0:22:00.020
Trog: You were stealing diamonds.

0:22:00.020,0:22:02.600
Wayne: Me and my friends when we were in middle
school and high school, we were just little

0:22:02.600,0:22:05.440
fuckin' assholes, [crosstalk] we really were—

0:22:05.440,0:22:06.440
Baaulp: You guys were bad boys!

0:22:06.440,0:22:07.440
Gir: Punk ass motherfuckers.

0:22:07.440,0:22:10.190
Wayne: We would go to this shitty grocery
store where none of the workers cared about

0:22:10.190,0:22:11.190
anything—

0:22:11.190,0:22:12.190
Gir: So just all grocery store workers.

0:22:12.190,0:22:13.600
Wayne: We would just open boxes of Oreos and
eat them—

0:22:13.600,0:22:16.289
Gir: Oh, you're that little fucker I hate!

0:22:16.289,0:22:20.140
Baaulp: [crosstalk] You guys are fuckin' bad
boys!

0:22:20.140,0:22:23.970
Wayne: We used to take Hubba Bubba and chew
it up, [crosstalk] and then put it back on

0:22:23.970,0:22:24.970
the shelves.

0:22:24.970,0:22:25.970
Trog: And spit it on the ground.

0:22:25.970,0:22:26.970
Gir: Oh, you motherfucker.

0:22:26.970,0:22:27.970
Wayne: No, no no no no, we didn't do that.

0:22:27.970,0:22:28.970
Trog: [crosstalk] Put it back in the container.

0:22:28.970,0:22:30.130
Gir: I would've kicked your punk ass.

0:22:30.130,0:22:35.309
Wayne: We did take gum, but we didn't do that.
I did, on two or three occasions, we opened

0:22:35.309,0:22:37.650
an Oreo or a Chips Ahoy, and we had a few
and put it back.

0:22:37.650,0:22:39.200
Gir: I hate you.

0:22:39.200,0:22:41.600
Wayne: Which, in retrospect, yes. That was
awful.

0:22:41.600,0:22:42.600
Log: Put you in a hole.

0:22:42.600,0:22:45.490
Wayne: That was really bad, especially for
the poor woman that would buy those for their

0:22:45.490,0:22:46.490
child.

0:22:46.490,0:22:51.151
Gir: Probably some old grandma was like, "I
got you some Chips Ahoy!" and the kids like

0:22:51.151,0:22:53.070
"Grandma, there's no fucking cookies in here!"

0:22:53.070,0:22:54.720
Trog: "It's full of chewed gum!"

0:22:54.720,0:22:56.930
Baaulp: [crosstalk] "Oh no, I'm gonna cry
now!"

0:22:56.930,0:22:57.930
Wayne: There was a deli—

0:22:57.930,0:22:59.120
Gir: "You gonna cry now, you little bitch?"

0:22:59.120,0:23:04.430
Log: Well now, hold on, though. You're taking
the cookies out of the bags and eating them,

0:23:04.430,0:23:10.870
and then putting them back, but who's gonna
get tricked by your [crosstalk] shitty cookie

0:23:10.870,0:23:11.870
mess?

0:23:11.870,0:23:12.870
Wayne: It wasn't a prank, we were just hungry!

0:23:12.870,0:23:15.080
Log: Yeah, I'm saying, [crosstalk] who's gonna—

0:23:15.080,0:23:16.779
Gir: Old people! Old people!

0:23:16.779,0:23:19.390
Log: Nobody's gonna buy it, you're not gonna
get fooled!

0:23:19.390,0:23:20.390
Wayne: That's not the point!

0:23:20.390,0:23:26.059
Log: It's not like Wayne was a little 7 year
old carrying around a heat sealer, "Oh, I'll

0:23:26.059,0:23:27.480
just reseal the bag!"

0:23:27.480,0:23:29.430
Gir: You realize that those things look fine.

0:23:29.430,0:23:33.440
Wayne: Oreos and Chips Ahoy have that special
system where you open it from the top, and

0:23:33.440,0:23:34.970
then you put it back, and it reseals itself.

0:23:34.970,0:23:35.970
Trog: Yeah, you open up the top.

0:23:35.970,0:23:38.419
Gir: Yeah, that special system where there's
glue on it.

0:23:38.419,0:23:41.029
Trog: Yeah, the secret cookie glue.

0:23:41.029,0:23:42.381
Log: They didn't have that back then!

0:23:42.381,0:23:43.381
Gir: Yeah, they did.

0:23:43.381,0:23:44.381
Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, they didn't have
that back then.

0:23:44.381,0:23:45.381
Log: They definitely didn't.

0:23:45.381,0:23:46.381
Trog: Yeah, they did.

0:23:46.381,0:23:47.980
Wayne: They absolutely did! This was when
I was in high school and middle school, [crosstalk]

0:23:47.980,0:23:48.980
they absolutely did!

0:23:48.980,0:23:50.570
Gir: So 5 or 6 years...

0:23:50.570,0:23:54.279
Log: You were in high school!? I assumed you
were 7!

0:23:54.279,0:23:56.809
Trog: If he was 7, how would he get to the
store!?

0:23:56.809,0:23:58.130
Log: [crosstalk] He would walk, I dunno!

0:23:58.130,0:23:59.429
Gir: His mom took him.

0:23:59.429,0:24:04.230
Wayne: We just didn't give a shit! Okay, and
here's our logic, we only did this at this

0:24:04.230,0:24:09.080
one really shitty grocery store where the
managers were assholes, and all the workers

0:24:09.080,0:24:13.919
didn't give half a shit, so like, no harm
done! And also, I regret this. That's the

0:24:13.919,0:24:15.710
other thing. [crosstalk] No harm done, I regret
this!

0:24:15.710,0:24:17.070
Trog: Just thought I should throw that part
in, pretty important.

0:24:17.070,0:24:20.880
Wayne: Well, 'cause I shouldn't have been
stealing, [crosstalk] because I was just an

0:24:20.880,0:24:21.880
asshole teenager!

0:24:21.880,0:24:22.880
Trog: In case the FBI is listening.

0:24:22.880,0:24:23.880
Gir: Here's the thing, is I stole when I was
a child—

0:24:23.880,0:24:24.880
Wayne: I'm sorry, FBI!

0:24:24.880,0:24:28.299
Gir: I stole when I was a child, but I just
stole a video game cheat magazine.

0:24:28.299,0:24:29.340
Wayne: That's even— that's so much worse.

0:24:29.340,0:24:30.920
Gir: So it was like 7— yeah, okay.

0:24:30.920,0:24:31.920
Baaulp: What game was it for?

0:24:31.920,0:24:32.920
Wayne: [crosstalk] James—

0:24:32.920,0:24:34.159
Gir: It was for all games, it was a 7 dollar,
[crosstalk] here's all these game systems,

0:24:34.159,0:24:35.159
here's all the cheat codes for these games.

0:24:35.159,0:24:37.690
Trog: Oh, yeah, I've had one of those before.
Back before the internet, yeah.

0:24:37.690,0:24:42.260
Wayne: ALL games? Oh my god. You stole the
magazine with cheat codes for ALL games EVER?

0:24:42.260,0:24:43.260
Gir: Yeah.

0:24:43.260,0:24:44.260
Wayne: That was so expensive.

0:24:44.260,0:24:45.260
Gir: It was pretty epic.

0:24:45.260,0:24:46.260
Wayne: That was like a 300 dollar magazine.

0:24:46.260,0:24:48.340
Baaulp: He just said it was 7 dollars!

0:24:48.340,0:24:52.320
Gir: It was 7 dollars. I went there, [crosstalk]
okay—

0:24:52.320,0:24:54.610
Wayne: Here's why you should regret your actions.

0:24:54.610,0:24:56.580
Gir: I do! Actually, I don't.

0:24:56.580,0:25:00.929
Wayne: James. James, 8 years old. Couldn't
beat Finding Nemo. Needed the infinite lives

0:25:00.929,0:25:01.929
cheat. [crosstalk] You took the last one.

0:25:01.929,0:25:02.929
[25:00]

0:25:02.929,0:25:03.929
Gir: There was another copy, I didn't take
the only one.

0:25:03.929,0:25:06.210
Wayne: Well no, you took that one, and then
someone else took the other one.

0:25:06.210,0:25:08.070
Gir: Well, that's his fucking problem, [crosstalk]
he should've got there sooner.

0:25:08.070,0:25:09.669
Wayne: He never beat Finding Nemo!

0:25:09.669,0:25:12.179
Gir: Nobody likes Finding Nemo, that game
sucked!

0:25:12.179,0:25:15.740
Wayne: I'm using Finding Nemo on the GameCube,
because I remember I had a cheat code book,

0:25:15.740,0:25:17.789
and that was one of the first things in it
for some reason.

0:25:17.789,0:25:20.960
Gir: I had Finding Nemo on the GameCube, and
that game was a pile of shit.

0:25:20.960,0:25:22.660
Trog: Yeah, that game was really bad.

0:25:22.660,0:25:24.380
Gir: It was so fucking bad.

0:25:24.380,0:25:27.559
Wayne: Games not having cheat codes where
it's just pressing a sequence of buttons at

0:25:27.559,0:25:29.110
the main menu anymore is a fucking tragedy.

0:25:29.110,0:25:30.770
Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, they need to bring
that back.

0:25:30.770,0:25:31.770
Gir: Yeah, it's a travesty.

0:25:31.770,0:25:32.770
Baaulp: Well, that's DLC now!

0:25:32.770,0:25:36.279
Wayne: I know. It literally was! What was
that game that had DLC where it was like,

0:25:36.279,0:25:37.659
"Oh, cheat code DLC!", [crosstalk] and it—

0:25:37.659,0:25:38.860
Gir: Saints Row.

0:25:38.860,0:25:40.361
Wayne: [crosstalk] Was that Saints Row?

0:25:40.361,0:25:41.361
Trog: Was that Saints Row?

0:25:41.361,0:25:42.361
Log: Dead Rising, I think.

0:25:42.361,0:25:43.361
Wayne: That was some bullshit. Yeah, Dead
Rising as well.

0:25:43.361,0:25:44.361
Trog: What the hell, really?

0:25:44.361,0:25:45.361
Gir: Still bought it.

0:25:45.361,0:25:46.361
Wayne: Dead Rising and Saints Row both had
that.

0:25:46.361,0:25:47.361
Trog: I did not know that.

0:25:47.361,0:25:54.020
Baaulp: I am a good boy, I did not steal,
but I will say this. I just remembered this,

0:25:54.020,0:26:01.160
I might be a good boy, but I might've been
a dark boy, because I did not steal, but man—

0:26:01.160,0:26:02.270
Gir: Did I murder!

0:26:02.270,0:26:09.920
Baaulp: This one time I pulled some, like,
on the verge of almost being a little psychopath.

0:26:09.920,0:26:13.610
Because I was playing in the park, it was
just me and my parents, they took me to the

0:26:13.610,0:26:14.610
park—

0:26:14.610,0:26:15.610
Gir: ??? and killed a kid!

0:26:15.610,0:26:22.340
Baaulp: There was a family there that looked
much more well off than me, and the concept

0:26:22.340,0:26:30.380
of pen pals was just introduced to me. This
was back before most people— or, a lot of

0:26:30.380,0:26:36.140
people had internet, so if you wanted to talk
to someone you either called them or sent

0:26:36.140,0:26:40.790
them an old-fashioned letter. And I was like,
"I know what a pen pal is, I know what to

0:26:40.790,0:26:48.220
do!" Fast forward, this kids parents are buying
me McDonald's because they think I'll be this

0:26:48.220,0:26:53.460
kids pen pal, [crosstalk] and I'm pretty sure
they gave me their address and the kids name,

0:26:53.460,0:26:55.050
and I threw the paper away later.

0:26:55.050,0:26:56.050
Trog: What the fuck?

0:26:56.050,0:26:57.050
Wayne: What?

0:26:57.050,0:26:58.050
Trog: What?

0:26:58.050,0:26:59.050
Gir: Nice.

0:26:59.050,0:27:00.050
Wayne: I don't understand this story, [crosstalk]
I don't understand why your—

0:27:00.050,0:27:02.490
Gir: That's more a fault of the parents than
you.

0:27:02.490,0:27:04.399
Wayne: I don't get this at all.

0:27:04.399,0:27:07.420
Baaulp: I manipulated them into getting me
free food.

0:27:07.420,0:27:11.474
Wayne: Yes, but why did they buy you McDonald's
because you were the kids pen pal? A pen pal

0:27:11.474,0:27:12.590
is just—

0:27:12.590,0:27:19.179
Baaulp: Because they thought that kid was
gonna get a— okay. I talked to them, I remembered

0:27:19.179,0:27:25.190
them being from out of the city, and they
thought their kid was gonna get a cool Asian

0:27:25.190,0:27:31.810
pen pal friend, and become more worldly, and
I took advantage of their hospitality and

0:27:31.810,0:27:34.409
their hope, and I threw that paper in the
fucking trash when they weren't looking.

0:27:34.409,0:27:36.670
Gir: [crosstalk] That's more taking advantage
of them being dumb.

0:27:36.670,0:27:38.039
Trog: Honestly, I really like that story.

0:27:38.039,0:27:39.039
Wayne: [crosstalk] It's really good.

0:27:39.039,0:27:42.799
Trog: That reminds me of something really
fucking dumb me and my friends used to do

0:27:42.799,0:27:49.820
as small-ish children, probably like, y'know,
8 to 10 years old. We used to just ride our

0:27:49.820,0:27:56.260
bikes and wait for a car to drive by, and
then pretend to crash and see if we could

0:27:56.260,0:27:58.900
get them to stop and ask if we were alright.

0:27:58.900,0:28:00.290
Gir: [crosstalk] That's pretty good.

0:28:00.290,0:28:06.179
Trog: Looking back on it now, I can't fathom
why we thought this would be interesting,

0:28:06.179,0:28:11.169
but for some reason, it was like, if we could
pretend to crash on our bikes good enough

0:28:11.169,0:28:16.160
to get a car to stop and be like "Hey, are
you okay?", then it was great.

0:28:16.160,0:28:19.710
Wayne: Trog, you were doing insurance fraud
as a child.

0:28:19.710,0:28:22.659
Trog: Yeah. [crosstalk] Well no, because we
weren't running into the cars.

0:28:22.659,0:28:23.950
Gir: They weren't running into the cars!

0:28:23.950,0:28:26.710
Baaulp: No, they weren't crashing into the
car, they were crashing into each other!

0:28:26.710,0:28:28.090
Trog: We weren't running into each other!

0:28:28.090,0:28:30.960
Wayne: Have you seen those insurance fraud
videos, though?

0:28:30.960,0:28:31.960
Gir: Yeah.

0:28:31.960,0:28:34.410
Wayne: You don't need to touch the car, you
can just fall over near it and expect money

0:28:34.410,0:28:35.410
from them.

0:28:35.410,0:28:39.460
Trog: All we were doing, we were riding our
bikes, and then we'd just fall to the side

0:28:39.460,0:28:44.630
onto grass. And thinking back on it now, I
realize how fucked up that is, because whenever

0:28:44.630,0:28:51.049
I'm driving and I see any child on the sidewalk,
I'm in full-on panic mode, because I'm like,

0:28:51.049,0:28:56.110
"Kids are fucking dumb. If he decides to run
into the street and I can't stop my car fast

0:28:56.110,0:28:57.950
enough, my life is over."

0:28:57.950,0:29:02.200
Wayne: I have nightmares about that shit.
But what I was gonna say, did any cars ever

0:29:02.200,0:29:03.200
stop?

0:29:03.200,0:29:04.200
Trog: I think like, one, ever.

0:29:04.200,0:29:06.270
Wayne: And what happened?

0:29:06.270,0:29:11.559
Trog: What do you think happened? They stopped,
they said "Hey, are you okay?", and I was

0:29:11.559,0:29:15.920
like "Nah, I'm good." and they're like "Okay."
and they drive away!

0:29:15.920,0:29:20.730
Wayne: There's another outcome to that, though.
They could've been pissed! They could've been

0:29:20.730,0:29:22.270
fucking furious at you!

0:29:22.270,0:29:25.210
Gir: "Why are you kids hurtin' yourselves,
you little fucks?"

0:29:25.210,0:29:29.100
Wayne: Like Rocco— Like fuckin' Mega64,
Rocco Botte, he told a story at some point

0:29:29.100,0:29:32.590
about when he was a kid, he used to take toy
M16's and shoot at cars with them.

0:29:32.590,0:29:34.460
Trog: [crosstalk] Oh god. That's different,
that's way different.

0:29:34.460,0:29:35.700
Gir: That's so, so fucking reckless.

0:29:35.700,0:29:39.750
Wayne: Well yes, and he's also from a different
generation than us, where that was [crosstalk]

0:29:39.750,0:29:41.669
those kinds of toys were more—

0:29:41.669,0:29:42.669
Gir: Not acceptable, ever.

0:29:42.669,0:29:44.960
Wayne: Well yeah, [crosstalk] but more realistic
gun toys were available.

0:29:44.960,0:29:46.260
Trog: But won't land you in jail.

0:29:46.260,0:29:48.070
Wayne: Well he was a child, he was like 8.

0:29:48.070,0:29:49.909
Gir: [crosstalk] Kid jail.

0:29:49.909,0:29:54.340
Wayne: Talking about doing shitty stuff near
roads as a kid, like crashing your bikes.

0:29:54.340,0:29:58.929
When I was in like sixth grade, I did something
that could've gotten someone killed, and I

0:29:58.929,0:30:00.250
have no clue why I did it.

0:30:00.250,0:30:01.250
[30:00]

0:30:01.250,0:30:05.832
Wayne: I took a big ass rock, like a rock
maybe the size of a basketball and a half,

0:30:05.832,0:30:06.832
[crosstalk] I just put it in the middle of
the road.

0:30:06.832,0:30:07.832
Gir: What the fuck?

0:30:07.832,0:30:08.832
Trog: What the hell?

0:30:08.832,0:30:11.960
Gir: Oh, I thought you were gonna say you
threw it at a car [crosstalk] as it was passing.

0:30:11.960,0:30:12.960
Trog: Threw it at somebody!

0:30:12.960,0:30:16.500
Wayne: Oh, no! No, I put it in the middle
of the road, which is arguably more dangerous.

0:30:16.500,0:30:17.500
Trog: Yeah.

0:30:17.500,0:30:22.170
Gir: Okay, 'cause when I was 8, that's what
I did, was we took pebbles, and we'd throw

0:30:22.170,0:30:23.350
'em as cars were going by.

0:30:23.350,0:30:24.350
Wayne: Oh my god.

0:30:24.350,0:30:25.960
Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, I was a little shithead.

0:30:25.960,0:30:26.960
Trog: That's not bad. That's not unusual.

0:30:26.960,0:30:28.170
Gir: [crosstalk] It wasn't bad until I learned—

0:30:28.170,0:30:31.250
Wayne: It's not bad, but I just imagine it
actually happening, [crosstalk] where you

0:30:31.250,0:30:32.250
ding a car and fuck it up.

0:30:32.250,0:30:36.240
Gir: Yeah, no, that's what happened is one
day I finally discovered the concept of leading

0:30:36.240,0:30:40.580
your shot, and I hit a car, and they immediately
hit their fucking brakes, and I RAN.

0:30:40.580,0:30:42.630
Wayne: Hold on, how old were you?

0:30:42.630,0:30:43.630
Gir: Like 8.

0:30:43.630,0:30:44.630
Baaulp: 18.

0:30:44.630,0:30:46.690
Wayne: And you didn't understand— 18...

0:30:46.690,0:30:48.149
Trog: I was 22!

0:30:48.149,0:30:49.279
Gir: [crosstalk] 7 or 8.

0:30:49.279,0:30:52.779
Wayne: When I was 22, I found out the concept
of leading my shot! [crosstalk] That's what

0:30:52.779,0:30:53.779
I was laughing at.

0:30:53.779,0:30:54.779
Gir: Yeah, it was like 7 or 8.

0:30:54.779,0:30:58.559
Wayne: I feel like even when I was a kid,
I found out— I would know that you wouldn't

0:30:58.559,0:31:01.090
throw at it the moment you saw the car in
front of you.

0:31:01.090,0:31:05.600
Gir: Well, you had video games. We couldn't
afford video games, so I threw rocks at cars.

0:31:05.600,0:31:07.870
Wayne: That's not a thing that video games
have to teach you!

0:31:07.870,0:31:08.870
Gir: Yes it is.

0:31:08.870,0:31:09.870
Wayne: [crosstalk] Did you ever play catch?

0:31:09.870,0:31:10.870
Baaulp: Did you ever throw a ball?

0:31:10.870,0:31:11.870
Gir: No.

0:31:11.870,0:31:12.870
Wayne: Did you ever play catch with a moving
target?

0:31:12.870,0:31:15.880
Gir: No. [crosstalk] My targets all stood
still.

0:31:15.880,0:31:18.740
Trog: This just reminds me of the scene from
The Good Son where Home Alone throws a dummy—

0:31:18.740,0:31:22.029
Baaulp: Wait, sorry, I have to interrupt you.
You said everything was still, like no one

0:31:22.029,0:31:23.029
moved—

0:31:23.029,0:31:24.029
Gir: Yeah.

0:31:24.029,0:31:25.029
Baaulp: You ever played basketball?

0:31:25.029,0:31:26.029
Trog: No.

0:31:26.029,0:31:27.029
Gir: No.

0:31:27.029,0:31:29.580
Baaulp: Everyone just stands still?

0:31:29.580,0:31:32.710
Gir: When I was 8, no, I had not played basketball.

0:31:32.710,0:31:36.279
Wayne: And no one had run before. [crosstalk]
None of my friends had moved.

0:31:36.279,0:31:37.279
Gir: Nobody had ever.

0:31:37.279,0:31:39.149
Log: We're gonna put Gir and Wayne away.

0:31:39.149,0:31:41.169
Gir: I don't wanna go away.

0:31:41.169,0:31:42.169
Trog: Forever.

0:31:42.169,0:31:43.169
Wayne: Why?

0:31:43.169,0:31:44.200
Log: You've done too much.

0:31:44.200,0:31:47.460
Trog: Yeah, you guys, [crosstalk] this is
actually a sting operation.

0:31:47.460,0:31:48.500
Log: The proof has been given.

0:31:48.500,0:31:51.789
Wayne: I have another story about how I slashed
a cars tires.

0:31:51.789,0:31:53.269
Trog: Woah, what the fuck?

0:31:53.269,0:31:55.880
Gir: [crosstalk] I have another story about
how my friend almost burned his house down.

0:31:55.880,0:31:59.370
Wayne: No, I'm making jokes about crime, it
didn't actually happen.

0:31:59.370,0:32:00.370
Trog: Crime jokes.

0:32:00.370,0:32:07.220
Log: Yeah, y'know— man, I gotta talk shit
about something that I remember from years

0:32:07.220,0:32:12.970
ago. Y'know how they got fuckin' blogs out
there that are all about roleplaying as a

0:32:12.970,0:32:13.970
shoplifter?

0:32:13.970,0:32:14.970
Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah.

0:32:14.970,0:32:15.970
Wayne: Yes.

0:32:15.970,0:32:16.970
Trog: Yeah.

0:32:16.970,0:32:17.970
Baaulp: Oh yeah, yep.

0:32:17.970,0:32:23.130
Log: It makes me— it confuses me that somebody
would roleplay as a shoplifter to begin with,

0:32:23.130,0:32:28.220
'cause there's no thrill to it if you're not
actually doing it, right? [crosstalk] Like,

0:32:28.220,0:32:29.220
what's the point?

0:32:29.220,0:32:33.169
Baaulp: Well, the thrill comes from making
people online THINK you're a shoplifter, I

0:32:33.169,0:32:34.169
guess.

0:32:34.169,0:32:38.809
Log: But also the second thing that makes
me mad at it, is that they call it "lifting".

0:32:38.809,0:32:43.940
And all of their titles are like, "Lifting
Master" and "Lifting Queen" and stuff.

0:32:43.940,0:32:48.210
Wayne: Well that's 'cause they don't want
it to be like, actually— people think that

0:32:48.210,0:32:49.210
they're doing illegal shit.

0:32:49.210,0:32:54.020
Log: "Ey, I lifted two lobsters from the grocery
store today!" [crosstalk] "Lifting King!"

0:32:54.020,0:32:57.490
Wayne: It's like, "Alright, I'm gonna roleplay
as a murderer, what do I call it?" [crosstalk]

0:32:57.490,0:32:58.860
"Ah shit, I can't say that I'm murdering people
on my blog!"

0:32:58.860,0:32:59.909
Gir: "Did some murd' today."

0:32:59.909,0:33:03.250
Wayne: "I did some— I durged somebody today."

0:33:03.250,0:33:05.620
Log: "I did some slang today."

0:33:05.620,0:33:12.590

and I'm gonna show you how to get 99 Runecrafting

0:33:12.590,0:33:14.019
in 4 months."

0:33:14.019,0:33:16.399
Wayne: Alright, what's step one?

0:33:16.399,0:33:22.440
Trog: Quit your job, number one. Number two,
sell all your worldly possessions except for

0:33:22.440,0:33:26.190
a computer and an internet connection, and
never sleep.

0:33:26.190,0:33:28.000
Wayne: Leave enough money to fund food for
a year.

0:33:28.000,0:33:29.000
Trog: You don't need food.

0:33:29.000,0:33:30.880
Baaulp: Only lasagna, and water, and bread.

go ahead and give me your login information.

Wayne: I can verify that you have 99 Runecrafting,
[crosstalk] you won't know.

0:33:40.460,0:33:45.049
Trog: Only I can get 99 Runecrafting, you
have to give your account to me [crosstalk]

0:33:45.049,0:33:46.049
and I will unlock it.

0:33:46.049,0:33:47.049
Gir: You can only make it to 98.

0:33:47.049,0:33:51.409
Wayne: That last level, 98 to 99, is impossible.
Once you hit 98, I need your info.

0:33:51.409,0:33:52.429
Gir: [crosstalk] But I know a guy.

0:33:52.429,0:33:54.169
Wayne: But I also need your credit card number
to fund membership.

0:33:54.169,0:33:55.169
Gir: I know a guy who can do it.

0:33:55.169,0:33:58.740
Trog: Talking about crime and shit, I've never
stolen anything, but I've definitely tried

0:33:58.740,0:34:02.720
to scam people on RuneScape when I was like
7, is that the same?

0:34:02.720,0:34:03.720
Gir: No.

0:34:03.720,0:34:05.380
Baaulp: Yeah. Yes, that's even worse.

0:34:05.380,0:34:08.589
Trog: Not 7, I guess I was like 10.

0:34:08.589,0:34:14.040
Wayne: I scammed people all the time on Maplestory.
Maplestory used to have one of the dumbest

0:34:14.040,0:34:18.150
things ever, which was fame, and fame was
just like, once a day, you could click an

0:34:18.150,0:34:22.200
arrow on someone's profile, and it would make
a number go up for fame. And for some reason,

0:34:22.200,0:34:27.570
people would just buy it for 20k, 'cause I
think certain armor types, you needed Fame

0:34:27.570,0:34:33.089
to wear it. Which is ridiculously dumb. So
yeah, you would just say, like, "Oh, selling

0:34:33.089,0:34:37.579
Fame, 15k." and get someone to give you 15k
and then [crosstalk] not upvote.

0:34:37.579,0:34:38.960
Trog: Not do it.

0:34:38.960,0:34:42.820
Baaulp: Yeah, there's no way to verify it.
Also, I distinctly remember passing by one

0:34:42.820,0:34:49.550
person in an area where we were the only two
people there, and we were literally just walking

0:34:49.550,0:34:54.929
opposite directions, and just to be cheeky
I clicked the down arrow. They noticed, and

0:34:54.929,0:34:58.349
they immediately started following me [crosstalk]
and yelling at me.

0:34:58.349,0:35:00.500
Wayne: How did they notice? Did they have
their profile open?

0:35:00.500,0:35:01.500
[35:00]

0:35:01.500,0:35:02.690
Log: It tells you whenever you get defamed.

0:35:02.690,0:35:07.160
Wayne: Oh yeah, it does, it does. It did,
at least.

0:35:07.160,0:35:12.510
Log: That was a really poorly thought out
decision on their part. Maybe it's different

0:35:12.510,0:35:20.780
in Korea, but here in the Wild Wild West,
you were just hunting in that fucking Ludibrium

0:35:20.780,0:35:28.089
Party Quest entrance for people with exactly
20 fame and the 20 fame requirement gear on,

0:35:28.089,0:35:30.270
so you can just fucking obliterate them instantly.

0:35:30.270,0:35:32.360
Gir: I never played RuneScape, so—

0:35:32.360,0:35:35.500
Wayne: Wait, wait, wait, wait, really, was
that a—

0:35:35.500,0:35:37.580
Log: Yeah, you didn't played RuneScape?

0:35:37.580,0:35:39.660
Trog: That was Maplestory, but—

0:35:39.660,0:35:41.210
Gir: It's the same thing to me.

0:35:41.210,0:35:45.750
Wayne: Log, I need you to elaborate a little
bit. So you would bring them into the Party

0:35:45.750,0:35:48.930
Quest and defame them so that their armor
would come off?

0:35:48.930,0:35:54.560
Log: No, like the entrances, right? You got
the Lubridium Party Quest, or the Monster

0:35:54.560,0:35:55.650
Carnival, or whatever, right?

0:35:55.650,0:35:57.010
Wayne: Uh huh. Yeah, yeah.

0:35:57.010,0:36:01.880
Log: There's just huge hordes of people in
front of the entrance to the zone that everyone

0:36:01.880,0:36:10.130
went to. You just click on a guy, "Oh, what's
that? Got 20 fame?" [crosstalk] "You've got

0:36:10.130,0:36:11.560
the Shadow gear?"

0:36:11.560,0:36:13.500
Wayne: It would make their clothes eject,
literally?

0:36:13.500,0:36:17.340
Log: Yeah, you'd just hit that button and
go, "YEAH! YEAH! YES!"

0:36:17.340,0:36:24.780
Trog: I did not know that that was a system—
tying armor to something that other players

0:36:24.780,0:36:27.270
can affect, that's wild!

0:36:27.270,0:36:32.960
Log: Yeah, that's why automated reporting
systems are a bad idea, Blizzard and DotA

0:36:32.960,0:36:39.250
2 and all them. Yeah, you think that people
won't abuse that? People always go, "Oh, I

0:36:39.250,0:36:45.670
bet you were doin' something bad if you got
banned." But man, if you were a kid and you

0:36:45.670,0:36:50.070
played Maplestory, you know what its like
to just be able to destroy somebody with the

0:36:50.070,0:36:56.230
click of a button. And you won't be responsible.
That's just a fact.

0:36:56.230,0:37:01.630
Trog: Yeah, exactly. It's not a victimless
crime, it's a— you'll never get caught.

0:37:01.630,0:37:08.940
Log: Also, I wanna talk about that... I guess
more visible example of the modern age, that

0:37:08.940,0:37:11.530
Rainbow 6 Siege instant ban filter.

0:37:11.530,0:37:13.180
Trog: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, that's great.

0:37:13.180,0:37:15.010
Wayne: That's what I was gonna bring up.

0:37:15.010,0:37:20.030
Log: Just tricking people into saying the
wrong words until they lose. [crosstalk] You

0:37:20.030,0:37:25.089
just get a free win in ranked because you
tell somebody to spell "grabbing" backwards,

0:37:25.089,0:37:26.089
or something.

0:37:26.089,0:37:27.350
Trog: You just bait racism!

0:37:27.350,0:37:29.690
Wayne: Wait, spell "grabbing" backwards? What
is that?

0:37:29.690,0:37:34.760
Log: Yeah, because if you spell it backwards,
it trips off some meme swear.

0:37:34.760,0:37:37.060
Wayne: Oh, with the double B?

0:37:37.060,0:37:38.060
Log: [crosstalk] Yeah.

0:37:38.060,0:37:39.060
Trog: Yeah.

0:37:39.060,0:37:40.060
Log: And it will ban you.

0:37:40.060,0:37:44.130
Trog: I will say, though, I don't know if
that's a good or a bad thing, but I wish every

0:37:44.130,0:37:48.040
video game I played would just ban someone
instantly for saying a racial slur.

0:37:48.040,0:37:51.520
Wayne: Oh absolutely. That's a good thing,
why would you not want that in any game? I

0:37:51.520,0:37:53.670
think Siege is like, the best game ever for
adding that.

0:37:53.670,0:38:01.030
Log: It's not good if you take the game seriously,
because if Tanner the 12 year old boy gets—

0:38:01.030,0:38:06.350
[crosstalk] on your team, gets tricked into
saying a word—

0:38:06.350,0:38:08.160
Trog: Gets baited. Gets racism baited.

0:38:08.160,0:38:12.670
Log: Yeah, gets tricked into being racist,
then you're just down a player and you lose!

0:38:12.670,0:38:17.910
Wayne: I think, for me, the pleasure of seeing
that person endure that punishment is good

0:38:17.910,0:38:21.180
enough, [crosstalk] I think I would care about
that more than winning the game.

0:38:21.180,0:38:22.180
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:38:22.180,0:38:25.010
Trog: No, it's the difference between— like,
yes, if somebody is saying it on purpose,

0:38:25.010,0:38:28.050
but Log is describing a young person, not,
like—

0:38:28.050,0:38:30.119
Wayne: Oh, being tricked into doing it?

0:38:30.119,0:38:31.440
Trog: Yeah, literally being tricked into it.

0:38:31.440,0:38:32.470
Wayne: [crosstalk] Well, I think that's funny.

0:38:32.470,0:38:33.470
Trog: It is funny.

0:38:33.470,0:38:35.099
Log: "Hey, what's the name of Cartman's superhero
form?"

0:38:35.099,0:38:36.310
Wayne: Yeah, yeah.

0:38:36.310,0:38:41.540
Log: "How do you spell 'grabbing" backwards?"
"Hey man, I noticed that you're a Spanish

0:38:41.540,0:38:44.340
speaker, what's the name of that skin, Black
Ice?"

0:38:44.340,0:38:45.340
Wayne: Black Ice!?

0:38:45.340,0:38:47.079
Trog: I don't know what that one is.

0:38:47.079,0:38:53.810
Log: Well, it's because it's an English word
filter for a multinational game, [crosstalk]

0:38:53.810,0:38:54.810
and—

0:38:54.810,0:38:55.810
Trog: Oh.

0:38:55.810,0:38:56.810
Wayne: Yeah.

0:38:56.810,0:38:57.810
Log: You know how to say "black" in Spanish.

0:38:57.810,0:38:58.810
Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah.

0:38:58.810,0:38:59.810
Trog: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

0:38:59.810,0:39:03.700
Wayne: So, the one thing I do like about this
now, is envisioning this in a physical sense,

0:39:03.700,0:39:07.830
of like, let's say that this is a net café,
and all the people— all 10 people playing

0:39:07.830,0:39:12.320
Siege are in the same room. I just imagine
a turret on the ceiling, that someone types

0:39:12.320,0:39:14.060
one of these words, they're vaporized instantly.

0:39:14.060,0:39:18.480
Gir: I like the concept, more, that they just
go *pop* and they're gone.

0:39:18.480,0:39:19.520
Trog: Disappear.

0:39:19.520,0:39:25.800
Baaulp: I walk in, I say "Hey everybody, don't
be racist!" and it just empties.

0:39:25.800,0:39:30.010
Wayne: Okay, that's the best trigger. It's
one thing to trick a child into doing it,

0:39:30.010,0:39:34.600
but the fact that it's like— people have
just said "Don't be racist." and someone says

0:39:34.600,0:39:38.810
a racist slur in response to that? [crosstalk]
That's the best way to get someone banned.

0:39:38.810,0:39:39.810
Baaulp: Immediately gets banned.

0:39:39.810,0:39:40.810
Gir: That is a really good trick.

0:39:40.810,0:39:45.180
Log: That's pretty good, that's pretty good.
But yeah, y'know, you talk about internet

0:39:45.180,0:39:50.570
cafés, those things kinda have their own
sorta setting for that. Like, you go into

0:39:50.570,0:39:55.710
a South American arcade, or internet café,
or something, you see a KOF machine, you're

0:39:55.710,0:40:01.050
gonna see a sign that says "If you pick Omega
Rugal, somebody's gonna fight you in real

0:40:01.050,0:40:02.050
life."

0:40:02.050,0:40:03.050
[40:00]

0:40:03.050,0:40:04.050
Wayne: Hang on, is this real?

0:40:04.050,0:40:08.030
Log: I mean, that's just how it is in some
of these arcades and stuff. It's like, "Oh

0:40:08.030,0:40:12.200
yeah, I'll fuck you up if you grab me! If
you pick Omega Rugal, you're as good as dead."

0:40:12.200,0:40:16.530
Wayne: Oh, I remember hearing stories about
that! And like Street Fighter 2 and shit.

0:40:16.530,0:40:18.720
Baaulp: Yeah, arcades were freaking NUTS!

0:40:18.720,0:40:20.840
Trog: Because you're paying real money!

0:40:20.840,0:40:23.119
Baaulp: They had house rules for a lot of
arcades!

0:40:23.119,0:40:24.960
Log: [crosstalk] There's a news story—

0:40:24.960,0:40:26.720
Wayne: "Use grabs, you fuckin' pussy!"

0:40:26.720,0:40:32.941
Log: There's a news story a while back, after—
because there's an arcade in China, where

0:40:32.941,0:40:38.701
two guys were playing KOF '97, and somebody
did a wakeup super and won, and went over

0:40:38.701,0:40:40.270
and stabbed the guy who lost.

0:40:40.270,0:40:45.520
Wayne: Oh my— wait, he— he WON and then
stabbed that guy who LOST!?

0:40:45.520,0:40:46.520
Log: Yup!

0:40:46.520,0:40:51.691
Trog: Now, look. That's a mistranslation,
they were playing a Shadow Game, and when

0:40:51.691,0:40:52.691
he lost, he lost his soul.

0:40:52.691,0:40:54.410
Gir: He got sent to the Shadow Realm.

0:40:54.410,0:40:57.400
Wayne: [crosstalk] He had to drain his blood.

0:40:57.400,0:41:03.109
Baaulp: Dude, arcades— maybe arcades are
nice in Japan, but arcades in other countries

0:41:03.109,0:41:10.550
were like— you had to be ready to throw
down in game and IRL. It's one of the reasons

0:41:10.550,0:41:15.710
why I'm not into fighting games. When I was
a kid, we lived right next to an arcade. One

0:41:15.710,0:41:20.760
night, I was in bed, I was asleep. I woke
up because I heard a bang. I was like, "Oh,

0:41:20.760,0:41:26.849
it's China, it must be someone just, I dunno,
setting off fireworks for some random reason."

0:41:26.849,0:41:31.530
I wake up the next day, and my cousin who
we lived with—'cause we lived with my uncle—was

0:41:31.530,0:41:37.000
getting a stern lecture. He didn't do anything
wrong, but he was like, "Hey, you can never

0:41:37.000,0:41:41.420
go to that arcade, and you can never bring
me to that arcade ever again, because someone

0:41:41.420,0:41:43.079
got shot there last night."

0:41:43.079,0:41:44.079
Wayne: [crosstalk] Oh my god!

0:41:44.079,0:41:45.079
Trog: Jesus. What do you think he did?

0:41:45.079,0:41:49.570
Baaulp: I think he still snuck over to the
arcade and played, 'cause I think Street Fighter

0:41:49.570,0:41:56.160
2 just came out or whatever, so there's multiple
Street Fighter 2 arcade machines or something,

0:41:56.160,0:42:00.810
but he never brought me, and I never got good
at fighting games because of it.

0:42:00.810,0:42:05.990
Wayne: I think I'm going to be thinking about
that wakeup super into stab story forever.

0:42:05.990,0:42:14.140
Baaulp: I love that he was like, "Yeah, I
won! Clearly I deserve to SURVIVE IRL!"

0:42:14.140,0:42:17.820
Wayne: The fucking injury to insult of that.

0:42:17.820,0:42:18.820
Trog: Yeah.

0:42:18.820,0:42:22.140
Wayne: Just, "Yeah, I win! Now I'm going to
kill you."

0:42:22.140,0:42:23.270
Gir: [crosstalk] "I win!" *stabbing noises*

0:42:23.270,0:42:26.890
Trog: Well, not kill, you can be stabbed in
a lot of different places, and they don't

0:42:26.890,0:42:27.890
all end fatally.

0:42:27.890,0:42:32.480
Log: Yeah, good ending to the story, I'm pretty
sure the guy that got stabbed survived, and

0:42:32.480,0:42:33.930
the both of them are friends.

0:42:33.930,0:42:36.040
Trog: Alright, well, [crosstalk] sometimes
you just gotta—

0:42:36.040,0:42:37.040
Gir: What? That's an even stranger twist.

0:42:37.040,0:42:41.349
Trog: Hey, hey, hey. I'll be honest, whenever
I was big into Tekken 7, if I was in the same

0:42:41.349,0:42:45.859
room as you guys while I was playing that
game, I probably would've stabbed you too.

0:42:45.859,0:42:47.220
Fuck Tekken.

0:42:47.220,0:42:53.940
Wayne: You were talking about stabbing them
in nonfatal places, and now I'm imagining

0:42:53.940,0:42:58.060
he wins, and he's so excited, he doesn't go
and stab him in the chest like a violent attack,

0:42:58.060,0:43:03.579
he just goes like, "Yeah, alright!", and then
he just stabs him in his pinky toe. Just something

0:43:03.579,0:43:05.350
very nonpermanent.

0:43:05.350,0:43:10.200
Gir: He pulls his knife out and he's like,
"Where is this NOT going to kill you?"

0:43:10.200,0:43:12.540
Wayne: [crosstalk] I just wanna hurt you a
little bit.

0:43:12.540,0:43:16.770
Trog: Well, you didn't read the whole story,
he actually— his left hand was just a sword,

0:43:16.770,0:43:19.619
and he tried to give him a high five. He tried
to shake his hand, say good game.

0:43:19.619,0:43:20.619
Gir: [crosstalk] GG, dude.

0:43:20.619,0:43:25.530
Wayne: Yeah, and he stabbed. [crosstalk] He
did a stabbing motion for his high five, for

0:43:25.530,0:43:27.550
some reason.

0:43:27.550,0:43:29.559
Trog: Yeah.

0:43:29.559,0:43:38.640
[intermission music “Sento Gakuen” from
Cutey Honey OST plays (43:24-43:38)]

0:43:38.640,0:43:44.940
Baaulp: Yeah, we learned a lot. We learned
a lot about Dragon Ball Super, about bugs,

0:43:44.940,0:43:48.570
about CRIME! We're all criminals, apparently.
[crosstalk] All child crimes.

0:43:48.570,0:43:49.600
Wayne: We learned about my criminal history.

[45:00]

0:44:59.150,0:45:02.730
Trog: So this first question is from MysteryDruids,
and I really like this question 'cause it

0:45:02.730,0:45:08.031
really resonates with me personally, I'm curious
to hear what you guys have to say. But he

0:45:08.031,0:45:13.940
asks, "What's the game from your childhood
you went back and played as an adult, and

0:45:13.940,0:45:16.500
realized you had terrible taste in games as
a child?"

0:45:16.500,0:45:17.500
Gir: 40 Winks.

0:45:17.500,0:45:18.500
Trog: [crosstalk] What is that?

0:45:18.500,0:45:19.500
Wayne: The flash game from nick.com?

0:45:19.500,0:45:20.500
Gir: No, PlayStation game. Look it up.

0:45:20.500,0:45:21.926
Wayne: I dunno what that is, [crosstalk] tell
me about it.

0:45:21.926,0:45:22.980
Trog: I've never heard of that.

0:45:22.980,0:45:23.980
Baaulp: Yeah, what?

0:45:23.980,0:45:26.140
Gir: I loved it as a kid, I played it again
when I was, like, [crosstalk] I played it

0:45:26.140,0:45:27.140
like 3 or 4—

0:45:27.140,0:45:28.140
Wayne: Well, what is it?

0:45:28.140,0:45:29.140
Trog: Yeah, what kind of game?

0:45:29.140,0:45:32.579
Gir: It's like— I like, expunged it from
my memory. [crosstalk] I couldn't even tell

0:45:32.579,0:45:33.579
you anymore.

0:45:33.579,0:45:34.579
Trog: It's gone.

0:45:34.579,0:45:39.690
Baaulp: Good job. Good job, I guess, for getting
it out of your head. I know what my game is

0:45:39.690,0:45:48.190
for this question. Simpson's Treehouse of
Horror for the Nintendo— Game Boy Color.

0:45:48.190,0:45:55.960
I was poor, my parents had just bought me
my Game Boy Color, which was like, my first

0:45:55.960,0:46:01.710
game console. It was my birthday, and I was
like, "Hey, I have one game, like one video

0:46:01.710,0:46:06.270
game. Just one. Can I have more?" and they're
like "Sure, it's your birthday.", they bought

0:46:06.270,0:46:13.880
me two games. They bought me a port of Mario
Bros., like, the original, on Gameboy Color—

0:46:13.880,0:46:14.880
Trog: Oh, I had that, that was good.

0:46:14.880,0:46:17.810
Baaulp: They also bought me Simpsons Treehouse
of Horror, and I'm pretty sure I picked that

0:46:17.810,0:46:23.569
one 'cause I liked the Simpsons. That game
was trash. I played the hell out of it as

0:46:23.569,0:46:33.490
a kid, it is not good. It's like, it's just
a really shitty platformer with, like, really—

0:46:33.490,0:46:37.660
way too tight controls. The jump was like—
you couldn't control it, you just jumped a

0:46:37.660,0:46:39.940
set distance, and that's it.

0:46:39.940,0:46:44.530
Wayne: For my game, it was not one that I've
played in recent time. Like, I did not go

0:46:44.530,0:46:48.270
back and play it and then say "Oh man, this
is ass". I just remember loving this when

0:46:48.270,0:46:53.120
I was a kid, and then thinking back on it,
and seeing it. I dunno what the fuck I was

0:46:53.120,0:46:55.510
thinking, and this is the game Rugrats in
Paris.

0:46:55.510,0:46:57.150
Trog: Oh my god.

0:46:57.150,0:47:01.180
Wayne: Which came on a black N64 cartridge,
[crosstalk] and I do not know why.

0:47:01.180,0:47:02.180
Trog: Yup.

0:47:02.180,0:47:06.690
Wayne: But— so there were other Rugrats
games. There were tons of them. There was

0:47:06.690,0:47:09.160
one on PS1, it was a platformer. You play
as Tommy Pickles, you gotta find your Reptar

0:47:09.160,0:47:13.280
puzzle, it was great! It was fun. I'm pretty
sure in that game, there's a level where you

0:47:13.280,0:47:18.970
have to jump over electrified water, and if
you hit it, you are a baby and you die of

0:47:18.970,0:47:23.320
electrocution. That's unrelated. Rugrats in
Paris was basically just a game where you

0:47:23.320,0:47:27.819
walked around and then you went to an attraction
in a park and you played minigames to get

0:47:27.819,0:47:33.750
tickets. I don't remember too much about those
minigames, but the unbearably bad part of

0:47:33.750,0:47:39.400
this game, navigating? I apparently didn't
remember this at all. It was like, tank controls,

0:47:39.400,0:47:43.830
and you walked at the speed of a 2 year old
on— like, bipedally. [crosstalk] Not crawling.

0:47:43.830,0:47:44.830
Trog: Yeah.

0:47:44.830,0:47:49.440
Wayne: It was so fucking bad. [crosstalk]
I don't know how I enjoyed that as a child.

0:47:49.440,0:47:50.440
Gir: It's realistic.

0:47:50.440,0:47:51.440
Log: You walk at the speed of a Rugrat.

0:47:51.440,0:47:52.740
Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, it's realistic.

0:47:52.740,0:47:56.820
Wayne: I mean, yes, but— yes, but, I dunno.
I played it a lot. I don't know why I did.

0:47:56.820,0:47:57.820
I loved it.

0:47:57.820,0:47:58.820
Gir: [crosstalk] You were dumb.

0:47:58.820,0:48:01.740
Trog: You know, that's funny, that's a really
good segue into mine, because I have two in

0:48:01.740,0:48:06.410
mind that I both— I literally still own
them, they're sitting in my living room in

0:48:06.410,0:48:14.059
a box right now. The first one is Glover.
I had Glover for the N64 as a kid, and I think

0:48:14.059,0:48:19.260
the reason I didn't realize how bad it was
as a kid, is that, I was really bad at video

0:48:19.260,0:48:24.650
games and like, wasn't good enough to finish
a lot of them at that age. So I didn't realize,

0:48:24.650,0:48:30.450
like, it never even crossed my mind that Glover
was hard was because it controlled like fucking

0:48:30.450,0:48:34.850
shit, and I just thought I was bad at video
games. But then I went back and played it

0:48:34.850,0:48:39.089
as an adult, and I'm like "Oh no, this game
is still hard, because it controls like fucking

0:48:39.089,0:48:45.170
shit, and it's terrible!" So there's that
one, and the second one is Rugrats Scavenger

0:48:45.170,0:48:47.390
Hunt, and I don't know how, [crosstalk] I—

0:48:47.390,0:48:48.420
Wayne: What? For what console?

0:48:48.420,0:48:49.420
Gir: Two Rugrats.

0:48:49.420,0:48:54.579
Trog: I don't know how I got that game. I
think I asked for it, which was the weird

0:48:54.579,0:48:56.680
part, [crosstalk] but I don't have—

0:48:56.680,0:48:57.890
Wayne: What console? What console?

0:48:57.890,0:48:58.890
Trog: N64.

0:48:58.890,0:49:00.339
Wayne: What? What is this game?

0:49:00.339,0:49:06.059
Trog: It's called Rugrat Scavenger Hunt, it's
a board game, but not like Mario Party where

0:49:06.059,0:49:11.930
there's like, games to do. It's just a board
game. It's just a digital board game where

0:49:11.930,0:49:18.510
you roll dice and you walk around as the Rugrats.
And I don't know why I wanted this as a kid,

0:49:18.510,0:49:24.890
it doesn't make any sense. And it like, perplexes
me any time I remember that I own that game.

0:49:24.890,0:49:30.550
Wayne: Y'know, this is unrelated, but when
I was a kid— when I was young, when I was

0:49:30.550,0:49:38.119
like, really really young, I played N64. And
like, I don't think I understood how to get

0:49:38.119,0:49:43.240
games. Most— I had a couple games that I
just HAD, I never got more, and then I just

0:49:43.240,0:49:47.950
rented all the others. I didn't understand
the concept of buying a game for a really

0:49:47.950,0:49:52.710
long time. I don't know why. And then I got
like, Banjo-Tooie for Christmas, and I played

0:49:52.710,0:49:58.320
that game forever. I probably have like, 300
hours on Banjo-Tooie just as a child. But

0:49:58.320,0:50:01.079
uh, anybody else have any other bad childhood
games?

0:50:01.079,0:50:02.079
[50:00]

0:50:02.079,0:50:07.839
Log: Y'know, it's funny, 'cause like, I'm
realizing how rare it is for me to actually

0:50:07.839,0:50:09.880
go back to childhood games ever.

0:50:09.880,0:50:10.880
Wayne: Yeah, me too.

0:50:10.880,0:50:15.450
Log: I don't know if I've had this situation
just 'cause of like, how few games I played

0:50:15.450,0:50:17.830
in my childhood that I actually went back
to ever.

0:50:17.830,0:50:18.830
Trog: Really?

0:50:18.830,0:50:19.830
Wayne: Yeah.

0:50:19.830,0:50:23.530
Log: I dunno, games that I have gone— I
don't even know if this can count as "gone

0:50:23.530,0:50:28.400
back to", but like, Soulcalibur 2, I played
a lot of that. That feels even better, I played

0:50:28.400,0:50:32.430
that this weekend. Paper Mario, [crosstalk]
still Grade A.

0:50:32.430,0:50:33.430
Trog: Yeah, that games still great.

0:50:33.430,0:50:34.430
Log: A plus.

0:50:34.430,0:50:37.130
Gir: So the answer is no, [crosstalk] there's
no old games you dislike.

0:50:37.130,0:50:42.920
Log: SSX 3, [crosstalk] I played that on Dolphin
like a year ago or something, still pretty

0:50:42.920,0:50:43.920
good.

Baaulp: Oh hell yeah.

0:50:44.920,0:50:48.140
Log: There's a lot of games that I remember
playing the shit out of, like Mario and Luigi

0:50:48.140,0:50:56.049
Superstar Saga, and like, one of the Lord
of the Rings games, and like, Rayman, like

0:50:56.049,0:50:59.790
the original and stuff. But like, I haven't
played those games since I was a kid.

0:50:59.790,0:51:02.400
Baaulp: Dude, you just had good taste as a
kid.

0:51:02.400,0:51:06.040
Trog: Yeah, I was about to say, is what you're
saying just that you had really good taste

0:51:06.040,0:51:08.910
as a kid, and you didn't have any bad games?

0:51:08.910,0:51:11.589

bad game, [crosstalk] I recognized it?

0:51:13.000,0:51:15.940

of it.

0:51:22.530,0:51:25.380

I'll link—

Trog: I have no idea what this is.

0:51:29.760,0:51:32.599
Log: Yeah, so I spent 50 dollars on this game
when it came out.

0:51:32.599,0:51:33.599

0:51:33.599,0:51:40.910
Log: Whenever I was like, probably 10. And
just— it took me about a week or so, but

0:51:40.910,0:51:46.230
at that point I was like, "Yeah, I recognize
this as trash. This is unplayable."

0:51:46.230,0:51:52.520
Wayne: Okay, uh, one more video game related
question from me, myself. This is just one

0:51:52.520,0:51:56.970
I'm curious about. Did any of you guys play
any video games before you could read?

0:51:56.970,0:51:57.970
Baaulp: No.

0:51:57.970,0:51:59.320
Trog: Hm, [crosstalk] that's a good question.

0:51:59.320,0:52:00.320
Gir: Maybe.

0:52:00.320,0:52:01.320
Wayne: 'Cause I definitely did.

0:52:01.320,0:52:03.359
Trog: [crosstalk] Um... man, I dunno!

0:52:03.359,0:52:07.990
Log: Um... whenever I was like, 4, I got ahold
of some other kids Game Boy with a Pokémon

0:52:07.990,0:52:10.720
game in it, and I managed to overwrite the
save somehow.

0:52:10.720,0:52:14.510
Gir: Oh nice. That was like, my biggest fear,
was my little sister doing that.

0:52:14.510,0:52:17.980
Wayne: I played— I mean, how old were you
guys when you learned to read? That's another

0:52:17.980,0:52:18.980
question.

0:52:18.980,0:52:19.980
Gir: I don't fuckin' know.

0:52:19.980,0:52:21.690
Log: Honestly, it was either 4 or 5. [crosstalk]
I dunno.

0:52:21.690,0:52:22.690
Trog: Yeah.

0:52:22.690,0:52:23.690
Wayne: For me it was 5 or 6.

0:52:23.690,0:52:24.690
Trog: [crosstalk] Somewhere around 4 or 5,
but I think—

0:52:24.690,0:52:27.250
Baaulp: I learned how to read at 5, 'cause
that's also when I came to America.

0:52:27.250,0:52:34.200
Wayne: For me it was like 5 or 6. When I was
4— well, I turned 5 the same year the Game

0:52:34.200,0:52:41.030
Boy Advance released, but um— Yeah, I turned
5 in 2001. And that was the same year the

0:52:41.030,0:52:46.069
Game Boy Advance released, but that was also
a little bit after the Game Boy Advance released.

0:52:46.069,0:52:53.990
So at this time I was 4 years old, my brother
and my sister had Golden Sun, an RPG. And

0:52:53.990,0:52:57.609
I pretty much— when I was a kid, if there
was a video game, I wanted to play it. I didn't

0:52:57.609,0:53:02.450
care what it was, I saw cool colors on that
box, it was like "Hell yeah, gimme that shit."

0:53:02.450,0:53:03.710
Gir: Oh, that's a wordy game.

0:53:03.710,0:53:06.910
Wayne: Yeah, it's a very wordy game! But I
didn't even get to play the game, because

0:53:06.910,0:53:11.060
I launched it and got to the main menu, couldn't
read the words on the main menu, 'cause I

0:53:11.060,0:53:16.470
didn't know how to read. Navigated the menu
within one try. It wasn't trial and error,

0:53:16.470,0:53:19.450
just the first thing I did, was erase ALL
the saves.

0:53:19.450,0:53:20.450
Trog: Oh no.

0:53:20.450,0:53:26.849
Wayne: And my brother and sister were so mad
at me. And I did this AGAIN with, um... what

0:53:26.849,0:53:30.230
was the other game? Ocarina of Time. I wiped
the saves on that accidentally.

0:53:30.230,0:53:31.310
Trog: Oh man.

0:53:31.310,0:53:34.640
Wayne: I'm pretty sure I did this with Banjo-Tooie
as well. [crosstalk] I wiped the saves on

0:53:34.640,0:53:35.640
that.

0:53:35.640,0:53:36.640
Baaulp: You're a monster.

0:53:36.640,0:53:37.640
Gir: I would've kicked your ass.

0:53:37.640,0:53:40.910
Wayne: It was accidental EVERY time. But I
just managed— every single time navigating

0:53:40.910,0:53:44.280
the menus, I managed to wipe the saves trying
to access the game.

0:53:44.280,0:53:47.450
Baaulp: Gir, real quick, [crosstalk] do you
have an answer for that question?

0:53:47.450,0:53:48.530
Gir: I already said.

0:53:48.530,0:53:50.599
Trog: He said 1000 Winks or whatever.

0:53:50.599,0:53:52.700
Baaulp: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, that's right,
what the fuck is that?

0:53:52.700,0:53:53.700
Gir: 40 Winks.

0:53:53.700,0:53:54.700
Trog: 40 Winks, not 1000.

0:53:54.700,0:53:55.700
Wayne: 1000 Winks!

0:53:55.700,0:54:01.020
Trog: I'll be honest, Wayne, what you asked
has me so fucked up right now, 'cause I can't

0:54:01.020,0:54:06.970
remember ever not knowing how to read, and
I know that's not true, I know I wasn't born

0:54:06.970,0:54:09.050
and immediately knew how to read, [crosstalk]
but I can't—

0:54:09.050,0:54:10.640
Gir: 'Cause it was like, over 20 years ago.

0:54:10.640,0:54:11.970
Trog: I know, [crosstalk] but like, it's crazy!

0:54:11.970,0:54:16.319
Wayne: I can remember this— I think these
memories of deleting these save files are

0:54:16.319,0:54:18.936
what ties the memory [crosstalk] of not knowing
how to read and what that was like to my memory.

0:54:18.936,0:54:22.650
Trog: Yeah, that's probably— I probably
just don't have any strong memories of that.

0:54:22.650,0:54:23.650
Log: [crosstalk] Hey, hey—

0:54:23.650,0:54:25.559
Baaulp: Can we get uh, can we move onto the
next question?

0:54:25.559,0:54:26.559
Log: Well, hold on.

0:54:26.559,0:54:27.559
Wayne: Hold on.

0:54:27.559,0:54:28.559
Trog: Wait.

0:54:28.559,0:54:29.559
Baaulp: Okay.

0:54:29.559,0:54:30.559
Wayne: We’re having a good conversation.

0:54:30.559,0:54:31.559
Log: How old are you whenever you go to preschool?
If you go to preschool.

0:54:31.559,0:54:32.559
Gir: Like 5.

0:54:32.559,0:54:33.559
Trog: Probably 4.

0:54:33.559,0:54:34.559
Wayne: 5.

0:54:34.559,0:54:35.559
Trog: No, [crosstalk] I think you're 4.

0:54:35.559,0:54:36.559
Gir: Between 4 and 5.

0:54:36.559,0:54:37.559
Trog: You're between 4 and 5.

0:54:37.559,0:54:38.559
Wayne: No, yeah, it's 4. 'Cause you go to
kindergarten at 6, right?

0:54:38.559,0:54:39.559
Trog: No, [crosstalk] you go to kindergarten
at— well, you can, it depends on when you're

0:54:39.559,0:54:40.559
born.

0:54:40.559,0:54:41.559
Log: No, 5. You go to kindergarten at 5.

0:54:41.559,0:54:43.220
Trog: It's either 5 or 6.

0:54:43.220,0:54:45.260
Log: Like, I dunno, [crosstalk] I know I knew—

0:54:45.260,0:54:46.260
Wayne: I went when I was 10.

0:54:46.260,0:54:50.920
Log: I know I knew how to read in preschool,
because I distinctly remember they had mats

0:54:50.920,0:54:55.150
with peoples names on them, and I remember
just looking at one that said "Ray" on it.

0:54:55.150,0:54:56.880
Trog: Well there you go.

0:54:56.880,0:54:57.880
[55:00]

0:54:57.880,0:55:01.880
Wayne: I think around that time, I was learning
to read at a basic level, but like, I didn't—

0:55:01.880,0:55:07.480
it wasn't good enough that I could read like,
"New Game" "Erase All Save Files", like, those

0:55:07.480,0:55:09.990
aren't words that I was trained to read as
a 4 year old.

0:55:09.990,0:55:10.990
Log: But also—

0:55:10.990,0:55:11.990
Baaulp: That's what you think.

0:55:11.990,0:55:13.130
Log: I have like, some—

0:55:13.130,0:55:15.970
Wayne: That IS what I think, because I couldn't
read them, what the f— what?

0:55:15.970,0:55:21.079
Log: I think the earliest memory I have, and
I don't know why— I feel like I got hit

0:55:21.079,0:55:26.700
by a Men in Black memory fazer whenever I
was 2 years old, because I remember there

0:55:26.700,0:55:32.619
was a point— I was 2 years old, I was just
standing there, and suddenly I realized, "Hey,

0:55:32.619,0:55:38.830
I can talk!", and I just explained that to
my mom. "I can talk!", and she's like, "Yeah!",

0:55:38.830,0:55:41.560
and I just moved on with my life.

0:55:41.560,0:55:42.560
Trog: That's really good.

0:55:42.560,0:55:45.520
Log: And that's the earliest point that I
remember, so maybe just up until then, [crosstalk]

0:55:45.520,0:55:46.520
I just like, forgot myself.

0:55:46.520,0:55:48.130
Wayne: I like the idea that those were actually
your first words.

0:55:48.130,0:55:52.480
Trog: Well, Log, you realize whenever you
are a very young child, your brain literally

0:55:52.480,0:55:56.289
isn't developed enough to form memories, that's
probably why you don't remember.

0:55:56.289,0:56:00.970
Log: Well, I just think it's— I think it's
funny to imagine it like that, though.

0:56:00.970,0:56:06.910
Gir: I had an epiphany like that when I was
young, too. I must've been 3 or 4, and in

0:56:06.910,0:56:12.079
the middle of the night I suddenly woke up
and was like, "I can remember some stuff I

0:56:12.079,0:56:16.250
did.", I had the realization that I can remember
the past.

0:56:16.250,0:56:19.190
Trog: Man, my memory sucks compared to you
guys.

0:56:19.190,0:56:26.460
Baaulp: I distinctly remember my first memory.
I was asleep, I woke up like a drunk person

0:56:26.460,0:56:30.730
would, where I was like, "Wh-wh-what's going
on, what's happening?", and my moms like,

0:56:30.730,0:56:35.720
"Are you okay? You were asleep.", and I was
like, "Oh yeah, okay, cool.", and I went back

0:56:35.720,0:56:36.720
to sleep.

0:56:36.720,0:56:38.210
Trog: That's the most Baaulp thing I've ever
heard.

0:56:38.210,0:56:42.730
Wayne: I have like, 10 memories of falling
off my parents bed, the same exact way.

0:56:42.730,0:56:44.250
Baaulp: Holy shit!

0:56:44.250,0:56:46.059
Trog: Okay, I'm gonna read the—

0:56:46.059,0:56:49.430
Wayne: I used to roll off the bed so many
times, we should do a new question now, [crosstalk]

0:56:49.430,0:56:50.430
because we've been talking about this forever.

0:56:50.430,0:56:51.430
Trog: Yeah, we— we gotta, we gotta, we gotta—

0:56:51.430,0:56:52.549
Gir: Stay on topic here.

0:56:52.549,0:56:57.780
Trog: Okay, we have a question from friend
of the show Mira, who asks, "What is your

0:56:57.780,0:57:01.250
favorite bread item, and what is your least
favorite?"

0:57:01.250,0:57:04.650
Gir: I like garlic bread, but I don't like
wet bread.

0:57:04.650,0:57:05.650
Wayne: My lea—

0:57:05.650,0:57:10.420
Trog: Hold on, wait wait wait, before anybody
else goes, I just wanna ask, is everybody's

0:57:10.420,0:57:12.319
going to be garlic bread? [crosstalk] Because
mine—

0:57:12.319,0:57:13.319
Wayne: No. It's not my favorite.

0:57:13.319,0:57:14.319
Baaulp: No.

0:57:14.319,0:57:16.750
Trog: Okay, I'm just curious 'cause mine is
definitely garlic bread.

0:57:16.750,0:57:19.220
Baaulp: Yeah, garlic bread's good.

0:57:19.220,0:57:21.680
Gir: If not garlic bread, then banana bread.

0:57:21.680,0:57:24.900
Wayne: Alright, I have both of mine prepped.
One of the answers probably won't make sense

0:57:24.900,0:57:29.970
to anyone, 'cause I don't really know how
else to describe it, but uh... least favorite.

0:57:29.970,0:57:34.410
12 grain bread. I think it's 12 grain, I think
that's what they call it. [crosstalk] Maybe

0:57:34.410,0:57:35.410
it's like 15 grain, or something like that.

0:57:35.410,0:57:37.050
Gir: Is that the one with seeds all through
it?

0:57:37.050,0:57:41.130
Wayne: It's the ones with seeds in it, but—
it's the one with seeds in it that feel like

0:57:41.130,0:57:42.539
you're biting into flesh.

0:57:42.539,0:57:44.210
Trog: What the hell?

0:57:44.210,0:57:48.271
Wayne: It's a very fleshy nut, or seed, or
something in it. [crosstalk] It's just gross.

0:57:48.271,0:57:49.559
Trog: I've never had that before.

0:57:49.559,0:57:52.532
Log: Well, does it taste like anything, [crosstalk]
or is it just the texture?

0:57:52.532,0:57:53.589
Gir: It tastes like wheat bread.

0:57:53.589,0:57:58.560
Wayne: It's the texture. Well, it tastes like
a very strong whole grain bread, but I'll

0:57:58.560,0:58:02.829
eat whole grain. I'll eat that, whole wheat,
or whatever it is. It tastes like a very strong

0:58:02.829,0:58:06.380
whole wheat bread with the seeds in it. But
its that texture of just biting into this

0:58:06.380,0:58:08.870
chunky, meaty seed, [crosstalk] I hate it.

0:58:08.870,0:58:09.990
Gir: It's kind of leathery.

0:58:09.990,0:58:12.260
Wayne: Yeah, it's gross. [crosstalk] And my
favorite—

0:58:12.260,0:58:13.420
Gir: Not super great.

0:58:13.420,0:58:16.170
Wayne: Actually, I'll— someone else go,
I'll get back to my favorite, I gotta think

0:58:16.170,0:58:17.170
about this.

0:58:17.170,0:58:19.049
Baaulp: 'Cause you can't name cornbread or
uh, [crosstalk] garlic bread?

0:58:19.049,0:58:20.049
Wayne: No, it's not cornbread.

0:58:20.049,0:58:22.440
Log: Y'know, the shitty one out there, that
rye stuff.

0:58:22.440,0:58:23.440
Trog: Yeah.

0:58:23.440,0:58:24.440
Wayne: I love rye!

0:58:24.440,0:58:25.440
Trog: [crosstalk] I don't like rye either.

0:58:25.440,0:58:26.440
Wayne: Have you ever had rye pumpernickel
swirl?

0:58:26.440,0:58:30.740
Log: That's not a— that's not a bread taste,
I'm pretty sure. Pumpernickel's the other

0:58:30.740,0:58:32.190
one that doesn't taste like bread, right?

0:58:32.190,0:58:36.360
Trog: I mean, they're bread, [crosstalk] so
you're technically wrong, but...

0:58:36.360,0:58:37.590
Wayne: It tastes like bread.

0:58:37.590,0:58:38.590
Log: [crosstalk] What does pumpernickel look
like? I gotta, I gotta—

0:58:38.590,0:58:40.549
Wayne: Bread is not a flavor. Bread is a texture.

0:58:40.549,0:58:42.690
Trog: Bread is not a flavor, you're right.

0:58:42.690,0:58:43.690
Wayne: It's true!

0:58:43.690,0:58:46.780
Baaulp: You guys suck at this. I'm gonna go
next. [crosstalk] I like... cornbread—

0:58:46.780,0:58:48.180
Log: Oh wait, pumpernickel's fine.

0:58:48.180,0:58:50.140
Wayne: Log was not done, but okay.

0:58:50.140,0:58:51.270
Trog: Log wasn't done.

0:58:51.270,0:58:53.730
Log: Yeah, wait— [crosstalk] OR is pumpernickel
the bad one?

0:58:53.730,0:58:54.800
Trog: Cut this out.

0:58:54.800,0:58:57.220
Wayne: Baaulp, YOU suck, because you suck
at podcasting!

0:58:57.220,0:58:58.220
Baaulp: What?

0:58:58.220,0:58:59.359
Log: Okay, yeah, yeah— okay, yeah—

0:58:59.359,0:59:00.440
Gir: Every fucking time!

0:59:00.440,0:59:05.010
Log: I think if you gave me a pumpernickel
rye swirl bread, I would die on impact.

0:59:05.010,0:59:06.520
Wayne: No, it's so good!

0:59:06.520,0:59:11.240
Log: Those are the two worst flavors of bread
in existence by far.

0:59:11.240,0:59:15.690
Wayne: It's got like a sour-ish kind of taste,
with a very savory flavor. It's so good, it's

0:59:15.690,0:59:19.420
so good with like, a turkey cheese mayo, just
somethin' simple on that... Mmm!

0:59:19.420,0:59:25.180
Log: It tastes like you've got a weird perfume,
like a weird— like you've somehow got a

0:59:25.180,0:59:27.130
smell on your bread, [crosstalk] and you're
tasting the smell.

0:59:27.130,0:59:28.130
Gir: Potpourri bread.

0:59:28.130,0:59:29.130

0:59:29.130,0:59:30.130

0:59:30.130,0:59:31.130

0:59:31.130,0:59:32.380
Log: [crosstalk] Don't know what that means!

0:59:32.380,0:59:35.200
Wayne: That's what its called! I'm pretty
sure that's what its called. Y'know, is Pepperidge

0:59:35.200,0:59:37.119
Farms the company with the bread and the goldfish?

0:59:37.119,0:59:38.160

0:59:38.160,0:59:39.160
Trog: Yeah.

0:59:39.160,0:59:42.599
Wayne: Pepperidge Farms makes— I think its
called like, Jewish Bake Rye Pumpernickel

0:59:42.599,0:59:44.000
Swirl, or maybe it's like, Hebrew, I dunno—

0:59:44.000,0:59:48.420
Log: I just found an image on Google Images
of Pepperidge Farms Jewish Pumpernickel Dark

0:59:48.420,0:59:49.420
Pump.

0:59:49.420,0:59:50.420
Gir: Dark Pump!

0:59:50.420,0:59:52.220
Wayne: No, that's not what I'm talking about!
It's Rye Pumpernickel Swirl!

0:59:52.220,0:59:53.680
Trog: No, [crosstalk] it's Dark Pump!

0:59:53.680,0:59:55.140
Wayne: It is definitely Jewish, though.

0:59:55.140,0:59:57.770
Log: I think that those two are very disappointing.

[1:00:00]

0:59:58.770,1:00:04.380
Log: However, I will give you an insight into
a good bread item. Recently, I've been getting

1:00:04.380,1:00:06.740
into new bread.

1:00:06.740,1:00:09.099
Gir: Experimental breads.

1:00:09.099,1:00:12.619
Log: Yeah. Have you guys ever had bread pudding?

1:00:12.619,1:00:14.000
Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, I hate it.

1:00:14.000,1:00:15.000
Trog: Uh, I have.

1:00:15.000,1:00:16.000
Wayne: I don't think so! [crosstalk] I don't
think I've ever had it.

1:00:16.000,1:00:17.960
Gir: I change my mind, that's my least favorite
bread item, [crosstalk] is fucking bread pudding.

1:00:17.960,1:00:19.190

1:00:19.190,1:00:22.410

different kinds, 'cause I mean, it just depends

1:00:22.410,1:00:27.480
on what bread you have. But recently, I've
had bread pudding, and like... I've never

1:00:27.480,1:00:33.480
had bread pudding before this past month.
But I've had it a couple times this past month,

1:00:33.480,1:00:40.190
since... pretty much since I've started my
job, and it's like, "Mmm. That's some good

1:00:40.190,1:00:41.190
stuff."

1:00:41.190,1:00:43.760
Gir: Nope, can't stand that shit.

1:00:43.760,1:00:48.569
Log: There was a day where I had access to
a dessert bar with unlimited desserts that

1:00:48.569,1:00:54.339
had bread pudding at it. That was some nice
times. I almost got it today, but I resisted

1:00:54.339,1:00:56.039
because it costed 3 dollars.

1:00:56.039,1:00:58.250
Gir: How 'bout you, Baaulp?

1:00:58.250,1:01:03.540
Trog: It's the best bread you've ever had,
but I refuse to spend any more than 2 dollars

1:01:03.540,1:01:04.540
on it.

1:01:04.540,1:01:07.170
Log: Well, it's just that the meal that I
already had costed like, 10.

1:01:07.170,1:01:09.910
Trog: Yeah, no, I get you. [crosstalk] I was
just making fun of you.

1:01:09.910,1:01:10.910
Gir: I wouldn't spend more than 3 dollars.

1:01:10.910,1:01:15.380
Baaulp: My favorite bread, cornbread. I can
inhale that stuff.

1:01:15.380,1:01:16.920
Wayne: Cornbread is pretty good.

1:01:16.920,1:01:19.490
Baaulp: Cornbread is sooo fucking good.

1:01:19.490,1:01:20.849
Wayne: I like a cornbread.

1:01:20.849,1:01:24.560
Log: Do you like it with the corn in it, or
the corn, like, [crosstalk] hidden?

1:01:24.560,1:01:26.020
Gir: Out of it.

1:01:26.020,1:01:29.589
Baaulp: Uh, I hope the corn is not just still
in chunks.

1:01:29.589,1:01:30.870
Wayne: Is chunky cornbread a thing?

1:01:30.870,1:01:31.870
Log: Yeah, [crosstalk] there's chunky cornbread.

1:01:31.870,1:01:32.870
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:01:32.870,1:01:33.870
Wayne: Ew! EW! [crosstalk] Who would eat that
shit? That's vile!

1:01:33.870,1:01:36.530
Log: You can have cornbread with like, visible
corn in it.

1:01:36.530,1:01:37.770
Baaulp: That’s gross.

1:01:37.770,1:01:38.770
Wayne: That's fucking vile!

1:01:38.770,1:01:41.190
Trog: I guess you're not as big of a cornbread
fan as you thought.

1:01:41.190,1:01:42.920
Gir: Cornbread's supposed to be made of corn
MEAL, not actual corn.

1:01:42.920,1:01:45.680
Baaulp: Yeah, not— [crosstalk] it's corn
MEAL, not corn. Corn.

1:01:45.680,1:01:49.420
Log: Y'all city slickers never been down to
the south, we got—

1:01:49.420,1:01:52.400
Gir: I HAVE, and they don't eat it there.

1:01:52.400,1:01:56.000
Log: We got a different whole view of corn
'round here. [crosstalk] We put it right in

1:01:56.000,1:01:57.000
the bread.

1:01:57.000,1:01:58.000
Trog: We put wasps in our cornbread.

1:01:58.000,1:01:59.849
Gir: We put wasps— we pull it out of our
corn holes!

1:01:59.849,1:02:01.799
Wayne: Log, is your cornbread chunky?

1:02:01.799,1:02:04.470
Log: I don't eat cornbread very much.

1:02:04.470,1:02:05.470
Wayne: Okay.

1:02:05.470,1:02:07.079
Log: Usually it's not, but sometimes it is.

1:02:07.079,1:02:10.270
Baaulp: Well, try smooth cornbread. Maybe
you'll like it more.

1:02:10.270,1:02:14.230
Wayne: It's so good, if your cornbread is
smooth. Mmm! It's like a cornish butter.

1:02:14.230,1:02:17.940
Baaulp: The next time you guys come to Boston,
we're gonna have to try to go to a place called

1:02:17.940,1:02:21.660
Fat Cat. No matter what you get, they bring
out cornbread. [crosstalk] And like—

1:02:21.660,1:02:23.030
Gir: This is an advertisement.

1:02:23.030,1:02:25.220
Baaulp: Honey butter, and hummus, it's so
good.

1:02:25.220,1:02:27.000
Trog: Yeah, no free plugs, Baaulp. Come on.

1:02:27.000,1:02:28.000
Log: [crosstalk] Cornbread and hummus?

1:02:28.000,1:02:29.000
Wayne: No locations, no locations.

1:02:29.000,1:02:30.940
Trog: They gotta pay us if they want advertising.

1:02:30.940,1:02:34.609
Gir: Woah, wait, yeah. That's a weird ass
combo. Cornbread and hummus?

1:02:34.609,1:02:38.029
Baaulp: It's so good. It's all so good, I've
put it all in my mouth.

1:02:38.029,1:02:39.859
Trog: Yeah, that doesn't sound that bad.

1:02:39.859,1:02:46.400
Wayne: I could eat that. That— oh, that
just sparked a fucking culinary brain blast.

1:02:46.400,1:02:47.400
That sounds delicious.

1:02:47.400,1:02:48.400
Baaulp: Anyway—

1:02:48.400,1:02:52.940
Wayne: Okay, I wanna hear your least favorite,
'cause I think it could be the biggest upset.

1:02:52.940,1:02:53.940
Log: Oh no, hold on!

1:02:53.940,1:02:54.940
Wayne: What?

1:02:54.940,1:03:01.650
Log: This is a Mira question, and I got like
a fuckin'... amnesia revival, 'cause you said

1:03:01.650,1:03:06.080
brain blast. 'Cause I just remembered something
Mira talked about where he had his dream where

1:03:06.080,1:03:13.619
he was watching two people argue, and it got
like— it did like a brain blast camera pan

1:03:13.619,1:03:19.710
into the guys brain, and instead of him saying
"brain blast" at the end, he just burped really

1:03:19.710,1:03:20.920
aggressively.

1:03:20.920,1:03:25.580
Wayne: Okay, Baaulp, least favorite bread
item.

1:03:25.580,1:03:30.250
Baaulp: My least favorite bread? I gotta go
with Log. I don't like rye, I don't like pumpernickel.

1:03:30.250,1:03:31.819
Trog: Ooh, yeah. [crosstalk] Fuck 'em!

1:03:31.819,1:03:34.910
Wayne: Pumper— ugh. Fuck you! I must be
the only one that likes it, [crosstalk] I

1:03:34.910,1:03:35.910
love it.

1:03:35.910,1:03:36.910
Trog: You are!

1:03:36.910,1:03:37.910
Baaulp: You got a weird tongue.

1:03:37.910,1:03:38.910
Gir: I have no strong opinion.

1:03:38.910,1:03:40.750
Wayne: It's an aged flavor. It requires a
very— particular taste.

1:03:40.750,1:03:43.289
Baaulp: I don't want my bread old or sour.

1:03:43.289,1:03:44.289
Log: I don’t— I don’t like ‘em.

1:03:44.289,1:03:45.390
Wayne: It's not old! [crosstalk] And it's
not sour!

1:03:45.390,1:03:46.390
Trog: It's not sour. That's sourdough.

1:03:46.390,1:03:47.390
Wayne: You don't like sourdough?

1:03:47.390,1:03:48.390
Baaulp: No.

1:03:48.390,1:03:49.390
Trog: I like sourdough.

1:03:49.390,1:03:50.390
Gir: I like sourdough.

1:03:50.390,1:03:51.390
Trog: Sourdough's good.

1:03:51.390,1:03:54.770
Wayne: It has a— it's like a minor sour
flavor, but it's not literally sour.

1:03:54.770,1:04:02.160
Gir: Hey, you ever dip au jus— uh— dub—
dip sou— fuckin' Jesus. Hold on, I'm havin'

1:04:02.160,1:04:04.010
a brain meltdown.

1:04:04.010,1:04:05.010
Baaulp: *buuuurp*

1:04:05.010,1:04:07.460
Gir: You ever dip sourdough bread into au
jus sauce?

1:04:07.460,1:04:08.640
Wayne: Au jus sauce?

1:04:08.640,1:04:09.640
Log: Probably.

1:04:09.640,1:04:10.900
Trog: No, but that sounds really good.

1:04:10.900,1:04:14.120
Baaulp: I've dipped other breads into au jus
sauce.

1:04:14.120,1:04:15.730
Gir: It's super fucking good.

1:04:15.730,1:04:16.890
Wayne: I don't know what that is.

1:04:16.890,1:04:18.300
Trog: You've never had a french dip?

1:04:18.300,1:04:19.300
Gir: It's watery gravy.

1:04:19.300,1:04:20.760
Wayne: Oh, I've had french dip.

1:04:20.760,1:04:21.849
Gir: I'll give you a french dip.

1:04:21.849,1:04:22.930
Trog: [crosstalk] That's the kind of sauce
in a french dip.

1:04:22.930,1:04:23.930
Wayne: I didn't know that's what that was
called.

1:04:23.930,1:04:25.470
Trog: Wayne, did you say your favorite bread—
[crosstalk] is it cornbread?

1:04:25.470,1:04:28.520
Wayne: I haven't said my favorite yet, but
I'm gonna go over some runners-up, because

1:04:28.520,1:04:31.789
I'm having a real hard time picking it. It's
not cornbread. You know what's really good?

1:04:31.789,1:04:33.280
Bread bowls. Bread bowls for soup. [crosstalk]
That shit's delicious.

1:04:33.280,1:04:34.280
Baaulp: But that's not like, a type of bread.

1:04:34.280,1:04:36.500
Trog: Yeah. No, that counts. That counts as
a bread item.

1:04:36.500,1:04:38.569
Wayne: But that is a flavor, [crosstalk] because
it's a type of sourdough.

1:04:38.569,1:04:39.569
Gir: That's a shape of bread.

1:04:39.569,1:04:40.569
Trog: The question was not the—

1:04:40.569,1:04:41.840
Wayne: It's a type of sourdough. It's a specific
type of bread that makes bread bowls.

1:04:41.840,1:04:42.840
Baaulp: Oh my god.

1:04:42.840,1:04:43.840
Trog: [crosstalk] The question was not—

1:04:43.840,1:04:44.840
Gir: What shape of bread do you like?

1:04:44.840,1:04:48.950
Trog: Look. The question was "favorite bread
item". It didn't say, like, type of bread.

1:04:48.950,1:04:50.170
[crosstalk] So it could be a pretzel.

1:04:50.170,1:04:51.170
Gir: That's fair.

1:04:51.170,1:04:53.020
Wayne: Yeah, I like bread armor. Bread castle.

1:04:53.020,1:04:54.020
Trog: Yeah.

1:04:54.020,1:04:55.020
Baaulp: Eh.

1:04:55.020,1:04:56.020
Gir: Move on.

1:04:56.020,1:04:58.930
Wayne: Did that concept just like, flatline
you guys?

1:04:58.930,1:04:59.930
Trog: [crosstalk] Eh. No, I'm good.

1:04:59.930,1:05:00.930
Gir: Yes.

1:05:00.930,1:05:01.930
[1:05:00]

1:05:01.930,1:05:02.930
Wayne: I picked a bread item, what-the-fuck
do you want?

1:05:02.930,1:05:03.930
Gir: [crosstalk] What-the-fuck?

1:05:03.930,1:05:04.930
Trog: No, it's good.

1:05:04.930,1:05:06.474
Wayne: Okay, so other bread item runners-up.
Naan. Naan is so good. [crosstalk] I love

1:05:06.474,1:05:07.474
naan.

1:05:07.474,1:05:08.474
Trog: Oh yeah, naan's good too.

1:05:08.474,1:05:09.474
Wayne: Naan is delicious.

1:05:09.474,1:05:10.474
Gir: It's a naan-bread.

1:05:10.474,1:05:13.950
Wayne: But I think number 1— It's just this—
like, Italian bread, but its specifically

1:05:13.950,1:05:17.279
from this one restaurant, they give you these
rolls, Bertucci's, it's a chain, I was talking

1:05:17.279,1:05:21.110
about these the other week, they're so good.
They're hot, they're fresh. [crosstalk] They're

1:05:21.110,1:05:22.110
good. This is my ???.

1:05:22.110,1:05:26.869
Baaulp: Hold up, hold up. The rolls they give
you for free at Bertucci's is your number

1:05:26.869,1:05:27.869
1?

1:05:27.869,1:05:28.869
Wayne: Yes! Those are so good.

1:05:28.869,1:05:29.869
Baaulp: Come on, man.

1:05:29.869,1:05:30.869
Trog: [crosstalk] Mine is just garlic bread,
and garlic bread is—

1:05:30.869,1:05:31.869
Wayne: Have you been to Bertucci's?

1:05:31.869,1:05:32.869
Baaulp: Yes!

1:05:32.869,1:05:33.869
Wayne: Those shits are so good.

1:05:33.869,1:05:37.200
Baaulp: That's not even the garlic bread,
oh my fucking god.

1:05:37.200,1:05:40.970
Wayne: It's not garlic bread! It's fluffy,
fresh baked, Italiano bread, my friend.

1:05:40.970,1:05:42.490
Log: Have you ever been to the House of Flying
Rolls?

1:05:42.490,1:05:43.660
Wayne: No! Next question.

1:05:43.660,1:05:44.849
Gir: Is that a church?

1:05:44.849,1:05:48.869
Trog: Wait, hang on, this just reminded me,
and then we'll move on. But since you got

1:05:48.869,1:05:54.810
to do two, I wanna say that my runner-up is
those Pillsbury pull-apart biscuits where

1:05:54.810,1:05:58.230
you bake them, and they turn into like, magical
layers, [crosstalk] and you peel 'em apart.

1:05:58.230,1:05:59.230
Wayne: Oh, like dinner rolls?

1:05:59.230,1:06:00.230
Trog: [crosstalk] I don't know exactly what
they are.

1:06:00.230,1:06:01.230
Gir: Put honey on those, and they're even
better.

1:06:01.230,1:06:03.240
Trog: Yeah, those are hella good. Alright,
next question.

1:06:03.240,1:06:07.359
Log: I caught a roll at the House of Flying
Rolls and I cried 'cause it was hot.

1:06:07.359,1:06:14.109
Trog: Next question we have from KingMusicManz
who says, "Tips on DMing and playing D&D?"

1:06:14.109,1:06:16.810
Gir: Oh, this is not for me!

1:06:16.810,1:06:24.339
Log: Alright, here's the Log Advice. You've
never seen me in action, so like, you might

1:06:24.339,1:06:29.839
be thinking "Who the fuck is this guy? He
just plays as Porky Bashwagon!", here's the

1:06:29.839,1:06:36.849
real trick that everybody loves. Whenever
you DM, if you have NPCs that your characters

1:06:36.849,1:06:41.250
are gonna meet, don't even think of a name
for them until they've walked up and talked

1:06:41.250,1:06:47.770
to the NPC. You'll produce some top quality
shit, my friend.

1:06:47.770,1:06:51.140
Wayne: Do you have examples? I can't remember.

1:06:51.140,1:06:54.089
Gir: Me neither. [crosstalk] That's the drawback.

1:06:54.089,1:06:59.800
Log: Whenever I was in charge— so, like,
the drawback is that they don't remember and

1:06:59.800,1:07:04.940
neither do I. So there's some characters I'm
pretty sure I changed the name of every time

1:07:04.940,1:07:05.940
they talked to them.

1:07:05.940,1:07:07.369
Trog: [crosstalk] I remember a couple.

1:07:07.369,1:07:08.829
Log: There's a couple.

1:07:08.829,1:07:09.829
Wayne: Nermal.

1:07:09.829,1:07:14.520
Log: Yeah, there's Nerm— well, Nermal's
just Nermal from Garfield, so that doesn't

1:07:14.520,1:07:15.520
count.

1:07:15.520,1:07:18.589
Wayne: You planned that one. You downloaded
a picture of Nermal and put it in roll20.

1:07:18.589,1:07:19.589
Log: Yeah.

1:07:19.589,1:07:20.589
Trog: Yeah, that one was right there.

1:07:20.589,1:07:25.170
Log: But there was a time where these boys,
and all of these boys were playin' in my campaign,

1:07:25.170,1:07:32.190
they walked up to a guy and that guy was just
a guy that I immediately thought up of, and

1:07:32.190,1:07:36.220
I got into my character voice and I said,
"Yeah man, what's up? Name's Faucet."

1:07:36.220,1:07:37.220
Trog: Oh yeah, Faucet!

1:07:37.220,1:07:38.220
Gir: Oh yeah, Faucet.

1:07:38.220,1:07:39.220
Wayne: Faucet was good.

1:07:39.220,1:07:42.799
Trog: Faucet was good. I think the most—

1:07:42.799,1:07:49.420
Log: And then I'm pretty sure I named an ogre
Ice Cream, [crosstalk] that was an ogre who

1:07:49.420,1:07:50.430
selled Ice Cream.

1:07:50.430,1:07:51.430
Gir: Yes, you did.

1:07:51.430,1:07:52.430
Trog: Yeah. I'm pretty sure.

1:07:52.430,1:07:53.430
Wayne: Yes, yes, his name was Ice Cream.

1:07:53.430,1:07:55.260
Trog: I remember Grill Skillman.

1:07:55.260,1:07:57.849
Log: Oh yeah! Gilly Skill— No, it was Gilly
Skillman.

1:07:57.849,1:07:58.849
Trog: [crosstalk] Gilly Skillman,

1:07:58.849,1:08:03.400
Wayne: A good name from an ancient campaign,
Baaulp's campaign, the first one we ever played

1:08:03.400,1:08:08.090
together, was Slappo the Dwarf, a jail guard
who just slapped your hands if you stuck them

1:08:08.090,1:08:09.090
out of the cell.

1:08:09.090,1:08:14.190
Trog: Yeah. That's a good character, but they're
looking for tips. Do we have any more tips

1:08:14.190,1:08:15.190
for DMing or playing D&D?

1:08:15.190,1:08:20.699
Baaulp: On character creation, I think—
for the longest time I thought "Eh, whatever",

1:08:20.699,1:08:27.049
but everyone seems to like the dumb characters.
I don't know how much of it is me playing

1:08:27.049,1:08:33.460
them, and how much it is because the characters
are good, but I basically just have two roles

1:08:33.460,1:08:40.299
whenever I make player characters or important
characters. A: They have to follow, like,

1:08:40.299,1:08:47.520
a simple set of rules, and when you're playing
the character, you have to abide by them.

1:08:47.520,1:08:57.780
They— I try to make them goofy, like Midet
is a bounty hunter, so he has to just cut

1:08:57.780,1:09:03.089
off peoples heads and like, that's it. Every
time you kill someone important like, "Hey,

1:09:03.089,1:09:08.359
how do we prove we actually got this guy?
I know, I'll chop their head off." Very good

1:09:08.359,1:09:13.060
being like— I guess he ended up not being
a pacifist, but he was very timid.

1:09:13.060,1:09:14.060
Trog: Yeah, no.

1:09:14.060,1:09:17.600
Baaulp: You just have to pick something [crosstalk]
and stick with it, if you can.

1:09:17.600,1:09:19.580
Log: Keep in mind, you just listed two characters
that nobody has heard of.

1:09:19.580,1:09:23.120
Trog: Keep in mind people listening have no
idea who these people are. But I understand

1:09:23.120,1:09:24.120
the advice.

1:09:24.120,1:09:32.779
Log: But like, to explain— well, this isn't
really a DMing part, but what Baaulp creates

1:09:32.779,1:09:38.859
consistently some of the best characters ever,
and it's because he just draws from himself

1:09:38.859,1:09:43.819
for a lot. He doesn't, like— he's playing
a character, but he's still not making himself

1:09:43.819,1:09:48.859
into something he's not. So it's very authentic
and good feeling.

1:09:48.859,1:09:54.560
Baaulp: Yeah, if you can take a little piece
of yourself, not like— don't make your character

1:09:54.560,1:10:02.290
YOU, but pick a quality that you already are,
I guess, and try to spin that into something.

1:10:02.290,1:10:03.290
[1:10:00]

1:10:03.290,1:10:08.210
Baaulp: It'll be good for beginners, too,
if you're not accustomed to putting yourself

1:10:08.210,1:10:13.080
in a really crazy roll where you're pretending
to be someone that you entirely aren't.

1:10:13.080,1:10:18.770
Wayne: Yeah, I won't name names, but there
are certain Dungeons and Dragons characters

1:10:18.770,1:10:23.870
that are something you entirely aren't, and
they did not turn out very good. Definitely

1:10:23.870,1:10:28.670
draw from yourself a little bit. Are you a
loud person? Play a loud character. Are you

1:10:28.670,1:10:32.900
a psychic that wants to battle for mind wits?
You play that.

1:10:32.900,1:10:34.909
Gir: Are you actually a psychic?

1:10:34.909,1:10:40.520
Wayne: My DM tip: make sure that you don't
make your characters do something just for

1:10:40.520,1:10:45.130
the sake of doing it that wouldn't already
be part of their personal motivations. Like,

1:10:45.130,1:10:49.190
if they're questing— if they're doing a
quest, and really their only characters personal

1:10:49.190,1:10:52.570
motivation is "We're doing this, we're gonna
get money at the end", but that's not the

1:10:52.570,1:10:57.130
characters goal, it makes for a very boring
time. That's something that I learned from

1:10:57.130,1:11:03.980
doing my campaign, where I sent the players
off following an old man, doing a mission—

1:11:03.980,1:11:06.710
a secretive mission that he couldn't tell
them anything about, because that was part

1:11:06.710,1:11:10.940
of the plot. I found very quickly, none of
the characters really had any investment,

1:11:10.940,1:11:14.780
because they were just kind of doing it because
I told them to. Player agency is really important,

1:11:14.780,1:11:17.660
and that's something I came to learn by doing
that campaign.

1:11:17.660,1:11:21.790
Log: Yeah, that's a big thing. That's probably
like, a lot of things people get all confused

1:11:21.790,1:11:26.440
about in these modern times. Don't try to
be The Adventure Zone, don't try to be Critical

1:11:26.440,1:11:27.440
Role or whatever.

1:11:27.440,1:11:28.720
Trog: Yeah, don't, definitely.

1:11:28.720,1:11:35.020
Log: Don't try and make a fuckin' story, alright?
You have— basically, you just come up with

1:11:35.020,1:11:41.670
a couple ideas, and don't expect— you have
to just make up stuff. I talked about coming

1:11:41.670,1:11:46.350
up with a guy named Faucet as a joke, but
it's just like— you have to do stuff like

1:11:46.350,1:11:55.650
that, because if you have humans as your players,
they will not follow a path. And if they have

1:11:55.650,1:11:57.540
to follow a path, it's kinda lame, right?

1:11:57.540,1:12:02.280
Wayne: My original idea with that campaign
was like, "Yeah, there's a bigger story, and

1:12:02.280,1:12:06.341
that's how I'm gonna piece together in these
individual, like, set-pieces, where they can

1:12:06.341,1:12:09.650
play around freely and do whatever they want
in those set-pieces, accomplishing the one

1:12:09.650,1:12:13.960
greater goal". But, I feel like what you were
saying about, is like, yeah, come up with

1:12:13.960,1:12:20.420
these concepts. Come up with your grand overarching
concepts, but let them come to that when they

1:12:20.420,1:12:26.050
come to that on their own. If you've got this
really cool idea for a big story thing, you

1:12:26.050,1:12:31.239
don't wanna force them into it. Don't just
walk them to it, let them stumble upon it,

1:12:31.239,1:12:32.239
I guess. 

1:12:32.239,1:12:35.301
Gir: Yeah, I think it's really important to
remember that you don't be Mr. No Fun, and

1:12:35.301,1:12:40.090
force people along the way you want them to
go. You gotta let them fuck around every now

1:12:40.090,1:12:41.090
and then.

1:12:41.090,1:12:42.090
Log: And that's still hard, but—

1:12:42.090,1:12:46.310
Wayne: And even that, that still happens.
My campaign, I don't think it was bad, I just

1:12:46.310,1:12:51.230
think like, in terms of character development
and worldbuilding, it was boring just because

1:12:51.230,1:12:57.690
there was no— they were basically following
a line in terms of "Yeah, you need to go this

1:12:57.690,1:13:02.400
way and do this thing", they couldn't go to
the places they wanted to go. Once they were

1:13:02.400,1:13:06.000
in a place, it was like, whatever. I wasn't
like, "Okay, go to this house, then this house,

1:13:06.000,1:13:11.250
then this house!", do whatever, I dunno. Let
the players run free, let them find the things

1:13:11.250,1:13:14.179
you've put for them. Don't ensure that they
get them.

1:13:14.179,1:13:16.050
Gir: You've made up a world, let them explore
it.

1:13:16.050,1:13:22.389
Trog: I think the best way I've heard of describing
to make sure that stuff like that doesn't

1:13:22.389,1:13:29.750
happen is, you have to think about if you're
the DM, you're creating a world, and the world

1:13:29.750,1:13:36.060
should happen— events in the world should
happen whether or not your players are there

1:13:36.060,1:13:41.990
to witness them. So if you have something
planned, it shouldn't be, like, "Oh, the players

1:13:41.990,1:13:46.330
will go here, and that will trigger this to
happen." It should be more like, "Something

1:13:46.330,1:13:50.969
will happen at this place, and if the players
are around to see it, then they get to experience

1:13:50.969,1:13:54.770
it. If they're not, then maybe the events
will go down in a different way, but the event

1:13:54.770,1:13:56.620
still happens." Y'know?

1:13:56.620,1:14:02.790
Wayne: Remember that your world— it's not
like a video game, it's not a video game.

1:14:02.790,1:14:09.420
I think that's actually in general, not just
for this single concept, a good tip. But remember

1:14:09.420,1:14:13.740
that it's not a video game, it doesn't have
to work like a video game. It's not like these

1:14:13.740,1:14:16.940
things that are happening in your world are
not gonna render if your players aren't next

1:14:16.940,1:14:17.940
to it.

1:14:17.940,1:14:21.080
Trog: Yeah. Well, see, it's funny that you
mention that, because my next piece of advice

1:14:21.080,1:14:29.610
was actually just going to be, "Go and play
Divinity 2. Go buy it on Steam." Go play Divinity

1:14:29.610,1:14:33.810
2, because it's really good, and I dunno.
Playing that game— if you don't know what

1:14:33.810,1:14:37.250
Divinity 2 is, it's a, uh—

1:14:37.250,1:14:38.410
Wayne: CRPG.

1:14:38.410,1:14:42.220
Trog: CRPG. Really good, you don't have to
play the first one to play the second one.

1:14:42.220,1:14:47.800
I never played the first one and i absolutely
loe the second one. But playing that game

1:14:47.800,1:14:53.830
just got me like... SUPER back into wanting
to DM again. And I dunno if it's just the

1:14:53.830,1:14:58.010
fact that it's an RPG or just the fact that
it's like, I dunno. Something about that game.

1:14:58.010,1:14:59.010
[crosstalk] Maybe, y'know—

1:14:59.010,1:15:00.560
Wayne: It's a really cool fantasy world.

1:15:00.560,1:15:01.560
[1:15:00]

1:15:01.560,1:15:02.560
Trog: Yeah.

1:15:02.560,1:15:05.430
Wayne: It's a really cool story with really
cool grander concepts, and also I think one

1:15:05.430,1:15:10.190
thing I love about it is the individual aspect
of every sidequest.

1:15:10.190,1:15:11.190
Trog: Yeah.

1:15:11.190,1:15:13.360
Wayne: Every little side quest is like—
some sidequests might just be like, "Hey,

1:15:13.360,1:15:17.210
there are these two cows. They're people.
They were turned into cows. Go get them a

1:15:17.210,1:15:20.010
potion. Pick which one you want to become
a human again." and then that's over.

1:15:20.010,1:15:21.010
Trog: Yeah.

1:15:21.010,1:15:25.560
Wayne: But then another sidequest is this
big, giant, crazy thing. That's another thing

1:15:25.560,1:15:29.679
in D&D. Make little, silly, weird things happen.
Or cool things happen.

1:15:29.679,1:15:30.679
Gir: Be creative.

1:15:30.679,1:15:34.159
Wayne: It's a fantasy world. You could run
into a talking frog that wants you to bring

1:15:34.159,1:15:36.850
it a huge loaf of bread. Some shit like that,
I dunno.

1:15:36.850,1:15:40.100
Gir: Or doesn't even have to be a fantasy
world. It could be a fuckin' sci-fi world.

1:15:40.100,1:15:41.100
Wayne: Well, yeah. Whatever—

1:15:41.100,1:15:42.100
Trog: Yeah, exactly.

1:15:42.100,1:15:43.100
Gir: [crosstalk] It could be cowboy world.

1:15:43.100,1:15:44.330
Wayne: It's still fantasy no matter what.
Like, you're playing D&D, you don't get away

1:15:44.330,1:15:45.330
from the fantasy.

1:15:45.330,1:15:48.830
Gir: My point is you don't have to do high
fantasy if you don't want to.

1:15:48.830,1:15:49.830
Trog: Nah.

1:15:49.830,1:15:52.590
Wayne: Don't play your game in the real world!
Don't do that!

1:15:52.590,1:15:53.590
Baaulp: Don't LARP. LARPing is bad.

1:15:53.590,1:15:54.590
Gir: [crosstalk] Hey, don't— give it a shot!

1:15:54.590,1:15:56.340
Wayne: That's not what I mean.

1:15:56.340,1:15:58.190
Gir: Maybe you have a good idea.

1:15:58.190,1:16:04.889
Trog: To generalize that advice, I guess what
I'm saying is don't be afraid to take inspiration

1:16:04.889,1:16:09.780
from other forms of media, as long as you
aren't like, [crosstalk] completely ripping

1:16:09.780,1:16:10.780
them off.

1:16:10.780,1:16:11.780
Gir: Straight copying it.

1:16:11.780,1:16:13.230
Wayne: Oh no, you can do that too.

1:16:13.230,1:16:14.230
Trog: Well...

1:16:14.230,1:16:15.230
Gir: What?

1:16:15.230,1:16:18.550
Wayne: One of my highest points from my campaign
is just making the final boss Geese Howard

1:16:18.550,1:16:19.900
[crosstalk] but changing his name to Swan
Howard.

1:16:19.900,1:16:20.920
Trog: Yeah, that's different. That's fine.

1:16:20.920,1:16:22.730
Gir: He means like, plot line and everything.

1:16:22.730,1:16:24.420
Trog: Yeah, and I mean maybe—

1:16:24.420,1:16:26.420
Wayne: Don't rip it off one-to-one.

1:16:26.420,1:16:30.730
Trog: I shouldn't say that, because I dunno,
maybe your players would enjoy just playing

1:16:30.730,1:16:37.010
the plot of something. But, I will say, definitely
don't be afraid to take inspiration from other

1:16:37.010,1:16:38.070
forms of media.

1:16:38.070,1:16:40.790
Wayne: And your Samurai Jack campaign, that
we’re playing right now.

1:16:40.790,1:16:45.210
Gir: This may shock you, but we took inspiration
from Dragon Ball a lot.

1:16:45.210,1:16:50.240
Trog: Which is really funny, because I actually
haven't watched the new Samurai Jack or anything,

1:16:50.240,1:16:51.520
I just had that show—

1:16:51.520,1:16:52.550
Baaulp: It was bad.

1:16:52.550,1:16:56.330
Trog: I haven't watched that show in forever,
I just had it on my mind, and I was like,

1:16:56.330,1:17:01.060
"I should make a D&D campaign where they're
in the future, and they have to go back to

1:17:01.060,1:17:05.780
the past." And so I did. And you can watch

Wayne: Buy it. Go there. Buy the domain for
us.

1:17:17.989,1:17:24.750
Log: Also, my last thing that I'm gonna say
for this. If your players don't know about

1:17:24.750,1:17:28.100
UA classes, if you wanna make things easy
for yourself, just don't tell them.

1:17:28.100,1:17:29.100
Trog: Yeah, don't tell them.

1:17:29.100,1:17:31.570
Log: Don't let them know about Artificer or
Mystic.

1:17:31.570,1:17:32.570
Trog: Yeah.

1:17:32.570,1:17:34.840
Log: [crosstalk] Like I said before, you gotta
let your—

1:17:34.840,1:17:35.840
Wayne: No, it's good!

1:17:35.840,1:17:39.730
Log: You gotta expect your players to just
do whatever. So, like, you gotta expect a

1:17:39.730,1:17:45.920
wrench to be thrown into any grand plans you
have. But if you let somebody play as Mystic

1:17:45.920,1:17:51.620
or Artificer Gunsmith, they will drive a truck
into your well-tuned machine, and you will

1:17:51.620,1:17:53.139
have to pick up the pieces.

1:17:53.139,1:17:57.830
Trog: Basically, the best thing you can do,
is read what your players can actually do

1:17:57.830,1:17:59.790
before you start planning things out.

1:17:59.790,1:18:00.790
Wayne: Yeah.

1:18:00.790,1:18:05.000
Trog: Because you could plan something out,
and have it completely fold because you didn't

1:18:05.000,1:18:11.870
realize that one of your magic users in their
party has like, some random spell that completely

1:18:11.870,1:18:14.880
ruins whatever puzzle or anything you have
planned.

1:18:14.880,1:18:19.370
Wayne: My favorite example of that was in
the Pathfinder campaign we played, Baaulp's

1:18:19.370,1:18:24.340
campaign, the very first one we played. Where
Baaulp had a maze, that was— wait, no no

1:18:24.340,1:18:25.340
no, [crosstalk] this was Trog's campaign.

1:18:25.340,1:18:26.870
Gir: This was our current one.

1:18:26.870,1:18:29.150
Wayne: No no no, no, this was Trog's Pathfinder
campaign.

1:18:29.150,1:18:30.150
Gir: Oh.

1:18:30.150,1:18:31.150
Trog: Mhmm.

1:18:31.150,1:18:32.150
Wayne: Where I played as a teleporting gnome—

1:18:32.150,1:18:33.200
Gir: Oh, yeah.

1:18:33.200,1:18:37.580
Wayne: The funny thing was, this was a little
bit into the campaign, this wasn't the very

1:18:37.580,1:18:42.370
first thing we did. So the DM knew that I
was a teleporting gnome, and still put a maze

1:18:42.370,1:18:46.370
full of mines, that I just teleported past
the entire thing. [crosstalk] It's that kind

1:18:46.370,1:18:47.370
of thing.

1:18:47.370,1:18:48.370
Trog: I remember that.

1:18:48.370,1:18:53.270
Log: Yeah, I tried to have a fight with a
superpowered satyr on a rooftop, but Wayne

1:18:53.270,1:18:58.310
picked Mystic, so he just, "Oh yeah, I jump
50 feet to the next rooftop and leave!".

1:18:58.310,1:18:59.310
Trog: Yeah.

1:18:59.310,1:19:00.310
Gir: Here's the thing, like—

1:19:00.310,1:19:01.699
Wayne: Hey, I thought that was a cool solution
to that fight.

1:19:01.699,1:19:02.940
Log: [crosstalk] I mean— ??? We made it
work.

1:19:02.940,1:19:09.110
Gir: If your major obstacle is a hole, don't—
make sure your people can't all just fly over

1:19:09.110,1:19:10.110
the hole.

1:19:10.110,1:19:11.110
Trog: Yeah.

1:19:11.110,1:19:13.489
Wayne: I mean, you can still have that stuff
too, [crosstalk] but make sure there's more

1:19:13.489,1:19:14.489
to it than that.

1:19:14.489,1:19:15.489
Gir: My point is—

1:19:15.489,1:19:16.489
Trog: Yeah.

1:19:16.489,1:19:17.489
Wayne: Yeah.

1:19:17.489,1:19:19.300
Gir: Double check that your obstacle and their
spells aren't, like, [crosstalk] obvious.

1:19:19.300,1:19:23.860
Trog: Lemme let you guys in on a little secret,
too. Anti-magic zones, counter-spell, [crosstalk]

1:19:23.860,1:19:25.070
and de-spell. Use those a lot.

1:19:25.070,1:19:27.090
Gir: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All that,
too.

1:19:27.090,1:19:30.480
Wayne: But at the same time, don't go crazy
with it, [crosstalk] because it's just kinda

1:19:30.480,1:19:32.719
bullshit if it's just like, "Nope, nope. No
magic here."

1:19:32.719,1:19:33.719
Trog: No, yeah. Yeah.

1:19:33.719,1:19:34.719
Wayne: Or at least give them a way to fix
it, [crosstalk] like, turn it off.

1:19:34.719,1:19:37.420
Trog: Use it in places that is appropriate,
I'd say.

1:19:37.420,1:19:39.881
Wayne: Alright, let's move on, next question.

1:19:39.881,1:19:45.460
Trog: Alright. Next question is... okay, well...
I see now, looking at this document further

1:19:45.460,1:19:51.040
down, that Baaulp did not actually put the
REAL names of the people, and instead but

1:19:51.040,1:19:55.469
the names that they are in Discord, which
everybody changes those constantly, [crosstalk]

1:19:55.469,1:19:57.660
so I don't know who this actually is

1:19:57.660,1:19:58.660
Baaulp: Aw crap. Sorry.

1:19:58.660,1:19:59.660
Trog: BEEF—

1:19:59.660,1:20:00.660
[1:20:00]

1:20:00.660,1:20:01.660
Baaulp: I just copy and pasted.

1:20:01.660,1:20:03.180
Trog: Yeah, I noticed.

1:20:03.180,1:20:04.180
Wayne: Beef?

1:20:04.180,1:20:05.930
Trog: Beef asked, "Favorite sword?"

1:20:05.930,1:20:08.620
Log: Gotta be rapier or cutlass. Easy.

1:20:08.620,1:20:13.739
Trog: Oh, so you're goin' like, g— [crosstalk]
I thought he was asking, like, specifically,

1:20:13.739,1:20:14.739
what is your—

1:20:14.739,1:20:15.739
Wayne: Sword style?

1:20:15.739,1:20:16.739
Trog: Like, if you— like... A sword.

1:20:16.739,1:20:20.960
Log: Well, like... how many different named
swords are there?

1:20:20.960,1:20:23.020
Wayne: Coolest sword: Cera Symmetry from Monster
Hunter.

1:20:23.020,1:20:25.760
Trog: That's a pretty good— that's a damn
good choice.

1:20:25.760,1:20:27.030
Gir: Fierce Deity Link's sword.

1:20:27.030,1:20:28.030
Trog: That's a cool one.

1:20:28.030,1:20:29.030
Baaulp: [crosstalk] Uh, do other—

1:20:29.030,1:20:30.030
Wayne: Fierce Deedee.

1:20:30.030,1:20:31.030
Gir: Deedee.

1:20:31.030,1:20:32.030
Baaulp: Do other types of things count? 'Cause
I'm gonna pick— I'm gonna be that guy, I'm

1:20:32.030,1:20:38.830
gonna pick swordbreaker. 'Cause I like the
idea of someone whipping out a dagger, and—

1:20:38.830,1:20:40.449
Imagine you don't know what it is.

1:20:40.449,1:20:42.150
Wayne: It's not a sword, sword's in the name,
[crosstalk] it doesn't make it a sword.

1:20:42.150,1:20:43.150
Baaulp: Swordbreaker.

1:20:43.150,1:20:44.150
Trog: I don't know what a swordbreaker is.

1:20:44.150,1:20:45.150
Baaulp: A knife is a small sword.

1:20:45.150,1:20:46.150
Wayne: I guess so.

1:20:46.150,1:20:47.150
Trog: I guess so.

1:20:47.150,1:20:48.150
Baaulp: So there you go. I'm that guy, I'll
break your sword, [crosstalk] and then I'll

1:20:48.150,1:20:49.150
stab you with a regular sword.

1:20:49.150,1:20:50.820
Gir: Good question. Next question.

1:20:50.820,1:20:55.310
Trog: No wait, I didn't do mine. Wait, did
everybody do theirs? I think— y'know, I

1:20:55.310,1:20:59.770
was thinking about it, and I had one in mind
until Wayne brought up Monster Hunter, and

1:20:59.770,1:21:03.350
then I was like, I think it's probably gotta
be just like— I dunno, it's been so long

1:21:03.350,1:21:07.070
since I've played a Monster Hunter game at
this point.

1:21:07.070,1:21:08.070
Gir: ???.

1:21:08.070,1:21:11.980
Trog: I say that, but it's literally been
like, 3 months. That's too long for me.

1:21:11.980,1:21:16.159
Wayne: Oh, you know what's also great? The
Nargacuga longswords. Those are awesome.

1:21:16.159,1:21:22.670
Trog: But, I think the concept of both the
Switch Axe and the Charge Blade are both really

1:21:22.670,1:21:28.179
cool. I'm really into weapons that can turn
into different weapons, so I think— I don't

1:21:28.179,1:21:33.460
know if those really count as a sword. I guess
at least the Switch Axe does, part of the

1:21:33.460,1:21:35.360
time, but it's probably gotta be that.

1:21:35.360,1:21:42.489
Log: If I have to give a named weapon, um—
You guys know Ike, he's in Smash Brothers.

1:21:42.489,1:21:43.489
Wayne: Mhmm.

1:21:43.489,1:21:47.800
Log: In the Fire Emblem games and stuff, and
the sword he has in Smash Brothers, his sword

1:21:47.800,1:21:53.211
is named Ragnell, and it lets him counter-attack
people from any distance. At least, I'm pretty

1:21:53.211,1:21:59.780
sure— well, at least he can counter attack
people from 2 spaces away. And that's great,

1:21:59.780,1:22:04.370
because all the wizards come at you with their
AI and they start fighting Ike, and then he

1:22:04.370,1:22:09.920
just slams them from 20 miles away. It's good.
[crosstalk] Aether's in that game, and it

1:22:09.920,1:22:11.154
makes him heal for as much damage as he does.

1:22:11.154,1:22:12.154
Wayne: Good sword.

1:22:12.154,1:22:13.154
Trog: Good sword.

1:22:13.154,1:22:14.154
Wayne: Did everybody give their answer? We
need more short ones.

1:22:14.154,1:22:15.154
Trog: Yeah, I think.

1:22:15.154,1:22:16.154
Gir: More short ones.

1:22:16.154,1:22:17.154
Wayne: I think everyone did it. Alright. [crosstalk]
Next question.

1:22:17.154,1:22:18.154
Trog: Alright, this is a short one—

1:22:18.154,1:22:19.860
Wayne: I have one I'd like to read too. I'll
do it at the end.

1:22:19.860,1:22:24.920
Trog: Next question is from Kappa Mikey who
asks, "What's your favorite Minecraft block?".

1:22:24.920,1:22:25.920
[crosstalk] What is it, guys?

1:22:25.920,1:22:26.920
Log: Diamond.

1:22:26.920,1:22:27.920
Gir: ???.

1:22:27.920,1:22:29.260
Baaulp: Yeah, if you say anything but diamond,
[crosstalk] you're wrong.

1:22:29.260,1:22:31.080
Trog: I think it's unanimously diamond.

1:22:31.080,1:22:32.080
Wayne: No, [crosstalk] my favorite—

1:22:32.080,1:22:34.600
Log: Yeah. I don't fuckin' play Minecraft,
it's diamond.

1:22:34.600,1:22:41.820
Wayne: My favorite Minecraft block is... bedrock.
'Cause you can't break it.

1:22:41.820,1:22:49.290
Trog: Oh... alright. Here is a question from
Unmistakably Crash Bandicoot, who asks, "What

1:22:49.290,1:22:54.090
video game do you think would make a good
movie, or at least a movie you'd want to see?".

1:22:54.090,1:22:58.280
Wayne: Dude, I want live action Kingdom Hearts
II. [crosstalk] That'd be the craziest shit.

1:22:58.280,1:22:59.380
Trog: Oh my god.

1:22:59.380,1:23:01.590
Wayne: Question answered. [crosstalk] Next.

1:23:01.590,1:23:02.590
Trog: Yeah.

1:23:02.590,1:23:07.900
Log: No video— What video game works as
a movie? What video game movies have been

1:23:07.900,1:23:09.630
good? [crosstalk] Have there been?

1:23:09.630,1:23:10.630
Trog: None.

1:23:10.630,1:23:11.630
Gir: Heavy Rain.

1:23:11.630,1:23:17.480
Baaulp: Because they always pick action games,
but those are structured in a way that you

1:23:17.480,1:23:24.000
can't really wrap them or fit them in a specific
2 hour narrative without completely butchering

1:23:24.000,1:23:30.280
them and having to do all sorts of weird things.
And video game movies have such a tinge to

1:23:30.280,1:23:35.889
them, like, if anyone says, "Oh, this is inspired
by a video game", that's pretty much a code

1:23:35.889,1:23:38.060
word for "guaranteed to be bad".

1:23:38.060,1:23:41.670
Wayne: Well, the thing is, you just have to
lay into that aspect of it. Like, the fucking

1:23:41.670,1:23:44.000
Resident Evil movie with that Wesker fight
at the end? [crosstalk]

1:23:44.000,1:23:45.000
Trog: Oh my god.

1:23:45.000,1:23:46.000
Wayne: That's the most amazing fucking thing
ever.

1:23:46.000,1:23:48.810
Trog: Something that just doesn't ever happen
at all in the games.

1:23:48.810,1:23:49.810
Wayne: Yeah.

1:23:49.810,1:23:53.770
Gir: I have one in mind where I know it would
be bad, but I'd still like to see them hurt

1:23:53.770,1:23:57.980
themselves try to make it. I'd like to see
somebody fumble over making a Fallout movie.

1:23:57.980,1:23:58.980
Wayne: Oh, it would suck.

1:23:58.980,1:24:00.040
Baaulp: Yeah, [crosstalk] that'd be so bad.

1:24:00.040,1:24:01.239
Gir: That would be like, the funniest disaster.

1:24:01.239,1:24:02.239
Wayne: It would be so bad.

1:24:02.239,1:24:03.940
Trog: Honestly, I thought you were gonna say
Half-Life.

1:24:03.940,1:24:04.940
Gir: No.

1:24:04.940,1:24:06.300
Wayne: Half-Life could make a good movie.

1:24:06.300,1:24:07.580
Baaulp: 'Cause, Fallout is a—

1:24:07.580,1:24:10.060
Gir: You give J.J. a few more years.

1:24:10.060,1:24:15.940
Baaulp: Even the first person shooter ones,
Fallout is like an RPG. Can you imagine seeing

1:24:15.940,1:24:22.830
a Fallout movie where some action dude, like
Baptista, is doing flips and shooting a laser

1:24:22.830,1:24:23.830
pistol?

1:24:23.830,1:24:28.260
Wayne: I think a Half-Life movie adaption,
I think that might be inevitable. I think

1:24:28.260,1:24:29.260
that'll happen.

1:24:29.260,1:24:30.260
Trog: [crosstalk] Maybe.

1:24:30.260,1:24:31.260
Gir: J.J. Abrams. already said he plans to
do it.

1:24:31.260,1:24:32.260
Trog: That's crazy.

1:24:32.260,1:24:33.260
Gir: That and a Portal movie.

1:24:33.260,1:24:34.260
Wayne: That could be really— [crosstalk]
I think both of those could make really good

1:24:34.260,1:24:35.260
movies.

1:24:35.260,1:24:37.380
Trog: Alright, a Portal movie sounds fucking
stupid. There's literally one character—

1:24:37.380,1:24:39.460
there's two characters in all of Portal.

1:24:39.460,1:24:41.780
Wayne: Wait, yeah. I just realized what Portal
is.

1:24:41.780,1:24:43.150
Baaulp: Portal is puzzles. It's puzzles.

1:24:43.150,1:24:45.960
Trog: Yeah, you cannot turn— [crosstalk]
let's make a movie out of fuckin' Poyo Poyo.

1:24:45.960,1:24:51.030
Wayne: It would be a completely different
thing, and I take back the fact that I accidentally

1:24:51.030,1:24:53.810
said that it would be good. A Half-Life movie
could be fucking awesome, I think a Portal

1:24:53.810,1:24:55.980
movie would be nothing like the game.

1:24:55.980,1:24:57.430
Gir: What about a Left 4 Dead movie?

1:24:57.430,1:24:58.430
Wayne: That would be generic.

1:24:58.430,1:24:59.530
Trog: Eh, I don't like zombies.

1:24:59.530,1:25:00.530
[1:25:00]

1:25:00.530,1:25:04.320
Wayne: I think one of the reasons Left 4 Dead
works is because it is kind of generic. It

1:25:04.320,1:25:06.420
kinda plays off just like a basic horror movie.

1:25:06.420,1:25:07.489
Gir: That's true.

1:25:07.489,1:25:10.780
Wayne: That's even how the levels start and
end, it's a movie poster.

1:25:10.780,1:25:15.630
Baaulp: I know there was a Ratchet and Clank
movie, but there was also supposed to— I

1:25:15.630,1:25:19.240
don't know if it ever got released, there
was supposed to be a Sly Cooper movie.

1:25:19.240,1:25:20.240
Trog: Really?

1:25:20.240,1:25:21.240
Wayne: [crosstalk] I don't think that's happened
yet.

1:25:21.240,1:25:22.240
Gir: Yeah, there was.

1:25:22.240,1:25:23.240
Baaulp: Yeah, there was a trailer for it as
some point.

1:25:23.240,1:25:24.240
Wayne: I think that's still in the works.

1:25:24.240,1:25:25.240
Gir: Yeah, I think that's still in the works.

1:25:25.240,1:25:26.710
Wayne: Or maybe the Ratchet and Clank movie
bombed and they cancelled it.

1:25:26.710,1:25:28.670
Baaulp: Well, the Ratchet and Clank movie
got like—

1:25:28.670,1:25:29.670
Gir: It did decently.

1:25:29.670,1:25:30.940
Baaulp: Yeah, I don't know how well that did.

1:25:30.940,1:25:32.340
Trog: Did that have theatrical release?

1:25:32.340,1:25:33.340
Gir: [crosstalk] Yes.

1:25:33.340,1:25:34.340
Wayne: Yeah. It was big.

1:25:34.340,1:25:35.340
Trog: Wow, I had no idea.

1:25:35.340,1:25:37.060
Wayne: It came out with the game that was
really, really good.

1:25:37.060,1:25:38.730
Trog: Yeah, the remake or whatever.

1:25:38.730,1:25:45.550
Log: Now that I think about it, I feel like
you can't really make a good movie with a

1:25:45.550,1:25:54.210
popular game, really. Half-Life might get
close, but name any popular game, it'll probably

1:25:54.210,1:26:00.670
be a bad movie, ultimately. Nobody's got a
track record with popular games being made

1:26:00.670,1:26:01.850
into good movies.

1:26:01.850,1:26:05.040
Wayne: The newest God of War could probably
make a cool movie, [crosstalk] considering

1:26:05.040,1:26:07.520
they tried to make it like a movie in some
facets.

1:26:07.520,1:26:09.820
Log: Maybe, but like, what's the point?

1:26:09.820,1:26:12.540
Gir: Uncharted. Uncharted would make a decent
movie.

1:26:12.540,1:26:13.550
Wayne: I would hate it.

1:26:13.550,1:26:20.341
Log: Hey, I'm not done! I'm not done. I got
my idea for a movie I'd wanna see. So, a movie

1:26:20.341,1:26:29.270
about any of the games from Failbetter. Failbetter
makes like, Fallen London, and Sunless Sea,

1:26:29.270,1:26:34.989
and Sunless Skies and stuff. And those are
just top-down games where you sail a ship

1:26:34.989,1:26:39.889
or fly a spaceship and stuff, and a lot of
the stuff transpires in text, and it's just

1:26:39.889,1:26:48.970
supposed to be a creepy game where you read
about weird creatures and strange places and

1:26:48.970,1:26:54.690
stuff. I think that anybody who takes the
time to make a movie off of that will be good,

1:26:54.690,1:26:59.030
because they don't have any stupid scenes
that they can just copy one-to-one. They have

1:26:59.030,1:27:04.851
to read to do it. So they'll have to make
something that's true to form, and would be—

1:27:04.851,1:27:10.650
it'd be cool to see the visuals of it, I think.
There's shit where like, "Oh, this is just

1:27:10.650,1:27:16.170
a weird log in space that people live on that
just grows fungus everywhere, and everybody's

1:27:16.170,1:27:19.820
covered in fungus. All the old people come
here to get covered in fungus."

1:27:19.820,1:27:21.239
Wayne: They love it. Alright.

1:27:21.239,1:27:25.530
Baaulp: Now, I just have one last note. I
like Log's idea, I think you just gotta get

1:27:25.530,1:27:29.600
weird. I wanna see— now that I think about
it, I have an idea—

1:27:29.600,1:27:30.600
Wayne: RUNESCAPE THE MOVIE.

1:27:30.600,1:27:33.980
Baaulp: A Katamari Damacy movie made like
the Godzilla movie. ???.

1:27:33.980,1:27:36.560
Wayne: That could be awesome.

1:27:36.560,1:27:40.120
Gir: Wayne just made me think, could you imagine
a RuneScape movie where you just see somebody

1:27:40.120,1:27:42.750
in the background shouting, "I WILL PAY FOR
A GIRLFRIEND."

1:27:42.750,1:27:49.010
Wayne: Yeah, you got a movie where the events
of the movie are a regular video game movie

1:27:49.010,1:27:53.000
script, it's just lofty and bad, but in the
background there's just a dude hitting a tree

1:27:53.000,1:27:57.300
the exact same way over and over and over,
[crosstalk] and he never moves away.

1:27:57.300,1:27:58.340
Gir: "2K for GF."

1:27:58.340,1:28:01.440
Wayne: And then occasionally the tree just
disappears, and he moves to a different one.

1:28:01.440,1:28:07.210
Log: Hey, I just gotta say, fuck Sword Art
Online. I've never seen a single episode of

1:28:07.210,1:28:14.840
it, but I fuckin' hate it. That shit's dumb,
right? They don't even have something on that

1:28:14.840,1:28:22.330
level, like buying gf or whatever, right?
They aren't with it, right? Has anybody seen

1:28:22.330,1:28:23.330
an episode of that?

Baaulp: No.

1:28:28.330,1:28:29.330

of that anime.

Gir: We don't watch garbage!

1:28:30.330,1:28:35.480
Log: It's bullshit. I remember— I've only
ever seen one or two episodes of .hack//Sign,

1:28:35.480,1:28:41.260
but there was a scene from the show where
there were just players pinned to a dartboard,

1:28:41.260,1:28:44.530
and they're throwing darts at them, and they're
like, "Hey, why are they pinned to a dartboard?"

1:28:44.530,1:28:50.010
"Oh, they did some packet editing to change
the color of their clothes." "Oh.", and I

1:28:50.010,1:28:54.020
just thought, "Alright, that's good, I like
that. [crosstalk] I'd much rather have them

1:28:54.020,1:28:57.550
buying gf, but still, that's something."

1:28:57.550,1:28:58.800
Wayne: That is pretty good.

1:28:58.800,1:29:00.470
Log: Fuck Sword Art Online.

1:29:00.470,1:29:06.881
Trog: Uh, okay. My answer is, I agree with
Wayne saying Kingdom Hearts the Movie. Live

1:29:06.881,1:29:15.110
action movie. I would see it day one, I'd
stand outside for a week. Beyond that, though,

1:29:15.110,1:29:19.920
I think Mario Bros., a sequel with all of
the same actors.

1:29:19.920,1:29:21.380
Gir: Like the dead ones, even.

1:29:21.380,1:29:22.380

Wayne: Necromancy.

1:29:24.380,1:29:25.380
Trog: CGI. [crosstalk] Carrie Fisher's gonna
be in the new Star Wars.

1:29:25.380,1:29:26.380
Baaulp: Hologram.

1:29:26.380,1:29:29.150
Wayne: No, necromancy. I think the CGI approach
is lazy, I think we actually have to bring

1:29:29.150,1:29:30.150
them back.

1:29:30.150,1:29:33.310
Baaulp: Did you hear that Carrie Fisher is
gonna be in the next Star Wars movie?

1:29:33.310,1:29:34.310
Wayne: Yeah.

1:29:34.310,1:29:35.670
Gir: 'Cause they had some of the filming done
already.

1:29:35.670,1:29:36.670
Baaulp: That's so... agh.

1:29:36.670,1:29:38.740

use it."

Lou Albano.

1:29:44.330,1:29:48.340
Trog: Alright, this one— I'm gonna make
a rule on this one, and that's; you only get

1:29:48.340,1:29:52.590
one chance to answer this question, and that's
it, okay? Are we all in—

1:29:52.590,1:29:53.590
Gir: Alright.

1:29:53.590,1:29:58.420
Trog: Alright, you get one chance to answer
this question. Cosmic Cow asks, "Favorite

1:29:58.420,1:29:59.850
clown name?"

Trog: You get one. You can't take it back
once you say it.

1:30:05.190,1:30:07.850
Wayne: You have to edit in dramatic music
for the silence here.

1:30:07.850,1:30:10.300
Trog: Yeah, put in the "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire?" music.

right now.

Trog: Yeah.

1:30:14.300,1:30:16.100

that we've seen?

1:30:16.100,1:30:17.100
Trog: No.

1:30:17.100,1:30:18.739

1:30:21.000,1:30:24.660
Trog: Alright. We'll see who wins at the end.

1:30:24.660,1:30:26.800
Wayne: Oh no.

1:30:26.800,1:30:28.400
Trog: This is really hard.

1:30:28.400,1:30:31.170
Wayne: What I wanna say might be funny, it
might not.

1:30:31.170,1:30:32.909
Trog: [crosstalk] That's the trick, man.

1:30:32.909,1:30:35.230
Gir: We'll cut it out if its not.

1:30:35.230,1:30:37.234
Wayne: I mean, do you wanna hear— I was
just like, thinking of nothing. Do you wanna

1:30:37.234,1:30:38.960
hear the first name that popped into my head?

1:30:38.960,1:30:41.520
Trog: I dunno, is that your final answer?
You get one choice.

1:30:41.520,1:30:45.630
Wayne: I guess so. It's gonna take too long.
I'll just say it, 'cause I don't even care.

1:30:45.630,1:30:49.219
The first thing that popped in my head was
Toffee King, Spitter of Acid.

very jovial, but...

1:30:52.510,1:30:55.830
Wayne: Exactly, and that's why I don't think
I like it.

1:30:55.830,1:30:58.469

[crosstalk] I just gotta go with one.

1:31:00.830,1:31:01.830
Baaulp: Zap.

1:31:01.830,1:31:02.830

Baaulp: Z-A-P.

1:31:05.830,1:31:06.830
Gir: Zap.

1:31:06.830,1:31:07.830
Log: Oh, Zap. Why did it sound like you were
saying Zack?

1:31:07.830,1:31:10.760
Baaulp: I dunno. 'Cause I have a nasally voice?
I dunno.

1:31:10.760,1:31:18.100
Log: Anyways, mine is DJ Caterpillar, [crosstalk]
and that's what I'm goin' with.

1:31:18.100,1:31:19.100
Trog: Pretty good.

1:31:19.100,1:31:20.100

1:31:20.100,1:31:25.360

I'm gonna go with... I'm gonna go with Dimmy

Trog: Dimmy Pickles.

1:31:30.360,1:31:32.090

you said only one, I have to break the rules.

1:31:32.090,1:31:33.090
Gir: No.

1:31:33.090,1:31:34.850

Wayne: It wasn't a clown name, I just said
some bullshit! [crosstalk] What clown's gonna

1:31:39.429,1:31:40.429
spit acid? You wanna burn those children?
You wanna ruin their lives?

1:34:06.000,1:34:08.690
Wayne: Who's eaten a TV set?

1:34:08.690,1:34:09.690
Log: [crosstalk] Someone has done it.

1:34:09.690,1:34:10.690
Baaulp: Someone ate a plane once.

1:34:10.690,1:34:15.250
Gir: Do you remember when you were in high
school, and someone would say, "Hey, dump

1:34:15.250,1:34:17.040
all your food into my plate, and I'll eat
it!"

1:34:17.040,1:34:18.350
Trog: What? [crosstalk] No.

1:34:18.350,1:34:19.989
Baaulp: No? Who did that?

1:34:19.989,1:34:24.090
Gir: It was like, somebody's soda, and macaroni,
[crosstalk] and a pizza, and fuckin' chips.

1:34:24.090,1:34:25.130
There was some kid that would eat that!

1:34:25.130,1:34:26.130
Trog: Oh, gross.

1:34:26.130,1:34:27.810
Wayne: What school of a zoo did you go to?

1:34:27.810,1:34:30.690
Gir: There was some kid that would just mix
a bunch of random shit, and they're like,

1:34:30.690,1:34:34.179
"If you give me $5, I'll eat this." That's
what I'd feed them.

1:34:34.179,1:34:37.940
Baaulp: Are you sure you weren't hallucinating
on a pig farm?

1:34:37.940,1:34:42.170
Gir: No! Okay, I guess you guys didn't go
to school with idiots like I did.

1:34:42.170,1:34:46.980
Wayne: One time I took an overripe banana,
and a little bit of milk, and some turkey

1:34:46.980,1:34:50.370
and cheese, and wrapped it up— and mushed
it all together, wrapped it up in a paper

1:34:50.370,1:34:54.020
towel, and I tried to give it to this kid
I hate and told him it was a cheeseburger.

1:34:54.020,1:34:56.190
Log: Oh shit, give them Bardonic ramen!

1:34:56.190,1:35:00.270
Trog: [crosstalk] Oh, alright. No way. That's
it. That is it.

1:35:00.270,1:35:02.639
Gir: Yeah! Bardonic— yep! Yep! Bardonic
ramen.

1:35:02.639,1:35:03.639
[1:35:00]

1:35:03.639,1:35:04.639
Log: Hey, for viewers—

1:35:04.639,1:35:05.639
Gir: We're not explaining it.

1:35:05.639,1:35:06.820
Trog: [crosstalk] We have some homework for
you guys.

1:35:06.820,1:35:09.389
Wayne: It'll be in the description, you have
to explain it.

1:35:09.389,1:35:11.510
Log: Bardonic ramen is blue like Sonic the
Hedgehog, bitches!

1:35:11.510,1:35:14.659
Wayne: What did he cook it in? Powerade? What
was it?

1:35:14.659,1:35:16.190
Log: Yeah, yeah, [crosstalk] it's Powerade.

1:35:16.190,1:35:18.090
Trog: I'm pretty sure it was Powerade.

1:35:18.090,1:35:22.179
Wayne: It's ramen boiled in Powerade, and
then I think he adds— what was the yellow

1:35:22.179,1:35:23.239
aspect of it, if it's Bardonic?

1:35:23.239,1:35:24.239
Log: Like a banana or something.

1:35:24.239,1:35:25.239
Gir: [crosstalk] The flavoring.

1:35:25.239,1:35:26.239
Trog: No, I think it was the ramen.

1:35:26.239,1:35:27.239
Wayne: Was it a banana?

1:35:27.239,1:35:28.239
Trog: I think the ramen was it.

1:35:28.239,1:35:29.239
Wayne: Oh no, it was the chicken flavoring!

1:35:29.239,1:35:30.239
Trog: Oh yeah, that's right!

1:35:30.239,1:35:33.280
Wayne: It is blue Powerade ramen, and he still
adds the chicken flavoring.

1:35:33.280,1:35:35.949
Trog: I'm pretty sure he puts sprinkles or
something on it, too.

1:35:35.949,1:35:36.949
Wayne: Yeah, something like that.

1:35:36.949,1:35:37.949
Log: Yeah.

1:35:37.949,1:35:38.949
Gir: He puts those ??? in it.

1:35:38.949,1:35:42.250
Trog: Anyway, go check the description for
that video and watch it so you can get this

1:35:42.250,1:35:43.250
joke.

1:35:43.250,1:35:44.250
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:35:44.250,1:35:46.500
Log: [crosstalk] Want me to tell them the
name of the YouTuber?

1:35:46.500,1:35:48.940
Trog: No. Pause the podcast, go watch that
video, and come back.

1:35:48.940,1:35:51.850
Log: Yeah, just look for Bardonic ramen. It's
available in all stores.

1:35:51.850,1:35:57.320
Baaulp: I was gonna say— I was gonna reference
this one time when I was a kid, when Sun Chips

1:35:57.320,1:36:02.320
first came out, I really liked them, so I
bought a huge bag of Sun Chips, I ate the

1:36:02.320,1:36:07.150
whole bag, it was like a party size bag. I
felt really gross and I vomited, I was gonna

1:36:07.150,1:36:10.560
make them eat that, but nah. It's Bardonic
ramen.

1:36:10.560,1:36:13.830
Trog: You can't make somebody eat throw up
as their last meal.

1:36:13.830,1:36:17.969
Baaulp: No, not my throw up! I mean, eat Sun
Chips until they threw up.

1:36:17.969,1:36:23.179
Trog: Eat Sun Chips! "What's the worst thing
you could give to your mortal enemy?" "Uh,

1:36:23.179,1:36:26.010
here's a bag of Garden Salsa Sun Chips."

1:36:26.010,1:36:27.300
Wayne: [crosstalk] But a lot of them.

1:36:27.300,1:36:30.840
Gir: It's cheating to say you'd give them
so much they puke, 'cause then you could just

1:36:30.840,1:36:31.840
say, [crosstalk] "Oh, I give them ice cream
until they die."

1:36:31.840,1:36:32.840
Baaulp: Yeah, your meal's the whole bag!

1:36:32.840,1:36:36.720
Trog: All you can eat slime. You have to eat
until they die.

1:36:36.720,1:36:37.720
Gir: Slime.

1:36:37.720,1:36:39.730
Wayne: Oh yeah, my last meal is Gak!

1:36:39.730,1:36:41.310
Gir: Play-Doh! [crosstalk] Play-Doh!

1:36:41.310,1:36:44.040
Trog: I'm pretty sure it's mostly corn syurp,
so...

1:36:44.040,1:36:45.270
Baaulp: Yeah, it probably wouldn't be that
bad.

1:36:45.270,1:36:47.481
Gir: [crosstalk] Make them eat Play-Doh.

1:36:47.481,1:36:49.650
Wayne: You probably couldn't swallow it! It
was probably too sticky.

1:36:49.650,1:36:50.650
Gir: Glue?

1:36:50.650,1:36:51.800
Baaulp: [crosstalk] We're going down a dangerous
road here.

1:36:51.800,1:36:55.060
Wayne: You probably couldn't swallow a wad
of corn starch, I think it's too dry, I dunno.

1:36:55.060,1:36:56.949
Log: Eat some lead pita chips.

1:36:56.949,1:36:59.940
Baaulp: Was that the last question or do we
have another question?

1:36:59.940,1:37:00.940
Wayne: [crosstalk] I have the last question.

1:37:00.940,1:37:02.190
Gir: Wayne's got the final question.

1:37:02.190,1:37:03.190
Trog: Alright.

1:37:03.190,1:37:04.190
Wayne: Alright, are you guys ready?

1:37:04.190,1:37:05.190
Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah.

1:37:05.190,1:37:06.190
Gir: Yeah.

1:37:06.190,1:37:07.190
Trog: Yeah.

1:37:07.190,1:37:09.650
Wayne: Alright, so, somebody joined our Discord
server last night, after the Pixel Ripped

1:37:09.650,1:37:14.270
stream. Their name is Little Green Man, and
the only thing they've done in the server

1:37:14.270,1:37:18.390
so far is go in the podcast channel and ask
this question, in all caps, "HAVE YOU EVER

1:37:18.390,1:37:19.970
BEEN CAUGHT ON FIRE?"

1:37:19.970,1:37:24.199
Gir: Yeah, somebody caught me being aflame
once.

1:37:24.199,1:37:28.790
Baaulp: Hey, I got you covered. The answer
is all of us, we're all dead.

1:37:28.790,1:37:32.900
Trog: Oh, [crosstalk] you weren't supposed
to say that 'till the season finale.

1:37:32.900,1:37:35.989
Gir: Okay, no, I can wrap this around to the
very start, [crosstalk] where I was not on

1:37:35.989,1:37:37.770
fire, but my friends bushes were.

1:37:37.770,1:37:38.770
Baaulp: Oh, do that.

1:37:38.770,1:37:39.920
Log: Well, who gives a fuck about that?

1:37:39.920,1:37:40.920
Wayne: Yeah?

1:37:40.920,1:37:44.699
Gir: His family, when they went outside and
saw their bushes on fire.

1:37:44.699,1:37:48.150
Wayne: That's like someone asks, "Hey, you
ever broken a bone?" "No, my friend did, though."

1:37:48.150,1:37:54.010
Log: There was somebody I knew that did a
fuckin' little stunt, where they would spray

1:37:54.010,1:38:00.180
perfume on themselves and then light it on
fire, [crosstalk] and then put it out.

1:38:00.180,1:38:01.180
Trog: What the fuck?

1:38:01.180,1:38:02.180
Log: Apparently it didn't burn them, [crosstalk]
so I guess that's okay.

1:38:02.180,1:38:03.550
Gir: It's 'cause it was burning the perfume,
not them.

1:38:03.550,1:38:04.550
Log: Yeah, yeah.

1:38:04.550,1:38:05.850
Gir: You do the same thing with alcohol.

1:38:05.850,1:38:07.460
Log: But yeah, that's what they would do.

1:38:07.460,1:38:10.020
Gir: I don't think anyone here has ever been
lit aflame.

1:38:10.020,1:38:11.730
Trog: No. I have not.

1:38:11.730,1:38:12.730
Log: Nuh uh.

1:38:12.730,1:38:13.730
Baaulp: No.

1:38:13.730,1:38:14.730
Gir: Kind of a weak final question there.

1:38:14.730,1:38:16.180
Log: Maybe we shouldn't have answered it.

1:38:16.180,1:38:17.340
Wayne: That was the point.

1:38:17.340,1:38:18.900
Log: Well, you should have told us.

1:38:18.900,1:38:22.389
Trog: You should have said, "Here's a question,
don't answer this one, though."

1:38:22.389,1:38:25.080
Wayne: Alright, then I have another one we
won't answer— [crosstalk] or we could, it's

1:38:25.080,1:38:26.080
up to you. Ready?

1:38:26.080,1:38:27.080
Trog: Alright. I'll try, I'll always try.

1:38:27.080,1:38:30.370
Wayne: This one is from... do you want me
to read the Discord name, because that was

1:38:30.370,1:38:35.160
what Baaulp was doing? Which is muscle emoji,
lip emoji, again lip emoji, thumbs up.

1:38:35.160,1:38:36.440
Trog: I think that's, uh—

1:38:36.440,1:38:38.280
Wayne: Its GrauBun, I know who it is.

1:38:38.280,1:38:39.420
Trog: Oh, yeah yeah yeah.

1:38:39.420,1:38:42.720
Wayne: This question is from GrauBun. "Credit
card number and social security number?"

1:38:42.720,1:38:44.219
Gir: Yes, you can tell me.

1:38:44.219,1:38:45.219
Trog: Ooh.

1:38:45.219,1:38:47.810
Wayne: Yes, please give them to us. Put those
in the Discord.

1:38:47.810,1:38:51.670
Trog: Yeah, if you wanna participate at home,
write your credit card and social security

1:38:51.670,1:38:53.040
number in the comment box.

1:38:53.040,1:38:54.040
Wayne: Down below in the comments.

1:38:54.040,1:38:55.040
Trog: [crosstalk] And leave it for me.

1:38:55.040,1:38:56.040
Log: Yeah.

1:38:56.040,1:38:57.040
Gir: Don't forget the security code!

1:38:57.040,1:38:58.710
Wayne: Also, I'll need your first name, [crosstalk]
and your last name.

1:38:58.710,1:38:59.710
Log: First name.

1:38:59.710,1:39:00.710
Trog: Just that.

1:39:00.710,1:39:01.780
Gir: [crosstalk] Your home address.

1:39:01.780,1:39:02.780
Log: First name, Tamers.

1:39:02.780,1:39:05.080
Trog: Your first name, your nickname, [crosstalk]
and your favorite flavor of ice cream.

1:39:05.080,1:39:06.080
Wayne: Your fun name.

1:39:06.080,1:39:08.650
Gir: If you're unfortunate and don't have
one of those funny plastic shopping cards,

1:39:08.650,1:39:11.250
go ahead and just— you can pay us and we'll
send you one.

1:39:11.250,1:39:15.449
Trog: Who needs those anymore? I can just
walk into pet stores and steal things.

1:39:15.449,1:39:17.739
Gir: I'll just squeak everything I steal.

1:39:17.739,1:39:20.460
Wayne: I think the concept of middle names
should be changed, and they should just be

1:39:20.460,1:39:23.290
called fun names. [crosstalk] Because nobody
uses them, they're just for fun.

1:39:23.290,1:39:24.290
Gir: Central names.

1:39:24.290,1:39:25.290
Trog: Can I change my fun name?

1:39:25.290,1:39:26.290
Gir: [crosstalk] No.

1:39:26.290,1:39:27.290
Wayne: Yeah, it's for fun.

1:39:27.290,1:39:28.290
Trog: [crosstalk] Can I change it to Dimmy
Pickles?

1:39:28.290,1:39:29.290
Gir: You can only do it for fun. You gotta
pick one.

1:39:29.290,1:39:30.290
Wayne: Yeah.

1:39:30.290,1:39:31.290
Trog: Sick.

1:39:31.290,1:39:33.150
Wayne: Alright everybody, well, thank you
for listening to The Podcast #1: The Future

1:39:33.150,1:39:38.151
of Podcasting, now The Past of Podcasting.
Tune in next time for The Podcast #2.

1:39:38.151,1:39:40.380
Log: I dare you to find it if you can.

1:39:40.380,1:39:44.780
Baaulp: Charge your phone, because our podcast
was so powerful, you probably have 1% battery

1:39:44.780,1:39:45.780
left. Go.

1:39:45.780,1:39:46.940
Wayne: It absolutely is, [crosstalk] check
your fuckin' batteries.

1:39:46.940,1:39:49.120
Gir: That was Baaulp hiding inside your phone.

1:39:49.120,1:39:54.800
Baaulp: I burst your battery open with my
sharp front teeth, and I suck out the power.

1:39:54.800,1:39:58.550
Trog: Should we plug the Discord or anything?
Or should we plug the stream?

1:39:58.550,1:39:59.550
[1:40:00]

1:39:59.550,1:40:02.881
Wayne: Absolutely. Look down below at the
Discord. It's in the description, you can

1:40:02.881,1:40:06.440
click the link, it's an invite link. You can
either join the Discord in your web browser

1:40:06.440,1:40:12.590
or in your programs. Also, check out twitch.tv/wayneradiotv,
the Twitch stream that this podcast is affiliated

1:40:12.590,1:40:16.530
with, where we play all kinds of fun video
games. I play them.

1:40:16.530,1:40:17.530
Gir: We're there too.

1:40:17.530,1:40:18.530
Baaulp: [crosstalk] I watch you play them.

1:40:18.530,1:40:20.599
Wayne: They're there, that's kind of just
the draw.

1:40:20.599,1:40:21.800
Trog: Yeah. That's it.

1:40:21.800,1:40:22.800
Wayne: [crosstalk] Sometimes we play them
together.

1:40:22.800,1:40:23.800
Gir: We'll be there.

1:40:23.800,1:40:25.610
Trog: If you enjoyed this, you'll probably
enjoy that. It's like this but somehow even

1:40:25.610,1:40:26.970
less coordinated.

1:40:26.970,1:40:29.869
Log: Also, check out One Piece. It's pretty
good.

1:40:29.869,1:40:34.730
Wayne: Check out logmore.tumblr.com for the
quickest art. I mean coolest art.

1:40:34.730,1:40:38.670
Gir: And because we're here at the very end,
I'd like to say, if you listened to the entire

1:40:38.670,1:40:41.430
thing, thank you. If you just skipped here,
go fuck yourself.

1:40:41.430,1:40:45.070
Wayne: No one— who skips to the last 10
seconds of a podcast?

1:40:45.070,1:40:46.070
Trog: I do.

1:40:46.070,1:40:47.070
Gir: [crosstalk] Demons.

1:40:47.070,1:40:48.070
Baaulp: That's the juicy bit.

1:40:48.070,1:40:50.620
Wayne: Buh, I wonder— I open up an episode
of my favorite podcast, "Mmm, I wonder how

1:40:50.620,1:40:51.620
the ended this one!"

1:40:51.620,1:40:53.869
Gir: They're like, "Oh, that conversation
was boring, let me see if they get onto something

1:40:53.869,1:40:54.869
different."

1:40:54.869,1:40:58.510
Trog: No, no, no, Wayne, you have it wrong.
You open up an episode of your least favorite

1:40:58.510,1:41:00.520
podcast and skip to the end.

1:41:00.520,1:41:03.930
Gir: "Yeah, fuck these guys! I'm just gonna

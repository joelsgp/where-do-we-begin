0:00:08.010,0:00:30.720
Wayne: Where do we begin?

0:00:30.720,0:00:31.760
My name is Wayne—

0:00:31.760,0:00:32.970
Trog: My name is Trog.

0:00:32.970,0:00:34.120
Baaulp: My name is Baaulp.

0:00:34.120,0:00:36.010
Log: My name is Log.

0:00:36.010,0:00:37.120
Gir: My name is Gir.

0:00:37.120,0:00:39.970
Wayne: —And this is the Where Do We Begin
podcast.

0:00:39.970,0:00:42.250
Your podcast, my podcast—

0:00:42.250,0:00:43.980
Log: Our podcast.

0:00:43.980,0:00:44.989
For everyone.

0:00:44.989,0:00:47.559
Baaulp: Anyone can make an episode of this
podcast, not just

0:00:47.559,0:00:48.559
us!

0:00:48.559,0:00:50.930
Wayne: We dump this shit in the Creative Commons,
I--we

0:00:50.930,0:00:53.760
haven’t monetized it yet, it’s up for
grabs.

0:00:53.760,0:00:54.809
It’s got potential!

0:00:54.809,0:00:56.210
Gir: It is… audible.

0:00:56.210,0:01:00.230
Log: This podcast is open source, so I’m
really expecting

0:01:00.230,0:01:03.360
one of you guys out there to add in online
play.

0:01:03.360,0:01:04.360
Eventually.

0:01:04.360,0:01:05.360
Alright?

0:01:05.360,0:01:08.330
Baaulp: Yeah, and there’s a—and there’s
a really nasty bug

0:01:08.330,0:01:12.170
where I sound super nasally, someone should,
uh, fix that.

0:01:12.170,0:01:13.189
Trog: And add wavedashing.

0:01:13.189,0:01:14.409
Wayne: Can we get widgets?

0:01:14.409,0:01:16.210
Can we get like, uh, like
Warframe drops—

0:01:16.210,0:01:17.830
Gir: No, that’s part of the past.

0:01:17.830,0:01:18.830
Trog: Nope.

0:01:18.830,0:01:20.760
Log: I swear I will install a bitcoin miner.

0:01:20.760,0:01:24.740
Trog: We should say this is, uh, the Where
Do We Begin

0:01:24.740,0:01:29.500
podcast, now with a new permanent home—well
not permanent, but a new home on

0:01:29.500,0:01:31.800
uh, what is—what is the URL, Baaulp?

0:01:31.800,0:01:35.450
Wayne: It’s called wayneradiotv.podbean.com,
and now I am

0:01:35.450,0:01:36.450
Baaulp.

0:01:36.450,0:01:37.450
Gir, chuckling: Thanks, Baaulp.

0:01:37.450,0:01:38.450
Trog: Alright.

0:01:38.450,0:01:39.450
Wayne: Yes.

0:01:39.450,0:01:40.450
Gir: Yes.

0:01:40.450,0:01:41.450
Trog: That’s part of the new change, is
that Baaulp is now…

0:01:41.450,0:01:42.450
new.

0:01:42.450,0:01:43.450
And sounds different.

0:01:43.450,0:01:47.270
Wayne: Baaulp, so where else can we find,
uh, Where Do We Begin and, our other podcast,

0:01:47.270,0:01:48.270
Do You Like Games?

0:01:48.270,0:01:50.659
Baaulp: Uh, we have an RSS feed now that you
can subscribe

0:01:50.659,0:01:55.189
to, and as of recording, we’re like, up
and running on Spotify.

0:01:55.189,0:02:01.869
I’m waiting on
Log to draw me a nice, uh, 1400x1400 square

0:02:01.869,0:02:07.510
pixel, uh, image that we can use ‘cause
apparently that’s a very strict requirement

0:02:07.510,0:02:08.510
for iTunes.

0:02:08.510,0:02:09.720
Wayne: Our listeners need those dimensions.

0:02:09.720,0:02:10.720
Trog: Yeah.

0:02:10.720,0:02:14.250
Log: Yeah, and I’ll get to that, but, today
I got inspired

0:02:14.250,0:02:19.590
to draw a picture of Akuma wearing a Nascar
jacket covered in Little Caeser’s

0:02:19.590,0:02:21.480
logos, so that’s what I’m working on right
now.

0:02:21.480,0:02:22.480
Baaulp: Okay.

0:02:22.480,0:02:23.480
Trog: Which is much more important.

0:02:23.480,0:02:24.480
Baaulp: Yeah, alright.

0:02:24.480,0:02:27.270
Trog: ‘Cause it’s relevant, as this—it’s—it’s
more relevant

0:02:27.270,0:02:29.940
than this podcast will be when you hear it
a month from now.

0:02:29.940,0:02:33.390
Wayne: Little Caeser’s is so much more important
to Log than

0:02:33.390,0:02:35.310
any of us and any of our needs.

0:02:35.310,0:02:38.340
Log: Yeah, if you’re a subscriber to Log’s
content, you

0:02:38.340,0:02:42.290
might even get the reference whenever this
comes out in 2019.

0:02:42.290,0:02:45.470
Baaulp: I had a—I-I had a disturbing amount
of Little

0:02:45.470,0:02:46.470
Caeser’s as a kid.

0:02:46.470,0:02:48.790
Wayne: I was about to say—yeah, Little Caeser’s,
I think

0:02:48.790,0:02:50.519
they’re like very close to death.

0:02:50.519,0:02:51.860
I think they’re on life support.

0:02:51.860,0:02:54.220
Gir: I’ve had them once this year, and that
was the

0:02:54.220,0:02:55.780
first time in eight years [laughing].

0:02:55.780,0:02:59.180
Wayne: When—When I moved to this town, I
noticed that, like,

0:02:59.180,0:03:01.480
five minutes from where I lived there was
a Little Caeser’s and I was like,

0:03:01.480,0:03:03.580
“Eugh, Little Caeser’s, I’m never going
to go there.”

0:03:03.580,0:03:04.580
[Bauulp laughs]

0:03:04.580,0:03:06.290
Wayne: And like a month ago I was like, “Y’know,
I don’t

0:03:06.290,0:03:10.790
have too much money, Little Caeser’s is
food, I think—I think it’s time.”

0:03:10.790,0:03:13.340
And I drove over there, this is after a year
living here, and I drove over

0:03:13.340,0:03:14.550
there and they’re just fucking gone.

0:03:14.550,0:03:16.720
And I was like, “Oh shit!

0:03:16.720,0:03:17.926
Did this
specific one close or did they just go out

0:03:17.926,0:03:18.926
of business?”

0:03:18.926,0:03:22.140
And I Googled it and
no, there’s like, a lot of closing downs

0:03:22.140,0:03:23.140
of Little Caeser’s.

0:03:23.140,0:03:26.659
Wayne: And I mean, it makes sense they—it’s
a bad model

0:03:26.659,0:03:27.659
for business, honestly.

0:03:27.659,0:03:29.630
Log: You know what’s the worst model for
business, though?

0:03:29.630,0:03:30.630
Wayne: What?

0:03:30.630,0:03:31.630
Log: Papa Murphy’s.

0:03:31.630,0:03:32.910
Baaulp: What the fuck is Papa Murphy’s?

0:03:32.910,0:03:35.250
Wayne: I don’t even know what—that’s—that
doesn’t exist in

0:03:35.250,0:03:36.250
my state.

0:03:36.250,0:03:37.310
That’s not a New England thing.

0:03:37.310,0:03:40.020
Gir: Papa Murphy’s is you—you go in there
and you’re like,

0:03:40.020,0:03:42.580
“I want this kind of pizza,” they make
it and they’re like, “Alright,

0:03:42.580,0:03:43.930
take it home and go put it in your oven.”

0:03:43.930,0:03:45.099
Trog: Yeah, it’s like a—a take ‘n bake.

0:03:45.099,0:03:46.840
Baaulp: Wow—they don’t even cook it for
you?

0:03:46.840,0:03:49.970
Log: [Crosstalk] They basically make microwave
piz—uh, well

0:03:49.970,0:03:53.680
not microwave, it’s like—they pretty much
make frozen pizzas for you, on

0:03:53.680,0:03:54.680
demand.

0:03:54.680,0:03:55.680
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] What?

0:03:55.680,0:03:56.680
Wayne: But it’s like a fresh oven pizza.

0:03:56.680,0:03:58.280
Trog: Yeah, it’s like a fresh—it’s not
frozen.

0:03:58.280,0:04:00.430
Log: It—It’s like, it’s like, fresh
frozen.

0:04:00.430,0:04:02.660
Wayne: I feel like that’s not a bad idea,
but I’d never go

0:04:02.660,0:04:03.660
there, is the thing.

0:04:03.660,0:04:07.000
Log: So the thing is that it used to be the
super economical

0:04:07.000,0:04:08.000
option.

0:04:08.000,0:04:14.510
It used to be… that—it’s the Papa Murphy’s
price was a lot cheaper, and

0:04:14.510,0:04:16.190
that stopped being the case.

0:04:16.190,0:04:17.190
And so I see—

0:04:17.190,0:04:18.190
Wayne: Now they’re premium.

0:04:18.190,0:04:20.340
Log: —As far as I’m concerned, Papa Murphy’s
is just a

0:04:20.340,0:04:24.970
landmark to know that I’m really close to
the neighborhood my grandma lives at.

0:04:24.970,0:04:27.650
Baaulp: Wh-wha-what-what’re they charging
for your pizzas if

0:04:27.650,0:04:29.210
they’re not even cooking them?

0:04:29.210,0:04:31.770
Log: You can get a Little Caeser’s pizza
for as much as a

0:04:31.770,0:04:33.080
Papa Murphy’s uncooked pizza.

0:04:33.080,0:04:34.400
Baaulp: Oh my god.

0:04:34.400,0:04:36.370
Gir: What, you don’t like eating uncooked
pizza?

0:04:36.370,0:04:38.400
Wayne: But I bet a Papa Murphy’s one would
taste better.

0:04:38.400,0:04:39.400
Trog: Yeah.

0:04:39.400,0:04:40.400
It’s gonna be better than a Hot-N-Ready.

0:04:40.400,0:04:41.510
Log: I don’t know.

0:04:41.510,0:04:43.080
Baaulp: But you’d have to cook it yourself!

0:04:43.080,0:04:45.860
Log: It’s like what’s the point if you
have to cook it yourself.

0:04:45.860,0:04:47.860
Wayne: I think it’s genius on their part
from like, an

0:04:47.860,0:04:51.509
employment standpoint, because at that point
almost—there’s like almost no

0:04:51.509,0:04:53.199
liability on the employee’s side.

0:04:53.199,0:04:55.100
It’s like, “Oh you burnt your pizza?

0:04:55.100,0:04:56.870
[Laughing] Alright, buy another one.”

0:04:56.870,0:04:58.000
Gir: Why’d you fuck it up, idiot.

0:04:58.000,0:04:59.180
Wayne: Can’t do anything else.

0:04:59.180,0:05:03.210
Trog: Talking about pizzas has reminded me
uh… of a question

0:05:03.210,0:05:07.139
I wanted to ask you guys, and this is like
a super specific question, but I had

0:05:07.139,0:05:09.120
it happen to me recently.

0:05:09.120,0:05:12.701
Has there ever been an eating establishment
that you

0:05:12.701,0:05:18.440
used to enjoy and go often, and then they
got like, a new employee who f—sucks

0:05:18.440,0:05:23.780
at their job, and, like, it has made you not
want to go back there—Has that

0:05:23.780,0:05:24.980
ever happened to you?

0:05:24.980,0:05:25.980
Gir: Absolutely.

0:05:25.980,0:05:27.640
Trog: Because that happened to me recently.

0:05:27.640,0:05:30.970
Wayne: It’s definitely happened, but, uh,
it didn’t dissuade

0:05:30.970,0:05:32.139
me enough from going there—

0:05:32.139,0:05:35.910
Trog: So there’s a place near where I live
called Pie Five.

0:05:35.910,0:05:38.700
I don’t know, do they have those where you
guys are at?

0:05:38.700,0:05:39.700
Wayne and Baaulp: Nope.

0:05:39.700,0:05:40.789
Gir: No, that sounds like it’s probably
your area.

0:05:40.789,0:05:44.340
Trog: Pie Five is like a chain where they
do—It’s kind of

0:05:44.340,0:05:49.190
like the Subway of personal pizzas, you go
and you say, like, “I want a sausage

0:05:49.190,0:05:52.789
and a pepperoni pizza,” and they make it
in front of you and they put it in

0:05:52.789,0:05:57.210
this oven and then five minutes later your
pizza is done and you can eat it.

0:05:57.210,0:05:58.210
Uh, used to go there—

0:05:58.210,0:06:00.789
Baaulp: That sounds like, uh—that sounds
like Blaze pizza

0:06:00.789,0:06:02.280
that I see popping up here in Boston.

0:06:02.280,0:06:04.140
Gir: Yeah we got—we got Blaze here, too.

0:06:04.140,0:06:06.510
Trog: Yeah I’m sure that there are similar…

0:06:06.510,0:06:09.199
similar joints
in other locations.

0:06:09.199,0:06:11.420
Around here, there’s just one called Pie
Five.

0:06:11.420,0:06:14.550
But,
can’t go to the one near my house anymore

0:06:14.550,0:06:18.750
because they hired a dude who does
not know how to make pizza, and the last,

0:06:18.750,0:06:22.810
like, three times I’ve been there
he’s been the only person behind the counter,

0:06:22.810,0:06:24.860
and he has just made horrible
pizzas.

0:06:24.860,0:06:29.290
Trog: Like, I’ve never seen somebody, like,
put so much

0:06:29.290,0:06:31.090
cheese on a pizza before.

0:06:31.090,0:06:33.099
And you would think that that wouldn’t ruin
a pizza,

0:06:33.099,0:06:37.750
but there’s definitely a level of cheese
in which a pizza becomes inedible, and

0:06:37.750,0:06:38.750
he has found it out.

0:06:38.750,0:06:39.750
[Wayne laughs]

0:06:39.750,0:06:40.750
Gir: Nice.

0:06:40.750,0:06:41.750
Trog: And will only give me that much cheese.

0:06:41.750,0:06:43.169
Wayne: He’s surpassed the slop threshold.

0:06:43.169,0:06:44.169
Trog: Exactly.

0:06:44.169,0:06:47.449
Baaulp: How much cheese is this dude throwing
on the pizza?

0:06:47.449,0:06:48.449
Gir: A brick.

0:06:48.449,0:06:50.110
Trog: Like, so much.

0:06:50.110,0:06:51.850
Like a mountain of cheese, it’s
ridiculous.

0:06:51.850,0:06:52.850
[Log laughs]

0:06:52.850,0:06:53.850
Trog: And it’s—

0:06:53.850,0:06:55.289
Gir: He just throws a whole damn brick on
there.

0:06:55.289,0:06:56.910
Trog: —It’s sad because I used to like
it.

0:06:56.910,0:06:58.560
Wayne: That’s just how he likes it.

0:06:58.560,0:07:01.490
His boss just tells him,
“Alright man, make the best pizza.

0:07:01.490,0:07:02.630
Make the pizza you’d wanna eat.”

0:07:02.630,0:07:04.740
And he’s
just like, in his head, there’s only one

0:07:04.740,0:07:05.740
word, “Cheese.

0:07:05.740,0:07:06.740
Cheese.”

0:07:06.740,0:07:07.740
[Wayne laughs]

0:07:07.740,0:07:08.740
Gir: Aw, man.

0:07:08.740,0:07:10.990
Wayne: As he dumps the entire vat of cheese
onto your

0:07:10.990,0:07:11.990
fucking pie.

0:07:11.990,0:07:14.509
Trog: Here’s the thing—so it’s a double
whammy because number

0:07:14.509,0:07:16.419
one, he’s not very good at making pizzas.

0:07:16.419,0:07:21.030
Which, you know, I can maybe
look past, but also, he’s the kind of person

0:07:21.030,0:07:25.870
who like, every time I went in, he
like, feels the need to make small talk with

0:07:25.870,0:07:26.870
me.

0:07:26.870,0:07:28.200
Wayne: Oh, this is the same story.

0:07:28.200,0:07:30.650
Trog: He’s like, “Ah you play any video
games?”

0:07:30.650,0:07:33.080
And I’m
like, “Yes, sometimes, I guess.”

0:07:33.080,0:07:34.550
Wayne: “Play any video games, turbo?”

0:07:34.550,0:07:35.980
Trog: This is completely unprompted, also.

0:07:35.980,0:07:40.360
I’m not like, wearing
any video merchandise, he just asks me this

0:07:40.360,0:07:41.360
apropos of nothing.

0:07:41.360,0:07:42.990
Baaulp: He can smell the games on you.

0:07:42.990,0:07:44.759
Trog: Yeah, he can smell it.

0:07:44.759,0:07:47.520
And he was just like, “Oh,
you—you play Fortnite?”

0:07:47.520,0:07:49.210
And I’m just like, “No, I don’t.”—

0:07:49.210,0:07:50.210
[Baaulp laughs]

0:07:50.210,0:07:51.210
Gir: I would’ve laughed.

0:07:51.210,0:07:52.210
Trog: It’s like—I don’t know.

0:07:52.210,0:07:56.150
It’s like every time it’s a
new awkward conversation and I suck at making

0:07:56.150,0:08:00.280
small talk already, so this… this
combined with the cheese mountain of pizza

0:08:00.280,0:08:03.440
that he makes for me every time—I’m
just like, I don’t even want  to risk

0:08:03.440,0:08:07.300
walking in there and seeing him behind the
counter, like.

0:08:07.300,0:08:10.690
I will walk in and
then do a 180 and walk out if I see him.

0:08:10.690,0:08:11.720
Gir: Ah, it’s a shame.

0:08:11.720,0:08:14.810
Baaulp: I’ve never had that problem, but
most places here in

0:08:14.810,0:08:17.710
Boston are like a revolving door, y’know.

0:08:17.710,0:08:20.530
You go in like a month later and the
people are—

0:08:20.530,0:08:21.629
Gir: Someone completely different.

0:08:21.629,0:08:22.629
Baaulp: Different, yeah.

0:08:22.629,0:08:26.139
Log: Yeah, I absolutely do not recognize any
employees at

0:08:26.139,0:08:29.830
any fast food place I go to, even if I go
to them a lot.

0:08:29.830,0:08:32.760
The only person I
recognize is the lady that’s always at the

0:08:32.760,0:08:36.159
Starbucks counter at my work.

0:08:36.159,0:08:37.959
I
always—I know that lady, that’s all.

0:08:37.959,0:08:38.959
That’s the only person.

0:08:38.959,0:08:41.339
Wayne: The people that I recognize at like,
food

0:08:41.339,0:08:44.540
establishments is usually not fast food places,
because, like, they’re so fast

0:08:44.540,0:08:48.370
and loose with like, hiring people at like
a Taco Bell or a McDonald’s, but the

0:08:48.370,0:08:51.080
McDonald’s I go to, I think they’re breaking
a labor law.

0:08:51.080,0:08:53.140
I’m pretty sure
they’re hiring like, a thirteen year old.

0:08:53.140,0:08:54.140
Trog: Oh no.

0:08:54.140,0:08:55.830
Wayne: There’s this kid, he’s so small!

0:08:55.830,0:08:58.589
And his voice
is—he sounds like-like a little boy, and

0:08:58.589,0:08:59.589
it’s ridic—like—

0:08:59.589,0:09:00.589
Gir: Gotta make those V-Bucks, man!

0:09:00.589,0:09:01.589
Wayne, laughing: Maybe!

0:09:01.589,0:09:02.899
[Trog and Gir join in on the laughter]

0:09:02.899,0:09:03.899
Trog: [Unintelligible]—A job!

0:09:03.899,0:09:06.470
Wayne: I could just be being mean, and this
could be an ad—a

0:09:06.470,0:09:09.890
grown man who—with a child’s appearance,
but this kid is—

0:09:09.890,0:09:10.890
Baaulp: He could be a gnome.

0:09:10.890,0:09:11.890
[Gir laughs]

0:09:11.890,0:09:12.899
Log: Do you want to buy a McGun?

0:09:12.899,0:09:16.290
Wayne: I’m so tempted to just say, “Hey
man, how old are

0:09:16.290,0:09:17.290
you?

0:09:17.290,0:09:18.290
I think they’re like, tricking you.

0:09:18.290,0:09:19.690
I don’t think you’re s’posed to work
here.”

0:09:19.690,0:09:20.690
[Gir laughs]

0:09:20.690,0:09:21.690
Trog: They’re paying him in Bionicles.

0:09:21.690,0:09:23.240
Baaulp: Hey, it could be the other way around.

0:09:23.240,0:09:26.190
I knew kids
who were definitely, y’know, fudging the

0:09:26.190,0:09:28.610
numbers on their age so they could get
jobs.

0:09:28.610,0:09:30.410
Wayne: At like, family owned businesses, though?

0:09:30.410,0:09:31.410
Like—

0:09:31.410,0:09:32.410
Gir: Yeah.

0:09:32.410,0:09:33.410
Wayne: That’s the thing—

0:09:33.410,0:09:34.410
Gir: That’s more likely.

0:09:34.410,0:09:35.410
Baaulp: No, I mean, like—I mean like Dunkin’
Donuts and-and

0:09:35.410,0:09:36.410
stuff.

0:09:36.410,0:09:37.690
Wayne: You have to show your fucking birth
certificate!

0:09:37.690,0:09:38.690
Like—

0:09:38.690,0:09:39.940
Trog, laughing: You don’t have to show your
birth

0:09:39.940,0:09:40.940
certificate—

0:09:40.940,0:09:41.940
Wayne: Are they—yes you do!

0:09:41.940,0:09:45.510
You have to show, like proof
of-like—like maybe not your birth certificate,

0:09:45.510,0:09:48.850
but I absolutely—like when I
went—when I worked at Taco Bell and I worked

0:09:48.850,0:09:52.730
at an agriculture store, I had to
show like, legal proof of my identity, which

0:09:52.730,0:09:53.730
would include my birth—

0:09:53.730,0:09:56.339
Gir: Yeah, this is a—you said this is a
family owned place,

0:09:56.339,0:09:57.339
right?

0:09:57.339,0:09:58.339
Wayne: No, Baaulp was saying Dunkin’ Donuts.

0:09:58.339,0:09:59.339
Gir: Ohh.

0:09:59.339,0:10:00.950
Trog: I mean, are fake IDs hard to get nowadays?

0:10:00.950,0:10:02.120
I never
owned one.

0:10:02.120,0:10:03.180
Wayne: I mean, I don’t know.

0:10:03.180,0:10:06.740
I think you can just order fake
IDs online, but if you’re gonna go through

0:10:06.740,0:10:11.270
the bullshit to order a fake ID
online to work at Dunkin’ Donuts—

0:10:11.270,0:10:12.990
Trog: To work at McDonald’s—

0:10:12.990,0:10:13.990
Wayne: Yeah.

0:10:13.990,0:10:17.459
Trog: Honestly, Wayne, with the stories that
you tell… about

0:10:17.459,0:10:18.740
where you are…

0:10:18.740,0:10:21.800
Your place of living sounds like an anarchist
zone, I think

0:10:21.800,0:10:23.540
everybody just breaks laws over there.

0:10:23.540,0:10:24.700
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:10:24.700,0:10:25.700
Wayne: Maybe.

0:10:25.700,0:10:27.140
Trog: Secretly living in an anarchist commune.

0:10:27.140,0:10:28.140
Wayne: I don’t know.

0:10:28.140,0:10:31.550
Have I talked about the-the heroin
couple on a podcast yet?

0:10:31.550,0:10:32.550
Baaulp: No.

0:10:32.550,0:10:33.550
Trog: I don’t know.

0:10:33.550,0:10:34.550
Baaulp: What?

0:10:34.550,0:10:35.550
Log, laughing: Probably not.

0:10:35.550,0:10:36.550
Gir: I don’t think you’ve told us, ever.

0:10:36.550,0:10:37.550
Wayne: There’s a couple that comes into
my store, both of

0:10:37.550,0:10:40.670
them will go into the women’s bathroom which
is just like a one-one person

0:10:40.670,0:10:44.810
bathroom, for like, ten minutes, and like,
I can’t say for sure what they’re

0:10:44.810,0:10:45.810
doing in there.

0:10:45.810,0:10:48.610
Who knows, maybe they’re just—maybe they’re
just really into

0:10:48.610,0:10:52.360
each other, y’know, maybe they’re shooting
up, I don’t know, I can’t say

0:10:52.360,0:10:53.360
for sure.

0:10:53.360,0:10:55.380
But one thing I do know is that after ten
minutes of a

0:10:55.380,0:10:59.100
bathroom session, they’ll go out and play
in the refill litter bin like it’s a

0:10:59.100,0:11:00.100
sandbox.

0:11:00.100,0:11:02.160
[Baaulp, Log, and Trog laugh]

0:11:02.160,0:11:06.370
Wayne: I don’t live in a bad-I don’t—I
mean, I guess

0:11:06.370,0:11:12.440
I don’t work—I don’t work in a bad spot
in Connecticut, but it, uh—

0:11:12.440,0:11:14.120
Gir: It’s not a good one, either.

0:11:14.120,0:11:15.120
Wayne: It’s weird.

0:11:15.120,0:11:16.510
Wayne: It’s—no it’s just, I don’t
know.

0:11:16.510,0:11:19.200
It-it might just be
the mass exposure to the people of a suburban

0:11:19.200,0:11:21.370
area, I think that’s a constant.

0:11:21.370,0:11:22.760
I think this is everywhere.

0:11:22.760,0:11:24.950
Baaulp: It’s definitely here in the northeast,
‘cause your

0:11:24.950,0:11:29.451
stories line up with the stories my friend
uh, tells me about working in a

0:11:29.451,0:11:30.451
liquor store.

0:11:30.451,0:11:32.459
Trog: Man, northeast sounds crazy, I don’t
know—I live in a

0:11:32.459,0:11:35.130
suburban area and I don’t see anything nuts.

0:11:35.130,0:11:37.110
Gir: I see that kinda shit where I work.

0:11:37.110,0:11:39.029
Wayne: Well you live in like, Vegas, that’s
even—

0:11:39.029,0:11:40.029
Gir: Yeah, but—

0:11:40.029,0:11:42.120
Trog: Crazy shit happens there, you just go
like, a couple

0:11:42.120,0:11:45.490
streets over and you can see like, people
running around in Sonic costumes and

0:11:45.490,0:11:46.490
shit.

0:11:46.490,0:11:47.490
[Wayne laughs]

0:11:47.490,0:11:48.889
Gir: My favorite is a guy getting his—he
was like trying to

0:11:48.889,0:11:52.070
shoplift and they’re like, “Hey put that
back,” and he sets it down like, “Oh,

0:11:52.070,0:11:53.200
don’t worry I’ll be back tomorrow.”

0:11:53.200,0:11:55.160
Wayne: Well pretty soon, Trog, you can get
that experience,

0:11:55.160,0:11:56.160
too, in theaters.

0:11:56.160,0:11:58.040
Trog: Are we going to talk about that?

0:11:58.040,0:11:59.990
Is that our segue to
move off of, uh—

0:11:59.990,0:12:01.170
Wayne: I mean it could be.

0:12:01.170,0:12:02.170
Trog: It could be.

0:12:02.170,0:12:07.889
We could be the twenty thousandth
podcast, probably, to talk about the mistake

0:12:07.889,0:12:10.803
that is the Sonic live action
movie that’s going to come out here in 2019.

0:12:10.803,0:12:13.120
Wayne: You wanna, you wanna talk about sickness,
instead…

0:12:13.120,0:12:14.120
Baaulp: Sure.

0:12:14.120,0:12:15.120
Trog: No?

0:12:15.120,0:12:16.120
Wayne: Well, I’m sick.

0:12:16.120,0:12:17.330
Gir: Let’s get down with the sickness, man.

0:12:17.330,0:12:20.019
Baaulp: Let’s talk about death and disease
as

0:12:20.019,0:12:22.930
a refreshing break from every podcast talking
about Sonic.

0:12:22.930,0:12:25.570
Log: I can tell you about… something positive.

0:12:25.570,0:12:26.959
Wayne: Do I sound sick?

0:12:26.959,0:12:27.959
Trog: No, you sound normal.

0:12:27.959,0:12:29.050
Wayne: Alright, good.

0:12:29.050,0:12:30.290
Chat… you’re not chat—

0:12:30.290,0:12:31.290
Trog, laughing: Chat—

0:12:31.290,0:12:32.290
Wayne: This isn’t my stream, listeners—

0:12:32.290,0:12:33.410
Trog: “This isn’t my”—this is recorded—

0:12:33.410,0:12:34.410
Baaulp: Hey, chat—

0:12:34.410,0:12:36.180
Wayne: Listeners, if you hear this stream
and you knew I was

0:12:36.180,0:12:37.380
sick—It’s not a stream!

0:12:37.380,0:12:38.380
Okay, my brain is sick.

0:12:38.380,0:12:39.380
[Trog laughs]

0:12:39.380,0:12:40.380
Gir: Holy shit, dude.

0:12:40.380,0:12:41.380
Wayne: I’m done with this one.

0:12:41.380,0:12:43.510
Log: It can be, whenever we make this podcast
open

0:12:43.510,0:12:44.510
source.

0:12:44.510,0:12:45.510
Wayne: I’m done with this one.

0:12:45.510,0:12:46.510
Trog: Yeah, this could be a live stream.

0:12:46.510,0:12:47.510
Wayne: Let’s talk about….

0:12:47.510,0:12:49.061
Whatever you guys wanted, and not
what I wanted.

0:12:49.061,0:12:50.061
Trog: Sonic?

0:12:50.061,0:12:51.061
Log: Bro, I can talk about something positive
instead of

0:12:51.061,0:12:52.440
something horrible and terrifying.

0:12:52.440,0:12:54.300
Trog: Alright, let’s go with that, I like
that better.

0:12:54.300,0:12:57.079
Log: You guys are familiar with a white elephant
gift

0:12:57.079,0:12:58.079
exchange, right?

0:12:58.079,0:12:59.079
Trog: Yep.

0:12:59.079,0:13:00.079
Gir: Uh, no.

0:13:00.079,0:13:01.079
Wayne: Mhmm.

0:13:01.079,0:13:02.079
I’ve done that uh, just once, but yes.

0:13:02.079,0:13:03.079
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:13:03.079,0:13:04.079
Wayne: You’ll have to explain it for Gir.

0:13:04.079,0:13:07.010
Log: A white elephant gift exchange is one
where you and a

0:13:07.010,0:13:11.370
group of other people all put presents in
a pile, they’re not aimed at anyone,

0:13:11.370,0:13:15.240
they don’t, like, they don’t have a specific
target, and you all just take

0:13:15.240,0:13:17.510
turns picking a random present from the pile—

0:13:17.510,0:13:18.510
Gir: Ohhh.

0:13:18.510,0:13:20.880
Log: —Opening it, and you, you get that.

0:13:20.880,0:13:23.320
Or you steal a
present from somebody else who has already

0:13:23.320,0:13:24.449
opened a present.

0:13:24.449,0:13:25.500
Gir: I did that once, I took ‘em all.

0:13:25.500,0:13:26.500
Trog: Yep.

0:13:26.500,0:13:28.399
Log: Yeah, you just go around in a circle
and you do that.

0:13:28.399,0:13:30.570
I
think I’m the first person ever to have

0:13:30.570,0:13:32.600
won a white elephant gift
exchange.

0:13:32.600,0:13:33.600
Trog: Uh-huh.

0:13:33.600,0:13:34.600
Baaulp: Oh shit.

0:13:34.600,0:13:36.730
Wayne: I won mine as well, I think, but I’ll—you
go—you

0:13:36.730,0:13:37.730
finish.

0:13:37.730,0:13:39.410
Log: Could you objectively say that you won
it though, because

0:13:39.410,0:13:40.410
I definitely did.

0:13:40.410,0:13:42.220
Wayne: Well I wanna hear yours and then I’ll
compare it.

0:13:42.220,0:13:44.800
Trog: Did you destroy all the other presents
so you’re the

0:13:44.800,0:13:46.040
only one left with a present?

0:13:46.040,0:13:48.279
Log: Okay, let me just tell you.

0:13:48.279,0:13:52.120
Uh, so the-the gift price
limit was $20, okay?

0:13:52.120,0:13:54.209
Wayne: You got a 20 dollar bill!

0:13:54.209,0:13:55.209
[Trog laughs]

0:13:55.209,0:13:57.580
Log: I was the last person to open the gift.

0:13:57.580,0:14:00.060
So, everybody
goes around, there’s one thing left, I pick

0:14:00.060,0:14:02.760
it up and open it—it’s a $25 gift
card.

0:14:02.760,0:14:03.760
[Gir laughs]

0:14:03.760,0:14:04.760
Trog and Wayne: Ohhhhh!

0:14:04.760,0:14:05.760
Trog: Somebody broke the rules!

0:14:05.760,0:14:06.760
Wayne: Okay!

0:14:06.760,0:14:07.760
Gir: Nice.

0:14:07.760,0:14:08.760
[Wayne laughs]

0:14:08.760,0:14:09.760
Log: One of the people from work just fucking
ignored the

0:14:09.760,0:14:10.760
rules and bought a $25 gift card!

0:14:10.760,0:14:12.430
Trog: Was that person fired immediately?

0:14:12.430,0:14:13.430
[Gir laughs]

0:14:13.430,0:14:14.470
Log: We did kill him.

0:14:14.470,0:14:16.520
Trog, laughing: Oh, well, okay, that’s a
little bit more

0:14:16.520,0:14:17.520
extreme.

0:14:17.520,0:14:19.300
Gir: Aw, I thought it was positive, what the
fuck?

0:14:19.300,0:14:22.480
Wayne: Well I mean, your coworker’s dead,
but twenty-five

0:14:22.480,0:14:23.480
bucks.

0:14:23.480,0:14:24.480
Log: Yeah, I didn’t get hurt.

0:14:24.480,0:14:25.480
Wayne: That’s… pretty good.

0:14:25.480,0:14:26.480
Trog: What was it a gift card to?

0:14:26.480,0:14:27.480
Log: Amazon.

0:14:27.480,0:14:28.480
Trog: Ah hell yeah, that’s the best kind.

0:14:28.480,0:14:30.730
Wayne: I gotta say, that-that man as an entry
to that game,

0:14:30.730,0:14:31.730
that was so lazy.

0:14:31.730,0:14:35.440
Oh, like, you’re s’posed to do something
interesting, like-like

0:14:35.440,0:14:41.510
if you had a $25 Amazon gift card, like, and
other people saw that, everyone

0:14:41.510,0:14:42.510
would just take it.

0:14:42.510,0:14:44.269
Like, that’s the whole point of the white
elephant, right?

0:14:44.269,0:14:45.579
‘Cause
they can just steal it.

0:14:45.579,0:14:48.529
Log: Here’s the thing, I fuckin’ won because
I was the last

0:14:48.529,0:14:52.870
person to open a present, and then the person
that was first—the person that’s

0:14:52.870,0:14:55.880
first always gets a chance to steal something
at the end because otherwise it’s

0:14:55.880,0:14:59.350
unfair for them—but the first person was
the guy who brought the gift card, so

0:14:59.350,0:15:00.450
he couldn’t steal it.

0:15:00.450,0:15:01.450
Trog: Ahhh.

0:15:01.450,0:15:02.450
Baaulp: Ohhhh.

0:15:02.450,0:15:03.450
Gir: Ah, nice.

0:15:03.450,0:15:04.450
Trog: Well he could have.

0:15:04.450,0:15:05.450
Log: That wasn’t what our rules are, though.

0:15:05.450,0:15:06.450
So he wasn’t
allowed to take it.

0:15:06.450,0:15:08.399
Wayne: And-and that’s the thing, I feel
like white elephant

0:15:08.399,0:15:14.160
is more interesting when you pick a gift that
has like, a—a versatile a, like,

0:15:14.160,0:15:16.290
attraction to it.

0:15:16.290,0:15:18.170
Like, some people will want it, some people
won’t.

0:15:18.170,0:15:20.430
Log: I bought the gift that I brought yesterday,
and I

0:15:20.430,0:15:25.130
bought it because it—I looked at the shelf
and it said, “Yogibo Grippibo” on

0:15:25.130,0:15:26.130
it.

0:15:26.130,0:15:27.130
[Wayne laughs]

0:15:27.130,0:15:28.130
Trog: Uh, what was it?

0:15:28.130,0:15:30.399
Wayne: I know what a Yogibo is, that’s like
a bean bag,

0:15:30.399,0:15:31.399
isn’t it?

0:15:31.399,0:15:32.399
Log: It’s… it was a thing that was—

0:15:32.399,0:15:33.399
Wayne: Is it like a grip toy?

0:15:33.399,0:15:35.410
Log: It was something that you wrapped around
your neck and

0:15:35.410,0:15:37.470
it held up tablets in front of your face.

0:15:37.470,0:15:38.470
Trog: What?

0:15:38.470,0:15:39.470
Wayne: Ohhhh—

0:15:39.470,0:15:40.470
Trog: Okay.

0:15:40.470,0:15:41.470
Gir: Ohh, that thing.

0:15:41.470,0:15:42.470
Trog: That’s pretty interesting.

0:15:42.470,0:15:43.470
Wayne: You bought that?

0:15:43.470,0:15:44.470
Log: Yeah.

0:15:44.470,0:15:46.230
I saw the name “Grippibo” on it and then
I bought

0:15:46.230,0:15:47.230
it.

0:15:47.230,0:15:48.230
Wayne: That’s—oh man.

0:15:48.230,0:15:49.230
That’s great.

0:15:49.230,0:15:50.230
That merchandising team
must have a lot of fun.

0:15:50.230,0:15:52.370
Trog: So I feel like we’re getting our-our
Christmas

0:15:52.370,0:15:57.580
nomenclature possibly mixed up, because, to
me, that’s like—the whole like,

0:15:57.580,0:16:01.399
“everybody grabbing a gift,” that’s
just called a gift exchange, and a white

0:16:01.399,0:16:05.949
elephant gift is specifically like—I’ve
heard white elephant referred to as,

0:16:05.949,0:16:08.829
“specifically getting like, shitty gifts
for each other.”

0:16:08.829,0:16:09.829
Wayne: Nah.

0:16:09.829,0:16:10.829
Trog: Like—like gag gifts.

0:16:10.829,0:16:12.830
Log: Nobody knows anything anymore.

0:16:12.830,0:16:14.760
They just pick a name
and go with it.

0:16:14.760,0:16:17.839
Like, I’ve heard a bunch of different names
for it, and I think

0:16:17.839,0:16:20.860
I’ve heard at least one racist name for
it, that I’m not gonna say.

0:16:20.860,0:16:21.860
Baaulp and Trog: Oh.

0:16:21.860,0:16:23.259
Trog: Well, let’s not talk about that one.

0:16:23.259,0:16:25.810
Wayne: My family’s tradition is called,
“The Gnome Blender,”

0:16:25.810,0:16:27.380
in which no one buys any gifts.

0:16:27.380,0:16:28.390
Gir: And we blend a gnome.

0:16:28.390,0:16:29.390
Trog: Nice.

0:16:29.390,0:16:31.360
Wayne: Oh no I don’t—I don’t know why
they call it that.

0:16:31.360,0:16:32.360
Log: Yeah, positivity’s over.

0:16:32.360,0:16:36.000
We can get into your-your
horrible, shitty, bad vibe space, now.

0:16:36.000,0:16:38.970
Trog: I don’t feel like there’s much to
discuss that

0:16:38.970,0:16:39.970
probably…

0:16:39.970,0:16:40.970
Wayne: Should I just cough into the mic?

0:16:40.970,0:16:41.970
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:16:41.970,0:16:42.970
Trog: No.

0:16:42.970,0:16:43.970
No, no, no, no.

0:16:43.970,0:16:44.970
[Log laughs]

0:16:44.970,0:16:45.970
Baaulp: Yeah, that would be—that would be
great—

0:16:45.970,0:16:46.970
Trog: No, no, no, no.

0:16:46.970,0:16:47.970
Wayne: I don’t want to get germs all over
my pop filter.

0:16:47.970,0:16:48.970
Trog: I think we should talk about the elephant
in the room,

0:16:48.970,0:16:49.970
and then we should leave it, which is—

0:16:49.970,0:16:50.970
Wayne: Is the white elephant.

0:16:50.970,0:16:52.100
Trog: The white elephant in the room—

0:16:52.100,0:16:53.300
Gir: We already talked about the white elephant.

0:16:53.300,0:16:55.000
Wayne, laughing: Have you guys heard of this
white elephant

0:16:55.000,0:16:56.500
gift exchange thing?

0:16:56.500,0:16:58.382
[Trog, Log, and Baaulp join in on the laughter]

0:16:58.382,0:17:00.680
Trog: The new Sonic looks fucked up and I
hate it.

0:17:00.680,0:17:01.680
That’s
it.

0:17:01.680,0:17:02.680
Wayne: Yeah.

0:17:02.680,0:17:03.680
Gir: Alright, movin’ on.

0:17:03.680,0:17:05.940
Trog: I just want that to be an available
opinion of mine.

0:17:05.940,0:17:07.850
Wayne: I mean we still haven’t seen its
true face.

0:17:07.850,0:17:09.000
Gir: Its true form.

0:17:09.000,0:17:10.000
Trog: It doesn’t matter!

0:17:10.000,0:17:11.280
Wayne: We’ve seen his legs.

0:17:11.280,0:17:14.270
Baaulp: Its face doesn’t matter because
they ended up

0:17:14.270,0:17:21.730
deciding to make a 3D humanoid Sonic, and
there’s no possible way to

0:17:21.730,0:17:25.699
make that attractive in any way, like, its-it
can only be ugly.

0:17:25.699,0:17:26.699
Gir: Yeah.

0:17:26.699,0:17:27.699
Trog: Yes.

0:17:27.699,0:17:29.870
I mean, okay, so at the time of this recording
there

0:17:29.870,0:17:31.770
are two pieces of media for this.

0:17:31.770,0:17:36.840
There is a silhouette poster, and then
there’s like, a bigger poster that’s like,

0:17:36.840,0:17:38.260
his fuckin’ dick POV—

0:17:38.260,0:17:39.350
Gir: Dick cam.

0:17:39.350,0:17:41.090
Trog: —over the Golden Gate Bridge.

0:17:41.090,0:17:43.049
Wayne: That shit—the calves fuck me up.

0:17:43.049,0:17:44.760
Those calves are not
good to look at.

0:17:44.760,0:17:48.010
Trog: No, so like, he has like, hairy human
legs…

0:17:48.010,0:17:49.010
I don’t
know.

0:17:49.010,0:17:50.010
It-it’s messed up.

0:17:50.010,0:17:51.010
Wayne: It’s weird.

0:17:51.010,0:17:52.910
Baaulp: Nintendo knew what they were doing
because when they

0:17:52.910,0:17:58.010
moved from 2D to 3D they kept Mario the way
he looked, but like, they fleshed

0:17:58.010,0:17:59.010
things out.

0:17:59.010,0:18:02.240
Sonic did not get that kind of treatment,
so when he moved from 2D

0:18:02.240,0:18:04.090
to 3D he looked like shit.

0:18:04.090,0:18:07.470
Like, let’s be real, he looks like shit
in 3D already

0:18:07.470,0:18:09.270
for the video games.

0:18:09.270,0:18:15.450
Here, they’re doing like a… weird… humanoid
Sonic with like, realistic fur…

0:18:15.450,0:18:17.270
This can only be a disaster.

0:18:17.270,0:18:20.980
Log: I think that Sonic looks fine normally—

0:18:20.980,0:18:21.980
Gir: Yeah.

0:18:21.980,0:18:24.690
Log: —I, for some reason after I saw the
movie poster, I

0:18:24.690,0:18:28.820
just forgot that there’s countless sources
of 3D Sonics for them to draw from

0:18:28.820,0:18:30.990
and they instead made a realistic version.

0:18:30.990,0:18:31.990
Trog: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

0:18:31.990,0:18:32.990
Gir: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

0:18:32.990,0:18:33.990
Wayne: Yeah.

0:18:33.990,0:18:34.990
Gir: That’s my major issue with it.

0:18:34.990,0:18:35.990
Trog: They made a new one, that’s the problem.

0:18:35.990,0:18:39.300
Wayne: Hey, do you think they’re gonna,
like, obviously the

0:18:39.300,0:18:43.220
community is going to voice the fact—and
they already have—that this is awful

0:18:43.220,0:18:44.220
and disgusting—

0:18:44.220,0:18:45.740
Log, laughing: Sega already voiced the fact
that this

0:18:45.740,0:18:46.890
is awful and disgusting!

0:18:46.890,0:18:47.890
[Wayne laughs]

0:18:47.890,0:18:48.890
Gir: Yeah.

0:18:48.890,0:18:49.890
That’s the biggest thing!

0:18:49.890,0:18:51.820
Is they admitted
beforehand like, “Yeah we made a change

0:18:51.820,0:18:55.919
to Sonic and Sega didn’t like it, but I
think it’s important that we keep this change.”

0:18:55.919,0:18:57.690
Wayne: But what I’m thinking—Do you think
they’re gonna pull

0:18:57.690,0:19:01.830
a Jared Leto and say like, “Oh no, that
was just a tribute.

0:19:01.830,0:19:03.840
The real Sonic
is coming soon.”

0:19:03.840,0:19:04.840
Baaulp, laughing: “This is a Sonic tribute!”

0:19:04.840,0:19:07.260
Trog: “This is a Sonic tribute, we made
him look like

0:19:07.260,0:19:08.309
a hairy man!”

0:19:08.309,0:19:09.360
[Log laughs]

0:19:09.360,0:19:13.090
Gir: Their-their reasoning is like, “Oh
it would look weird if a cartoon character

0:19:13.090,0:19:14.370
is next to real people.”

0:19:14.370,0:19:16.169
Like-like that looks better?

0:19:16.169,0:19:19.600
Trog: Yeah, as if that hasn’t been in countless
beloved

0:19:19.600,0:19:20.600
films.

0:19:20.600,0:19:23.800
Log, slow and drawn out: “Hey, gotta go
fast!”

0:19:23.800,0:19:26.900
Wayne: However, you can take that into consideration
and

0:19:26.900,0:19:30.800
make it not look bad—like case in point,
like I was talking earlier, I think

0:19:30.800,0:19:34.890
the idea, Gala—Guardians of the Galaxy is
very successful and I think they’re

0:19:34.890,0:19:38.250
trying to aim for like a Rocket Raccoon-like
character.

0:19:38.250,0:19:41.110
I mean, Rocket Raccoon
just looks like a rock—like, he looks like

0:19:41.110,0:19:42.110
a raccoon.

0:19:42.110,0:19:43.110
Trog: He looks like a raccoon.

0:19:43.110,0:19:45.240
Wayne: He just looks like a raccoon, but he
does have like,

0:19:45.240,0:19:46.470
anthropomorphic characteristics.

0:19:46.470,0:19:49.330
Trog: So, so here’s-here’s where that
falls apart, is that

0:19:49.330,0:19:52.030
Rocket Raccoon is a raccoon.

0:19:52.030,0:19:56.890
Sonic the Hedgehog bears no
resemblance to a hedgehog whatsoever and is

0:19:56.890,0:19:58.350
a hedgehog in name only.

0:19:58.350,0:20:01.690
Wayne: Now would you enjoy the Sonic movie
if it was

0:20:01.690,0:20:05.070
shot with real people, with Jim Carrey Eggman
and Sonic did not look

0:20:05.070,0:20:11.180
like Sonic, he looked like a Rocket Raccoon
style, just like a real hedgehog.

0:20:11.180,0:20:12.770
Small, that size, and blue.

0:20:12.770,0:20:13.770
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

0:20:13.770,0:20:14.770
Yeah.

0:20:14.770,0:20:15.770
Trog: So they’re trying to do half-and-half
is the thing.

0:20:15.770,0:20:17.530
They’re trying to do like, a fucked up—

0:20:17.530,0:20:19.380
Wayne: And that’s why you get an amalgamation
like—

0:20:19.380,0:20:20.380
Trog: Yeah, it’s not good—

0:20:20.380,0:20:21.380
Wayne, laughing: You get a monstrosity.

0:20:21.380,0:20:23.450
Trog: The other thing I wanna bring up about
those two

0:20:23.450,0:20:28.169
pieces of-of Sonic posters that are out is
that, unless I’m mistaken, the Sonic

0:20:28.169,0:20:30.950
movie takes place on like, Mobius, right?

0:20:30.950,0:20:32.230
Like, that-that’s been said.

0:20:32.230,0:20:33.510
Why is the post—

0:20:33.510,0:20:34.510
Wayne: Wait really?

0:20:34.510,0:20:35.510
Trog: Yeah!

0:20:35.510,0:20:38.640
That part was like, released a long time ago
whenever they announced that it’s like,

0:20:38.640,0:20:39.640
Jim Carrey and shit.

0:20:39.640,0:20:40.640
Wayne: Isn’t he on the Golden Gate Bridge?

0:20:40.640,0:20:42.539
Trog: Yeah no, that’s what I was gonna say!

0:20:42.539,0:20:45.840
Why is he on the
Golden Gate Bridge if it takes place on Mobius?

0:20:45.840,0:20:48.190
Wayne: I don’t know, maybe they’re pulling
some stupid shit

0:20:48.190,0:20:50.330
and it says like, “Oh, this is…

0:20:50.330,0:20:53.120
Mobius, the alternate universe… of Earth.”

0:20:53.120,0:20:54.120
Trog: Maybe.

0:20:54.120,0:20:55.120
Gir: “The alternate version of Earth.”

0:20:55.120,0:20:57.420
Wayne: “Where Sonic is real and nothing
else is different.”

0:20:57.420,0:20:58.420
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:20:58.420,0:21:01.280
Log: Do you think that Jaleel White is going
to bring out

0:21:01.280,0:21:02.990
his Sonic voice against hecklers?

0:21:02.990,0:21:03.990
Trog: Yeah—

0:21:03.990,0:21:04.990
[Wayne laughs]

0:21:04.990,0:21:07.330
Trog: —for sure, you know all of those Jaleel
White live

0:21:07.330,0:21:08.380
performances, I guess?

0:21:08.380,0:21:09.419
Wayne, laughing: Hecklers.

0:21:09.419,0:21:10.860
No, they heckle him in
public.

0:21:10.860,0:21:11.860
[Trog laughs]

0:21:11.860,0:21:12.860
Wayne: “Fuck you!

0:21:12.860,0:21:14.799
Why did you let Sonic Underground get
cancelled!”

0:21:14.799,0:21:18.230
Log: I can’t do a Sonic voice, but somebody
should try and

0:21:18.230,0:21:22.289
just put something together that’s just
a Jaleel White voice saying, “Hey, shut

0:21:22.289,0:21:23.289
the fuck up!”

0:21:23.289,0:21:24.460
Gir, impersonating Jaleel White: “Hey, you
guys need to shut

0:21:24.460,0:21:25.460
the fuck up!”

0:21:25.460,0:21:26.700
Wayne: You can’t do it—No one can do it.

0:21:26.700,0:21:29.140
Trog: Nah, that’s not Jaleel White, you’re—that’s
like Sonic

0:21:29.140,0:21:30.140
Adventure’s Sonic.

0:21:30.140,0:21:31.140
Wayne: Yeah.

0:21:31.140,0:21:32.140
Gir: That-that-that’s modern, yeah.

0:21:32.140,0:21:33.140
Trog: Yeah.

0:21:33.140,0:21:34.900
Baaulp: You gotta stretch it out like the
way Jared Leto

0:21:34.900,0:21:35.900
would say it.

0:21:35.900,0:21:36.900
Wayne, pinching his nose: You gotta—You
gotta pinch your

0:21:36.900,0:21:38.711
nose!—Ah I can’t even do it.

0:21:38.711,0:21:40.270
Trog: Jaleel White Sonic is like really nasally.

0:21:40.270,0:21:41.340
It’s
a-it’s a very nasally…Sonic.

0:21:41.340,0:21:42.380
Wayne: It’s very nasally.

0:21:42.380,0:21:45.500
Trog: And it’s because it’s uh, because
Sonic is actually—

0:21:45.500,0:21:46.500
Gir: Jaleel White.

0:21:46.500,0:21:47.500
Trog: —Family Matters.

0:21:47.500,0:21:48.500
They’re the same.

0:21:48.500,0:21:49.940
Gir, in a nasally voice: “You guys need
to shut the fuck

0:21:49.940,0:21:50.940
up!”

0:21:50.940,0:21:52.279
Trog: That’s the secret canon they don’t
want you to know.

0:21:52.279,0:21:53.850
Wayne: Where’s Carl in the Sonic universe?

0:21:53.850,0:21:54.850
Trog: He’s Eggman.

0:21:54.850,0:21:55.850
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Oh shit.

0:21:55.850,0:21:56.850
Gir: [Crosstalk] Ahhhh, okay.

0:21:56.850,0:21:57.850
Wayne: I believe that.

0:21:57.850,0:21:59.760
Trog: Welp, that’s all the—that’s-there’s
your Sonic Minute.

0:21:59.760,0:22:00.760
Gir: There you go.

0:22:00.760,0:22:02.890
Trog, laughing: Our weekly segment where we
talk about

0:22:02.890,0:22:03.890
Sonic.

0:22:03.890,0:22:04.890
Log: Yep, yep, yep.

0:22:04.890,0:22:05.890
Trog: Tune in-tune in next week.

0:22:05.890,0:22:07.710
Gir: In three months from now when we finally
make the next episode.

0:22:07.710,0:22:11.370
Wayne: Hey, so did you know that you can buy
a live chicken

0:22:11.370,0:22:13.330
on Craig’s List for fifteen dollars?

0:22:13.330,0:22:14.520
Baaulp: Yeah, I’m not surprised.

0:22:14.520,0:22:15.520
Why?

0:22:15.520,0:22:17.440
Wayne: For some reason, I always—in my head—thought
that

0:22:17.440,0:22:20.289
they’d be more expensive, but I guess it
makes sense considering you can get

0:22:20.289,0:22:22.590
some chicken breasts for like, a couple bucks.

0:22:22.590,0:22:23.590
Log and Trog: Yeah.

0:22:23.590,0:22:25.059
Log: You can buy a dead one for… pretty
cheap.

0:22:25.059,0:22:26.910
Gir; Yeah you can go to like a feed store
and get chicks.

0:22:26.910,0:22:27.910
Trog: [Crosstalk] I’m pretty sure—

0:22:27.910,0:22:28.910
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

0:22:28.910,0:22:30.400
Trog: —like, the sum of the chicken’s
parts is probably

0:22:30.400,0:22:31.990
worth more than the chicken itself.

0:22:31.990,0:22:33.740
Wayne: Shouldn’t life be more valuable?

0:22:33.740,0:22:36.840
Baaulp: Listen, I know we might have some
vegans and

0:22:36.840,0:22:39.779
vegetarians listening, I’m sorry, but like,
come on.

0:22:39.779,0:22:43.730
Chickens… chickens are the
food animal and they’re born of food.

0:22:43.730,0:22:44.730
They come from eggs.

0:22:44.730,0:22:46.440
Gir: They are born of an egg!

0:22:46.440,0:22:48.299
Wayne: I think we—yeah, that doesn’t mean
you eat snakes!

0:22:48.299,0:22:49.390
Unless you’re snake eater.

0:22:49.390,0:22:50.740
Baaulp: We do in China.

0:22:50.740,0:22:52.100
Wayne: [Crosstalk] I guess so.

0:22:52.100,0:22:54.730
Gir: [Crosstalk] Every animal is up-up for
grabs, dude.

0:22:54.730,0:22:56.360
Wayne: Every animal comes of food!

0:22:56.360,0:22:57.919
What the fuck are
you talking about?

0:22:57.919,0:22:59.690
Gir: That’s—I didn’t say that, you said
that.

0:22:59.690,0:23:01.680
Wayne: Cows are not born from eggs, but you
eat the cows

0:23:01.680,0:23:02.680
which they come from!

0:23:02.680,0:23:04.570
No, I’m not targeting you, I’m targeting
Baaulp.

0:23:04.570,0:23:07.410
Baaulp: If I eat a-eat a jellyfish, that doesn’t
come from

0:23:07.410,0:23:08.410
food.

0:23:08.410,0:23:09.410
Trog: I’m sure you could eat a jellyfish.

0:23:09.410,0:23:10.840
Gir: What the fuck is this conversation?

0:23:10.840,0:23:11.840
[Baaulp laughs]

0:23:11.840,0:23:13.260
Trog: This is a weird podcast now.

0:23:13.260,0:23:14.850
Log: You should eat the core of the apple.

0:23:14.850,0:23:15.850
[Baaulp laughs]

0:23:15.850,0:23:16.850
Wayne: How much would you buy a chicken for?

0:23:16.850,0:23:18.050
How much would
you pay?

0:23:18.050,0:23:19.050
Log: Uhhh…

0:23:19.050,0:23:20.050
I don’t want to buy one of those.

0:23:20.050,0:23:21.050
Wayne: What’s the value?

0:23:21.050,0:23:22.050
Gir: A dollar.

0:23:22.050,0:23:23.050
Wayne: I’d like a chicken.

0:23:23.050,0:23:26.120
Log: Sometimes I’ve had dreams… or just
like, just like

0:23:26.120,0:23:31.600
fantasies of having just a pet duck that roams
the house and is like a dog that

0:23:31.600,0:23:33.520
walks on two feet and quacks.

0:23:33.520,0:23:36.070
Wayne: Speaking of dreams, do any of you guys
have like

0:23:36.070,0:23:38.960
recurring stressful themes in your dreams?

0:23:38.960,0:23:39.960
Trog: [Crosstalk] Yes.

0:23:39.960,0:23:40.960
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Nah…

0:23:40.960,0:23:41.960
Every dream is different.

0:23:41.960,0:23:43.640
Wayne: I consistently—Not-I mean not every
time,

0:23:43.640,0:23:46.720
every dream is different, but like, it comes
back every once in a while.

0:23:46.720,0:23:50.340
For me, and this is one that just happened,
just before—I-I am sick today,

0:23:50.340,0:23:54.770
listeners, and just before this podcast I
was taking a sickness nap.

0:23:54.770,0:23:57.270
And during
that nap I kept falling back asleep into a

0:23:57.270,0:24:03.570
dream in which I had forgotten that
I had a pet opossum in a box also filled with

0:24:03.570,0:24:06.919
two hundred mice, and I
was—the entire dream’s plot was me trying

0:24:06.919,0:24:10.440
to figure out a way to put the whole
box in a bag before all of the mice could

0:24:10.440,0:24:13.930
run out, and every time I failed I
would just quick-load with a picture on my

0:24:13.930,0:24:15.050
phone, and that was the dream.

0:24:15.050,0:24:16.050
Trog: [Crosstalk] Nice.

0:24:16.050,0:24:17.050
Wayne: And it was-it was—No, it was terrifying.

0:24:17.050,0:24:18.050
Trog: Oh, okay.

0:24:18.050,0:24:19.050
Bad, then.

0:24:19.050,0:24:20.050
Wayne: There were mice everywhere.

0:24:20.050,0:24:21.050
[Baaulp laughs]

0:24:21.050,0:24:22.050
Trog: Well, that is unfortunate.

0:24:22.050,0:24:23.050
Baaulp: That’s very specific.

0:24:23.050,0:24:24.270
Gir: The most stressful reoccurring dream
that I have is

0:24:24.270,0:24:27.530
like, and you guys are gonna rail me for this
one but, I’m trying to go

0:24:27.530,0:24:29.500
fishing and somebody keeps bugging me.

0:24:29.500,0:24:32.110
Trog, laughing: That-that’s the most stressful
dream

0:24:32.110,0:24:33.110
you’ve ever had?

0:24:33.110,0:24:34.110
Oh my god.

0:24:34.110,0:24:35.110
[Baaulp laughs]

0:24:35.110,0:24:36.110
Wayne, laughing: You are a simple man.

0:24:36.110,0:24:37.110
[Gir laughs]

0:24:37.110,0:24:39.110
Log: Man you live the b-you live the best
life, don’t you?

0:24:39.110,0:24:41.330
Gir: You know how fuckin’ obnox it—obnoxious
it is?

0:24:41.330,0:24:45.470
Trog: Gir lives a stress-free life the most—the-the
like the

0:24:45.470,0:24:49.570
literal most stressful thing your brain can
come up with is just, “Aw man, I’m

0:24:49.570,0:24:51.140
fishing and this guy won’t leave me alone.”

0:24:51.140,0:24:52.140
Wayne: So what’s he doing?

0:24:52.140,0:24:55.010
Is he just like on the co-on the
shore just going like, “Hey!

0:24:55.010,0:24:56.010
Hey man!”

0:24:56.010,0:24:57.200
Gir: It’s always something different.

0:24:57.200,0:24:59.190
Wayne: Alright, yeah one time he’s just
going like, “Hey,

0:24:59.190,0:25:00.690
what’re you-what’re you fishing for?”

0:25:00.690,0:25:03.140
And then other times he’s throwing r-he’s
throwing rocks at me.

0:25:03.140,0:25:05.450
Gir: It’s not just a dude or something,
half the time

0:25:05.450,0:25:06.450
it’s something insane.

0:25:06.450,0:25:07.909
Wayne: It’s an eldritch force—

0:25:07.909,0:25:10.399
Gir: Sometimes it’s—someone is talking
to me, or like I

0:25:10.399,0:25:14.090
don’t have a lure that I need so I get lost
in a store trying to find a lure I

0:25:14.090,0:25:15.090
want or—

0:25:15.090,0:25:16.090
[Baaulp laughs]

0:25:16.090,0:25:17.090
Gir: —all the water dries up.

0:25:17.090,0:25:18.510
Trog: All the water dr—Alright, that one’s
pretty wild.

0:25:18.510,0:25:21.070
Baaulp, laughing: So you’re not even really—it’s
not even

0:25:21.070,0:25:24.770
like a mischievous force, these are things
you would have to do if you

0:25:24.770,0:25:28.080
went fishing anyways, like buying lures and
renting a boat.

0:25:28.080,0:25:31.080
Gir: Yeah, what if I went fishing and the
ocean was

0:25:31.080,0:25:32.080
gone.

0:25:32.080,0:25:33.080
[Log laughs]

0:25:33.080,0:25:34.080
Wayne: If I was Gir, having Gir’s dreams,
and I-and I dreamt

0:25:34.080,0:25:38.020
that I was wet in someone else’s car that
I didn’t know, and I was trying to

0:25:38.020,0:25:40.030
fish, I would probably be pretty upset about
it, too.

0:25:40.030,0:25:41.030
Trog: Yeah.

0:25:41.030,0:25:42.030
Nightmare scenario right there.

0:25:42.030,0:25:43.030
Gir: I got crumbs on my ass.

0:25:43.030,0:25:47.039
Trog: My stressful reoccurring dream is because
I was in

0:25:47.039,0:25:49.179
marching band for four years in high school.

0:25:49.179,0:25:54.580
Well, for reference, I haven’t
been in high school for… like, eight years

0:25:54.580,0:25:56.000
or something?

0:25:56.000,0:26:00.450
But, I still have
reoccurring nightmares where I’m like, on

0:26:00.450,0:26:06.190
the football field and like, I don’t
know what the music is because I haven’t

0:26:06.190,0:26:10.250
been in marching band for eight years
and I’m like running into people and fucking

0:26:10.250,0:26:11.250
the show up.

0:26:11.250,0:26:12.250
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

0:26:12.250,0:26:13.250
Trog: It’s not good.

0:26:13.250,0:26:15.120
That’s my reoccurring stressful dream.

0:26:15.120,0:26:16.440
Log: Uhh…

0:26:16.440,0:26:17.440
I don’t know.

0:26:17.440,0:26:21.250
I don’t want to get too focused on
dreams-talk, because I don’t know how appealing

0:26:21.250,0:26:23.390
that is to yonder folk.

0:26:23.390,0:26:24.640
Trog: Anything we say is gold.

0:26:24.640,0:26:27.059
Wayne: See, that honestly—so that is a legit—that’s
a thing

0:26:27.059,0:26:29.870
that goes around a lot, is like, I hear that
just different podcasts were like

0:26:29.870,0:26:32.909
if dreams come up people are immediately like,
“Alright, we have to stop.”

0:26:32.909,0:26:34.630
And
I understand the whole like, you don’t want

0:26:34.630,0:26:38.280
to be sitting there for ten minutes
explaining a very convoluted dream, but if

0:26:38.280,0:26:40.520
you can talk about it quickly there’s
no problem with it.

0:26:40.520,0:26:42.230
But if you want to move on, if you have another
great topic

0:26:42.230,0:26:43.679
for me, hit me with it.

0:26:43.679,0:26:44.679
Slap me with me it.

0:26:44.679,0:26:45.679
Gir: Slap me around a little.

0:26:45.679,0:26:46.679
Baaulp: Here’s what I think.

0:26:46.679,0:26:47.710
Fuck ‘em.

0:26:47.710,0:26:49.130
Fuck ‘em, we’ll break
all the rules.

0:26:49.130,0:26:51.270
Fuck you, uh, what’re-what’re-what’re
some—I don’t listen to

0:26:51.270,0:26:53.399
podcasts, what’re some people who have good
podcasts?

0:26:53.399,0:26:54.399
Log: Uhh…

0:26:54.399,0:26:56.980
Let’s see… we got Scissors and my Friends.

0:26:56.980,0:26:58.529
Baaulp: Scissors and my Friends, fuck you.

0:26:58.529,0:26:59.529
Trog: No.

0:26:59.529,0:27:00.529
No, no.

0:27:00.529,0:27:01.529
We can’t go down this hole.

0:27:01.529,0:27:02.950
Wayne: Masters of Music, hosted by Zarknon
the

0:27:02.950,0:27:03.950
Embarrassed.

0:27:03.950,0:27:04.950
Baaulp: Fuck—fuck him.

0:27:04.950,0:27:05.950
[Trog laughs]

0:27:05.950,0:27:07.179
Baaulp: We’ll-we’ll talk about dreams
all we want.

0:27:07.179,0:27:08.320
I got
dreams.

0:27:08.320,0:27:09.320
I want ice cream.

0:27:09.320,0:27:12.230
Trog: I got a topic that most of us here can
talk about

0:27:12.230,0:27:14.850
and is relevant as of this recording.

0:27:14.850,0:27:18.100
The new Smash Brothers came out and most
of us here have been playing it.

0:27:18.100,0:27:19.100
Baaulp: Not me.

0:27:19.100,0:27:20.100
Trog: Everybody except for Baaulp.

0:27:20.100,0:27:21.100
[Baaulp sighs]

0:27:21.100,0:27:24.640
Trog: And we’re definitely some kind of
video game podcast,

0:27:24.640,0:27:27.120
so I’d say we’re somewhat equipped to
talk about that game.

0:27:27.120,0:27:30.520
Wayne: I think everyone in this call except
for… uh, Gir,

0:27:30.520,0:27:32.140
shares the same opinion on it.

0:27:32.140,0:27:33.140
Trog: Probably.

0:27:33.140,0:27:34.140
Gir: It’s fun and I enjoy it.

0:27:34.140,0:27:38.330
Wayne: It is somewhat fun, but the problems
that it has are

0:27:38.330,0:27:41.730
extremely hindering to my full enjoyment of
the game.

0:27:41.730,0:27:42.730
Trog and Log: Yeah.

0:27:42.730,0:27:44.330
Log: They keep fucking around with online
play and really

0:27:44.330,0:27:46.970
they should just stick with something that
works.

0:27:46.970,0:27:50.820
It’s Bandai Namco, they have
a lot of experience making games that are

0:27:50.820,0:27:53.429
just all about snappy online play.

0:27:53.429,0:27:58.330
They have Tekken, they have Soul Caliber,
they sort of have Dragon Ball

0:27:58.330,0:28:00.180
FighterZ, technically.

0:28:00.180,0:28:02.419
Arc System Works developed that but Bandai
Namco—

0:28:02.419,0:28:04.250
Wayne: They definitely did the netcode, though.

0:28:04.250,0:28:05.250
Not Bamco.

0:28:05.250,0:28:08.990
Log: Bandai Namco owns all those IPs and whatever,
but

0:28:08.990,0:28:12.570
anyways, they have experience and they just
fuck it up every time.

0:28:12.570,0:28:13.600
And they
really…

0:28:13.600,0:28:15.289
make me… wanna start punching.

0:28:15.289,0:28:16.289
Trog: Yeah.

0:28:16.289,0:28:17.289
[Wayne laughs]

0:28:17.289,0:28:18.289
Gir: They make me wanna smash a bro.

0:28:18.289,0:28:19.450
Wayne: Well yeah, then start uh, go play Smash.

0:28:19.450,0:28:21.690
Trog: That really what it comes down to, because
my history

0:28:21.690,0:28:27.660
in Smash is I liked the first two, and I liked
Brawl for a while, but then it

0:28:27.660,0:28:28.660
got boring.

0:28:28.660,0:28:31.730
I didn’t really get into 4 because I didn’t
like how it played, and

0:28:31.730,0:28:35.980
I feel like this one is—I’m not crazy,
I know that they’re never going to make

0:28:35.980,0:28:38.059
another Melee, it’s not gonna happen.

0:28:38.059,0:28:42.350
So this one, seems to be like a
lot of fun considering the fact that it’s

0:28:42.350,0:28:48.330
not another Melee, but the online is so
bad, that all you can do is play the single

0:28:48.330,0:28:50.620
player or play in person.

0:28:50.620,0:28:52.420
Wayne: And that is the ultimate sin.

0:28:52.420,0:28:56.790
It—yeah… the online—I-lots
of people are doing it, and I don’t understand

0:28:56.790,0:28:57.790
how.

0:28:57.790,0:28:59.910
Even-even with the ethernet
adapter I hear it’s still pretty bad.

0:28:59.910,0:29:02.080
Log: Yeah, we should take this time to talk
shit about

0:29:02.080,0:29:05.080
Bandai Namco ‘cause they’re doing everybody
a disservice.

0:29:05.080,0:29:06.080
[Trog laughs]

0:29:06.080,0:29:09.159
Log: So, Smash Brothers online sucks, Tekken
World Tour

0:29:09.159,0:29:11.970
prize money sucks, let’s talk about that
one, too.

0:29:11.970,0:29:12.970
Trog: Yeah.

0:29:12.970,0:29:13.970
Wayne: How much was that again, Log?

0:29:13.970,0:29:17.210
Log: So the winner of the Tekken World Tour,
and just to

0:29:17.210,0:29:19.890
preface this for people who don’t know about
Tekken and fighting game

0:29:19.890,0:29:23.480
tournaments and stuff, to qualify for the
Tekken World Tour you have to be in

0:29:23.480,0:29:30.490
the, like, top 20 ranks and their tour points
rankings, and to do that you have

0:29:30.490,0:29:34.140
to win tournaments all over the world, they’re
not segregated by region or

0:29:34.140,0:29:35.140
anything.

0:29:35.140,0:29:38.000
If you’re from Korea, you need to fly over
every continent in the

0:29:38.000,0:29:42.480
entire planet and win tournaments everywhere
to qualify for the tournament.

0:29:42.480,0:29:46.230
And
so, people did it, a Korean guy won, he won

0:29:46.230,0:29:47.900
seven thousand five hundred dollars.

0:29:47.900,0:29:49.929
Trog: For the record, that’s nothing.

0:29:49.929,0:29:53.760
Log: To further elaborate on that, so yes,
seven thousand

0:29:53.760,0:29:56.890
five hundred dollars is nothing for something
that culminated over the course

0:29:56.890,0:29:57.890
of a year.

0:29:57.890,0:30:00.510
His sponsorship immediately collapsed afterwards
because they

0:30:00.510,0:30:01.510
couldn’t make any money.

0:30:01.510,0:30:03.370
Wayne: Yeah, the guy who won got dropped.

0:30:03.370,0:30:06.530
Log: The sponsored players of that sponsor
we’re just the

0:30:06.530,0:30:10.029
guy that won in the tour tournament and the
guy that won Evo, so.

0:30:10.029,0:30:12.580
Trog: The two biggest possible tournaments.

0:30:12.580,0:30:15.260
Log: The two biggest winners of 2018 and then
the

0:30:15.260,0:30:16.260
sponsor caved in.

0:30:16.260,0:30:17.260
Trog: Yeah.

0:30:17.260,0:30:22.250
Log: Just another comparison, in 2006, the
winner of the

0:30:22.250,0:30:27.179
United States rock paper scissors tournament
got what, fifty thousand dollars?

0:30:27.179,0:30:28.470
Trog: Fifty thousand dollars.

0:30:28.470,0:30:30.340
Wayne: That was like, that was also 2006—

0:30:30.340,0:30:31.340
Trog: Yeah.

0:30:31.340,0:30:35.160
Wayne: —so, accounting for inflation, that
was a lot more

0:30:35.160,0:30:36.690
than the Tekken World Tour winner.

0:30:36.690,0:30:40.060
Trog: Bamco is… it’s-they’re sending
some mixed messages

0:30:40.060,0:30:44.060
because on one hand they are still doing the
Tekken World Tour.

0:30:44.060,0:30:46.920
They’re
still like, supporting the game in the way

0:30:46.920,0:30:53.500
that they are creating these events
and avenues where people can compete, but,

0:30:53.500,0:30:58.299
the problem is, is that they’re
putting so little money into it outside of

0:30:58.299,0:31:03.120
hosting the events that nobody can
afford to play Tekken professionally.

0:31:03.120,0:31:07.400
All of the biggest Tekken players pretty
much have gotten dropped from their sponsors

0:31:07.400,0:31:08.400
at this point.

0:31:08.400,0:31:09.400
Wayne: It’s ridiculous.

0:31:09.400,0:31:11.299
The game is pretty popular for a
fighting game—

0:31:11.299,0:31:12.299
Trog: Yeah.

0:31:12.299,0:31:13.750
Wayne: —It’s-it’s no Street Fighter
V, it’s pretty popular,

0:31:13.750,0:31:17.330
but they’re not putting the money into it
that they need—like, how much money

0:31:17.330,0:31:19.059
are Street Fighter V’s winners making?

0:31:19.059,0:31:20.059
Trog: Hundreds of thousands.

0:31:20.059,0:31:21.380
Log: Yeah, hundred thousands.

0:31:21.380,0:31:22.460
Wayne: It—That’s fucking unacceptable.

0:31:22.460,0:31:23.460
Log: Yeah.

0:31:23.460,0:31:24.510
Wayne: Someone needs to kick their ass.

0:31:24.510,0:31:27.169
Log: Tekken 7 I think is the best selling
fighting game of

0:31:27.169,0:31:31.039
this generation, and it’s owned by the people
that own the video game

0:31:31.039,0:31:34.169
production rights to One Piece and Dragon
Ball Z, so…

0:31:34.169,0:31:37.510
They c-they can afford to boost it, they just
don’t.

0:31:37.510,0:31:40.809
Wayne: Kick Bandai Namco’s collective ass
and make the money

0:31:40.809,0:31:41.809
fall out.

0:31:41.809,0:31:43.620
Log: Let’s see what they show us in January,
they’re

0:31:43.620,0:31:46.409
probably going to start the new Tekken World
Tour by then.

0:31:46.409,0:31:48.630
Trog: Is Tekken more popular than…

0:31:48.630,0:31:52.059
‘Cause in my head I was
thinking Tekken is probably third place in

0:31:52.059,0:31:56.080
popularity behind Dragon Ball
FighterZ and Street Fighter V.

0:31:56.080,0:31:57.860
Wayne: Is FighterZ the most popular right
now?

0:31:57.860,0:31:58.860
Trog: In my head it is?

0:31:58.860,0:32:00.650
But I don’t actually know if that’s
true or not.

0:32:00.650,0:32:03.429
Log: When it comes to tournament scenes yeah,
those have bigger

0:32:03.429,0:32:07.890
numbers, but in terms of like, just people
buying the game and playing it,

0:32:07.890,0:32:13.049
Tekken I think has the highest reports on
that, and it’s consistently played in

0:32:13.049,0:32:14.990
all platforms, y’know.

0:32:14.990,0:32:18.230
I think it’s a very popular game, and yeah,
they’re

0:32:18.230,0:32:21.019
just-they’re just being stingy little goblins
over there.

0:32:21.019,0:32:24.250
Trog: So go write to your local representative
and demand

0:32:24.250,0:32:26.550
that Bamcai—Bam-Bamgo… make more money.

0:32:26.550,0:32:28.200
Gir: Bamguy Bamgo.

0:32:28.200,0:32:32.710
Log: Let’s exterminate the Bamcai, let’s-let’s
capture them

0:32:32.710,0:32:35.340
and put them in-put them in video game prison.

0:32:35.340,0:32:37.771
Baaulp: The thing is this, like, what-what
is their

0:32:37.771,0:32:38.771
structure like?

0:32:38.771,0:32:41.260
Aren’t there outside tournaments?

0:32:41.260,0:32:43.250
Like is Evo a part of the
Tekken World Tour?

0:32:43.250,0:32:44.350
Like how’s that-how’s this work?

0:32:44.350,0:32:45.350
Log: No, it’s not.

0:32:45.350,0:32:46.730
I don’t want to get into it.

0:32:46.730,0:32:48.880
Trog: We could talk an entire episode about
this if we

0:32:48.880,0:32:49.880
wanted to, but—

0:32:49.880,0:32:52.330
Wayne: Yes, we’re not a fighting game podcast,
and those who

0:32:52.330,0:32:54.210
don’t really know about it aren’t going
to enjoy it.

0:32:54.210,0:32:55.210
Trog: No.

0:32:55.210,0:32:56.210
But this is the Fighting Game Minute—

0:32:56.210,0:32:57.210
Wayne, laughing: The Fighting Game Minute—

0:32:57.210,0:32:58.730
Trog: —our weekly segment where we talk
about fighting

0:32:58.730,0:33:01.230
games, and it comes right after the Sonic
Minute.

0:33:01.230,0:33:02.900
Log: The Fighting Game Minute, it takes a
lot longer

0:33:02.900,0:33:03.900
than that.

0:33:03.900,0:33:05.330
Wayne: We should make that reoccurring and
make it an actual

0:33:05.330,0:33:08.519
minute where we have to talk about as much
fighting game content as

0:33:08.519,0:33:11.750
possible, and we can achieve this goal with
four people talking at once.

0:33:11.750,0:33:12.750
Log: Yeah.

0:33:12.750,0:33:13.750
Gir: I’m down for that.

0:33:13.750,0:33:15.549
Baaulp: We haven’t recorded in three months,
is there any,

0:33:15.549,0:33:16.549
like, life thing—

0:33:16.549,0:33:17.549
Wayne: So much—

0:33:17.549,0:33:18.549
Baaulp: —we wanna talk about first, or?

0:33:18.549,0:33:20.680
Wayne: I could tell a story about something
that happened at

0:33:20.680,0:33:21.680
work.

0:33:21.680,0:33:22.680
Trog: Go for it.

0:33:22.680,0:33:25.200
Wayne: So, sometimes customers are old ladies,
and need help

0:33:25.200,0:33:28.000
getting bags out to their car, and that’s
perfectly fine.

0:33:28.000,0:33:30.560
It’s like a forty-pound
bag of dog food, they’re not going to be

0:33:30.560,0:33:32.750
able to lift that over their heads,
out of the cart, and in to the car.

0:33:32.750,0:33:37.320
Uh, I get called up, and the lady that I
have to carry out for is like, a very-a very

0:33:37.320,0:33:41.590
old, feeble woman, she’s very
sweet, very nice, uh, she’s very thankful.

0:33:41.590,0:33:42.590
Trog: But very feeble.

0:33:42.590,0:33:43.700
Wayne: But very feeble.

0:33:43.700,0:33:45.380
I could flick her and she would
perish.

0:33:45.380,0:33:48.029
And we go outside and I’m like, I grab the
cart and I’m like, “Alright,

0:33:48.029,0:33:49.769
I’mma, uh, I’ll push the cart you lead
the way.”

0:33:49.769,0:33:51.130
And she’s like, “Okay.”

0:33:51.130,0:33:52.130
And
she does that.

0:33:52.130,0:33:54.980
She leads me to her car, she’s parked—Our
parking lot is on an

0:33:54.980,0:33:59.230
incline, and the incline goes further uh,
downwards away from our store.

0:33:59.230,0:34:01.440
So,
we’re like at the top of a very, very tiny

0:34:01.440,0:34:02.440
hill.

0:34:02.440,0:34:04.650
It’s not much of an incline,
but it’s enough that like, if something

0:34:04.650,0:34:07.360
was left to free roll, it would
go down that ramp.

0:34:07.360,0:34:09.940
Wayne: And uh, so, I’m pushing the cart,
and she’s in the

0:34:09.940,0:34:12.639
very first spot, the handicap spot at the
top of the parking lot.

0:34:12.639,0:34:16.609
I go to the
other side of her car, away from the-the building,

0:34:16.609,0:34:19.919
and uh, she says, “Hold on,
let me open up the backseat,” and she does,

0:34:19.919,0:34:22.830
and uh, and I’m like, “Alright,”
And I’m-I go to like pick up the bag and

0:34:22.830,0:34:24.940
I’m like, “Alright, ma’am you’re gonna
need to hold the cart, just so it doesn’t

0:34:24.940,0:34:25.940
roll away.

0:34:25.940,0:34:26.940
‘Cause without the bag in
it, it’s not gonna-it’s not gonna sit

0:34:26.940,0:34:27.940
still.”

0:34:27.940,0:34:29.100
Wayne: And she’s like, “Okay.”

0:34:29.100,0:34:32.060
So I pick up the bag, and I
see her going for it and then at-at which

0:34:32.060,0:34:36.089
point I take my eyes off that
scenario and I-I go—I go for the three seconds

0:34:36.089,0:34:38.889
it would take to put the bag in
the car and shut the door, and then I hear

0:34:38.889,0:34:40.669
her say from behind me, “Where did
it go?”

0:34:40.669,0:34:41.669
[Trog laughs]

0:34:41.669,0:34:42.669
Gir: Oh no.

0:34:42.669,0:34:44.639
Wayne: And I turn around and the cart is like,
fifteen feet

0:34:44.639,0:34:48.850
away from us, rolling away, and just as I
look it slams into the driver seat

0:34:48.850,0:34:50.580
door of an-of an SUV—

0:34:50.580,0:34:51.580
[Trog groans]

0:34:51.580,0:34:54.510
Wayne: With this like, nasty looking white
trash lady

0:34:54.510,0:34:58.410
smoking a cigarette with an open window, just
smokin’ the cigarette, “DOOK,”

0:34:58.410,0:35:02.950
hears the thud of the—hears the thud of
the carriage, and just gives us like,

0:35:02.950,0:35:06.470
the most—the-the biggest stink eye, and
doesn’t say anything and just keeps—and

0:35:06.470,0:35:09.020
just takes another drag off her cigarette
and is just staring at us, the old

0:35:09.020,0:35:11.780
lady’s just staring there, and I’m just
like, “Uh… bye.”

0:35:11.780,0:35:13.020
And I just left.

0:35:13.020,0:35:14.020
[Trog laughs and Gir sighs]

0:35:14.020,0:35:15.750
Wayne: And I-like, I don’t know what happened
after that, it

0:35:15.750,0:35:16.750
wasn’t my fault!

0:35:16.750,0:35:18.369
It was entirely the customer’s fault, and
we are not

0:35:18.369,0:35:21.670
responsible for cart damages in the parking
lot.

0:35:21.670,0:35:23.859
But it was very funny.

0:35:23.859,0:35:34.200
Trog: Blamin’ an old lady, I see how it
is.

0:35:34.200,0:35:35.830
[Baaulp laughs]

0:35:35.830,0:35:40.720
Wayne: It was very, very, funny.

0:35:40.720,0:35:44.010
Wayne: Alright, so time for questions?

0:35:44.010,0:35:46.300
Trog: It’s time for questions, I’d like
to start—

0:35:46.300,0:35:47.300
Wayne: Q’s and A’s.

0:35:47.300,0:35:49.900
Trog: —this round of Q and A with a disclaimer
that

0:35:49.900,0:35:54.329
it has been so long since we recorded any
episode of the podcast, I can’t

0:35:54.329,0:35:56.599
remember what questions we already answered.

0:35:56.599,0:36:01.210
So, if we retread our steps, I
apologize, but I’m not going back and listening

0:36:01.210,0:36:03.780
to the rest of the podcast to
figure out what we answered.

0:36:03.780,0:36:06.140
Wayne: I always listen to the podcast after
Baaulp is done

0:36:06.140,0:36:08.980
with them, so I’m-I’m pretty sure I’ll
remember if we’ve already done one.

0:36:08.980,0:36:09.980
Trog: Okay.

0:36:09.980,0:36:12.730
Here’s a question we definitely haven’t
answered before, and I’m very excited to

0:36:12.730,0:36:13.730
answer it.

0:36:13.730,0:36:17.950
Got a question from KingMusicManz
who asks, well, it’s more like a task, but,

0:36:17.950,0:36:23.610
they say, “Describe a method à la
Hitman of how you would assassinate another

0:36:23.610,0:36:24.610
member of the group.”

0:36:24.610,0:36:25.610
Gir: Hm.

0:36:25.610,0:36:26.610
Log: Uhh…

0:36:26.610,0:36:27.610
Wayne: Baaulp would be the easiest to kill.

0:36:27.610,0:36:28.610
Baaulp: What?

0:36:28.610,0:36:29.610
[Trog laughs]

0:36:29.610,0:36:30.610
Wayne: You would not-you would not taste-he
would not taste

0:36:30.610,0:36:31.610
poison in his food.

0:36:31.610,0:36:34.720
Log: Yeah, you could poison Baaulp at basically
any given

0:36:34.720,0:36:35.720
minute of the day.

0:36:35.720,0:36:38.250
Baaulp: I know what everything is supposed
to taste like,

0:36:38.250,0:36:39.250
fuck you.

0:36:39.250,0:36:40.250
Wayne: Actually, y’know, you do.

0:36:40.250,0:36:43.520
The dinner-the dinner is
such a high focus in your brain that maybe

0:36:43.520,0:36:45.290
you will recognize the slightest
change.

0:36:45.290,0:36:46.780
Gir: Baaulp is like when you need to medicate
a dog.

0:36:46.780,0:36:50.060
Log: You could also easily get into his room
from outside.

0:36:50.060,0:36:52.369
Wayne: Alright, I could kill Gir real easy.

0:36:52.369,0:36:53.369
Gir: No.

0:36:53.369,0:36:55.810
Wayne: When he goes fishing I hide under the
lake in a scuba

0:36:55.810,0:36:56.810
suit—

0:36:56.810,0:36:57.810
Trog: Alright—

0:36:57.810,0:36:58.810
Wayne: —grab his fishing line—

0:36:58.810,0:36:59.810
Trog: I think I have an idea to make this
a little more

0:36:59.810,0:37:02.200
organized, so I’m gonna-I’m gonna change
this question a little bit, I’m gonna

0:37:02.200,0:37:08.079
ask, “If you were the target in a Hitman
level, where would you want it to take

0:37:08.079,0:37:09.079
place?”

0:37:09.079,0:37:10.079
Wayne: That’s a completely different question!

0:37:10.079,0:37:11.079
Baaulp: That’s a different question—

0:37:11.079,0:37:12.180
Trog: No, no, no, but that’s the-that’s
the start.

0:37:12.180,0:37:13.630
So
everybody’s gonna say where they want to

0:37:13.630,0:37:17.070
take place, and then we can
answer—then somebody else can answer how

0:37:17.070,0:37:18.070
they would kill you.

0:37:18.070,0:37:19.930
Wayne: I feel like that’s overcomplicating
it.

0:37:19.930,0:37:22.310
Gir: I want to sit in a room with five people
staring at me

0:37:22.310,0:37:23.310
at all times.

0:37:23.310,0:37:24.310
[Baaulp laughs]

0:37:24.310,0:37:25.310
Trog: No, no.

0:37:25.310,0:37:26.310
You got to pick something that’s like a
place

0:37:26.310,0:37:27.310
where you would be, that you would like-like
to be.

0:37:27.310,0:37:28.750
Gir: My room with five people staring at me—

0:37:28.750,0:37:29.750
Trog: No—

0:37:29.750,0:37:30.750
Gir: —at all times.

0:37:30.750,0:37:31.750
[Baaulp laughs]

0:37:31.750,0:37:32.750
Trog: This is not the spirit of the question.

0:37:32.750,0:37:34.230
You’re gonna
make this poor viewer—listener cry.

0:37:34.230,0:37:36.650
Wayne: Well you added in this new term!

0:37:36.650,0:37:37.740
This is your
fault!

0:37:37.740,0:37:40.290
Trog: I’m trying to help facilitate discussion
here.

0:37:40.290,0:37:41.770
Wayne: It was already good!

0:37:41.770,0:37:42.770
It was great!

0:37:42.770,0:37:43.770
Let’s go back to
the old one.

0:37:43.770,0:37:45.640
Trog: It wasn’t good, everybody just said,
“I’m gonna poison

0:37:45.640,0:37:47.210
Baaulp,” and that was it!

0:37:47.210,0:37:48.300
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

0:37:48.300,0:37:49.880
Wayne: Log, how would you kill me?

0:37:49.880,0:37:51.599
Log: Uhh, let’s see.

0:37:51.599,0:37:53.530
I’d probably come up with an exploding
dog—

0:37:53.530,0:37:54.530
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:37:54.530,0:37:56.030
Gir: You’d come up with it.

0:37:56.030,0:37:57.790
Baaulp: He wouldn’t be able to resist.

0:37:57.790,0:38:02.460
Log: If I’m-if I’m Hitman they just have
the tech for me, I

0:38:02.460,0:38:03.460
don’t even have to come up with it.

0:38:03.460,0:38:05.300
I’d just have an exploding dog, and then
it

0:38:05.300,0:38:09.000
just goes up to you and… you don’t even
have to come to it.

0:38:09.000,0:38:11.440
It’s-I don’t-I
don’t even have to do the job.

0:38:11.440,0:38:12.440
It does it for me.

0:38:12.440,0:38:13.440
Wayne: I could tell.

0:38:13.440,0:38:15.300
I’ve seen a lot of dogs.

0:38:15.300,0:38:17.190
Log: Yeah, well, this is a new kind.

0:38:17.190,0:38:19.560
Wayne: It might be—I mean dogs are pretty
fast, I might not

0:38:19.560,0:38:21.820
be able to get away, but at that point why
don’t you just shoot me with a

0:38:21.820,0:38:23.820
Nikita missile from Metal Gear Solid.

0:38:23.820,0:38:24.820
[Trog laughs]

0:38:24.820,0:38:26.490
Log: Because I need to make it look like an
accident.

0:38:26.490,0:38:27.490
Trog, laughing: What?

0:38:27.490,0:38:29.540
How is an exploding dog an accident?

0:38:29.540,0:38:30.540
Wayne, laughing: Yeah!

0:38:30.540,0:38:35.829
Oh man this—oh no, Wayne accidentally
blew up during his training, aw.

0:38:35.829,0:38:38.210
Trog: This dog accidentally exploded!

0:38:38.210,0:38:40.630
Wayne: Shouldn’t have used that explosive
dog clicker!

0:38:40.630,0:38:44.170
Log: Aw dang, don’t you h—just hate it
whenever the dog just

0:38:44.170,0:38:47.680
has like, that collar that gives it a little
bit of a jump whenever it goes

0:38:47.680,0:38:49.460
past the invisible fence?

0:38:49.460,0:38:51.880
Who-Who’d’ve thought that if it goes five
hundred

0:38:51.880,0:38:54.550
miles past its invisible fence it just explodes!

0:38:54.550,0:38:56.740
Gir, laughing: You’ve gone too far.

0:38:56.740,0:38:59.990
Wayne, laughing: Alright, the dog’s gone
too far, the kill

0:38:59.990,0:39:01.150
protocol must be engaged.

0:39:01.150,0:39:03.200
Trog, laughing: We gotta-we gotta destroy
it.

0:39:03.200,0:39:04.200
[Wayne laughs harder]

0:39:04.200,0:39:07.810
Trog: I’m like imagining like, like a plastic
dog that’s

0:39:07.810,0:39:12.460
like, it can’t articulate in any way so
it’s just got like, chair wheels on the

0:39:12.460,0:39:15.291
bottom of his feet and is just like, slowly
rolling towards Wayne—

0:39:15.291,0:39:16.291
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

0:39:16.291,0:39:19.490
Trog: —playing like a barking clip out of
a speaker box

0:39:19.490,0:39:20.500
that’s built into its face.

0:39:20.500,0:39:23.820
Log: Tell you what, I’ll get the exploding
dog, it’ll be

0:39:23.820,0:39:28.020
plastic, I’ll leave it on the table just
in a place that you’ll be, and then

0:39:28.020,0:39:31.170
you’ll get a question mark over your head
and go to it, and that’s when I

0:39:31.170,0:39:32.170
detonate it.

0:39:32.170,0:39:34.050
Wayne: See, now I wanna imagine this scenario
but instead of

0:39:34.050,0:39:38.740
you doing it-it’s Agent 47, “Hello, I
need my dog trained, please.”

0:39:38.740,0:39:41.180
And
it’s just this like, plastic dog with wheels

0:39:41.180,0:39:42.180
on it.

0:39:42.180,0:39:43.180
[Wayne and Trog laugh]

0:39:43.180,0:39:44.180
Wayne: Aw man, they need to make more levels.

0:39:44.180,0:39:45.810
I mean, I
still have half a game to play through, but.

0:39:45.810,0:39:46.810
Fuck.

0:39:46.810,0:39:47.810
Trog: It’s true.

0:39:47.810,0:39:48.810
Wayne: Alright, so we gotta-I gotta hear-I
gotta hear

0:39:48.810,0:39:49.810
everyone’s answer.

0:39:49.810,0:39:50.819
How would-how would Baaulp kill me?

0:39:50.819,0:39:52.089
Baaulp: How would I kill you?

0:39:52.089,0:39:53.560
Trog: Are we all killing Wayne?

0:39:53.560,0:39:54.980
Or all we all killing
somebody else?

0:39:54.980,0:39:55.980
Gir: Yeah, what the fuck?

0:39:55.980,0:39:56.980
This ain’t no—

0:39:56.980,0:39:57.980
Wayne: Actually, yeah, here.

0:39:57.980,0:40:01.430
I’ve already done mine, and Log’s
done his, Baaulp you do one, Trog you do one.

0:40:01.430,0:40:04.319
Baaulp: How would you kill me beyond just
poisoning me,

0:40:04.319,0:40:05.960
which would work for anyone else?

0:40:05.960,0:40:07.319
Trog: I got a way.

0:40:07.319,0:40:13.510
So, I know that Baaulp takes public
transit, I would Agent 47 one of the drivers

0:40:13.510,0:40:18.490
of like, one of the subway cars,
and I would-I would drive the subway and I’d

0:40:18.490,0:40:20.730
press like, ‘detach car’ button
that he’s in—

0:40:20.730,0:40:22.089
Wayne, laughing: They total have—

0:40:22.089,0:40:25.200
Trog, laughing: —and then I would, I would
send him down

0:40:25.200,0:40:29.579
like, the wrong way into a brick wall and
he would cartoonishly run into it and

0:40:29.579,0:40:30.579
explode.

0:40:30.579,0:40:31.950
Gir: Along with all those civilian casualties.

0:40:31.950,0:40:34.700
Baaulp: Yeah, and I’m also in the subway
car alone

0:40:34.700,0:40:36.290
and no one else gets on.

0:40:36.290,0:40:38.579
Trog: I didn’t—Nobody said I had to get
a good score!

0:40:38.579,0:40:41.109
Wayne: You are not making use of all the buttons
that are

0:40:41.109,0:40:42.670
theoretically on the subway.

0:40:42.670,0:40:43.670
I would hit ‘turbo maximum’—

0:40:43.670,0:40:44.670
Gir: That’s not a button.

0:40:44.670,0:40:47.000
Wayne: —which is on every Boston subway
car.

0:40:47.000,0:40:48.760
Trog: But how are you going to get out of
it?

0:40:48.760,0:40:49.980
Wayne: Um, teleportation that I have—

0:40:49.980,0:40:50.980
Trog: No—

0:40:50.980,0:40:51.980
Gir: Nobody said he had to.

0:40:51.980,0:40:53.430
Trog: Agent 47 cannot teleport.

0:40:53.430,0:40:54.430
Wayne: Yes he can!

0:40:54.430,0:40:55.430
Trog: No he can’t!

0:40:55.430,0:40:56.430
Gir: You can’t turn on noclip.

0:40:56.430,0:40:57.430
Wayne, impersonating Agent 47: It’s time
to teleport.

0:40:57.430,0:40:58.430
[Trog laughs]

0:40:58.430,0:40:59.430
[Wayne makes a teleporting sound]

0:40:59.430,0:41:00.430
Gir, also impersonating Agent 47: Right.

0:41:00.430,0:41:01.430
Teleport,
Hitman.

0:41:01.430,0:41:02.430
Log: You’re really overcomplicating this.

0:41:02.430,0:41:03.819
I would just hit
the subway’s ‘jump’ button.

0:41:03.819,0:41:04.819
[Wayne laughs]

0:41:04.819,0:41:07.020
Log, laughing: And it would hit the-it would
hit the ceiling

0:41:07.020,0:41:08.820
and Baaulp would get crushed!

0:41:08.820,0:41:11.520
Wayne: Alright, welcome, welcome to the Boston
subway

0:41:11.520,0:41:12.880
training session.

0:41:12.880,0:41:14.130
Uh, first rule.

0:41:14.130,0:41:15.130
There’s a jump button.

0:41:15.130,0:41:16.130
DON’T PRESS IT.

0:41:16.130,0:41:17.130
[Trog laughs]

0:41:17.130,0:41:18.130
Wayne, laughing: YOU WILL KILL EVERYONE.

0:41:18.130,0:41:19.130
[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

0:41:19.130,0:41:20.400
Gir: What, this one?

0:41:20.400,0:41:22.090
[Gir makes an explosion sound]

0:41:22.090,0:41:23.750
Log: We here at Dahir Insaat think that implementing—

Log: —this jump button onto the Boston subway
system will

0:41:27.120,0:41:29.490
let you have two subways going in tandem!

0:41:29.490,0:41:30.630
Trog: Oh god.

0:41:30.630,0:41:32.890
Log: Simply have one jump over the other.

0:41:32.890,0:41:35.619
Wayne: Supreme Dahir Insaat training facilities
will make

0:41:35.619,0:41:38.800
sure that drivers will always use button in
correct fashion.

0:41:38.800,0:41:40.079
Gir: Multitrack jumping.

0:41:40.079,0:41:42.110
Wayne: Baaulp, I would just wait until you’re
doing one of

0:41:42.110,0:41:45.060
your Let’s Plays inside a box, walk into
your room with a sledgehammer, and

0:41:45.060,0:41:46.060
just…

0:41:46.060,0:41:47.060
get you.

0:41:47.060,0:41:48.060
You wouldn’t see it coming.

0:41:48.060,0:41:49.060
Trog: How are you gonna get past his mom,
though?

0:41:49.060,0:41:50.060
Wayne: Oh fuck.

0:41:50.060,0:41:52.350
Actually, yeah, Baaulp’s mom would never
let me walk in his house with a sledgehammer.

0:41:52.350,0:41:53.350
[Trog laughs]

0:41:53.350,0:41:55.770
Wayne: And Baaulp’s mom is like, awake all
night, too.

0:41:55.770,0:41:58.040
Like,
we-we could talk to Baaulp so late in the

0:41:58.040,0:41:59.369
night and his mom will still be
up.

0:41:59.369,0:42:02.660
Gir: Y’know, I could very easily kill everyone
except Baaulp,

0:42:02.660,0:42:06.109
because all I would have to do is have a gun
and say, “Hey look!

0:42:06.109,0:42:07.349
Look how much
food Baaulp is eating!”

0:42:07.349,0:42:09.080
And you’ll turn around to look and I’ll
just shoot you.

0:42:09.080,0:42:10.080
It’s that simple.

0:42:10.080,0:42:11.080
Trog: I’m not that dumb.

0:42:11.080,0:42:12.470
Log: So you’d have to bring Baaulp, too.

0:42:12.470,0:42:14.490
Trog: I won’t fall for it now that you’ve
told me.

0:42:14.490,0:42:16.350
Gir: “Hey, look how much food Trevor’s
eating!”

0:42:16.350,0:42:17.350
And then I
shoot you.

0:42:17.350,0:42:19.780
Log: You’re indoctrinating Baaulp as your
Agent 48, here.

0:42:19.780,0:42:21.790
Wayne: You can just change it, turn on Baaulp’s
TV and just say,

0:42:21.790,0:42:23.829
“Oh my god, 13th century cooking!”

0:42:23.829,0:42:24.829
And then—

0:42:24.829,0:42:26.300
Gir: Oh no, I would say, “Hey—Oh my god,
Baaulp, look how

0:42:26.300,0:42:27.300
much food’s not being eaten!”

0:42:27.300,0:42:29.900
Trog: I would just roll an explosive television
into his

0:42:29.900,0:42:33.810
room that’s constantly playing tiny food
videos and How It’s Made clips.

0:42:33.810,0:42:35.110
[Gir and Log laugh]

0:42:35.110,0:42:37.930
Wayne, laughing: Yeah, you-you also add a
uh, a head sized

0:42:37.930,0:42:40.380
compartment at the bottom of the TV and it
says, “Put your head in here, extra

0:42:40.380,0:42:41.380
quality!”

0:42:41.380,0:42:42.380
And it’s a guillotine.

0:42:42.380,0:42:43.380
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:42:43.380,0:42:45.580
Trog: And then just throw coins all around
his room.

0:42:45.580,0:42:46.580
[Gir laughs]

0:42:46.580,0:42:47.580
Wayne, laughing: To distract him

0:42:47.580,0:42:48.580
Trog, laughing: To distract him.

0:42:48.580,0:42:49.700
Wayne: Baaulp, Baaulp, Baaulp.

0:42:49.700,0:42:51.600
Okay, you are in your room
right now.

0:42:51.600,0:42:54.151
If you heard a coin hit the floor and land
behind you, would you

0:42:54.151,0:42:55.180
stand up and go get it?

0:42:55.180,0:42:56.630
Baaulp: I’m pretty slow, probably not.

0:42:56.630,0:42:57.630
[Log and Wayne laugh]

0:42:57.630,0:42:59.510
Log, still laughing: What, is your mom gonna
get it first?

0:42:59.510,0:43:00.980
Wayne, still laughing: Like-like you wouldn’t
be able to

0:43:00.980,0:43:01.980
reach it?

0:43:01.980,0:43:02.980
Baaulp: Eh…

0:43:02.980,0:43:03.980
Gir: His pathing is bad.

0:43:03.980,0:43:04.980
Wayne: What kind of slow?

0:43:04.980,0:43:06.390
Like you’re not fast enough
to get it?

0:43:06.390,0:43:08.829
Baaulp: When things fall around me, I don’t
really react.

0:43:08.829,0:43:10.410
[Log and Wayne laugh]

0:43:10.410,0:43:14.200
Baaulp: I’ve had like, chairs fall… next
to my head… and

0:43:14.200,0:43:15.200
stuff….

0:43:15.200,0:43:16.200
Trog: What?

0:43:16.200,0:43:17.200
How?

0:43:17.200,0:43:18.200
What?

0:43:18.200,0:43:19.200
[Log and Wayne laugh]

0:43:19.200,0:43:20.200
Wayne, laughing hard: How did a chair fall
next to your

0:43:20.200,0:43:21.200
head?

0:43:21.200,0:43:22.200
Were you lying down?

0:43:22.200,0:43:23.200
Baaulp: …A little.

0:43:23.200,0:43:24.200
[A moment of silence]

0:43:24.200,0:43:25.200
[Everyone bursts into laughter]

0:43:25.200,0:43:26.200
Gir, laughing: A little?

0:43:26.200,0:43:27.200
You can’t just lie down a
little!

0:43:27.200,0:43:28.200
Log: I think that’s-I think that’s called
sitting.

0:43:28.200,0:43:29.400
Baaulp: One time I was at the bus stop, and
the bus was

0:43:29.400,0:43:32.480
rolling up, but for some reason they were
going really fast and then

0:43:32.480,0:43:35.980
they like, slammed on the brakes kinda hard,
and as I was getting on the bus

0:43:35.980,0:43:37.059
the guy was like, “Hey!

0:43:37.059,0:43:38.609
Next time don’t stand so close!

0:43:38.609,0:43:40.930
The mirror almost hit
your head!”

0:43:40.930,0:43:42.630
And I didn’t even notice.

0:43:42.630,0:43:43.630
[Wayne laughs]

0:43:43.630,0:43:46.410
Trog: ItsAGundamu asks, “If you could put
any character in Smash

0:43:46.410,0:43:47.859
Bros. Ultimate, who would it be?”

0:43:47.859,0:43:48.859
Gir: Ah, Goku.

0:43:48.859,0:43:52.150
Trog: I picked this one out because I got
an answer that is—and

0:43:52.150,0:43:55.730
we were talking about it, and I think this
is entirely possible.

0:43:55.730,0:43:57.670
And it is Sora
from Kingdom Hearts.

0:43:57.670,0:43:58.670
Baaulp: Sure.

0:43:58.670,0:43:59.670
Wayne: I would love Alucard.

0:43:59.670,0:44:00.670
Trog: Alucard would be pretty sick.

0:44:00.670,0:44:01.990
Gir: Alucard’s not gonna happen.

0:44:01.990,0:44:04.050
Wayne: I don’t even play Castlevania and
I would love

0:44:04.050,0:44:05.050
Alucard.

0:44:05.050,0:44:06.050
Baaulp: I want…

0:44:06.050,0:44:07.050
Goku.

0:44:07.050,0:44:08.050
Gir: Yes, there’s two for Goku.

0:44:08.050,0:44:10.240
Baaulp: ‘Cause everyone wants it, but like,
it’s possible.

0:44:10.240,0:44:11.380
It’s actually possible.

0:44:11.380,0:44:14.310
If they-if they’re willing to go as far
as to put a

0:44:14.310,0:44:18.530
Persona character into the game—like Dragon
Ball FighterZ is on the Switch, like

0:44:18.530,0:44:20.630
that’s even a closer connection.

0:44:20.630,0:44:23.349
Wayne: Someone I follow on Tumblr pitched
such an amazing

0:44:23.349,0:44:25.850
idea for a character to be added, and I can’t
remember what it was.

0:44:25.850,0:44:27.520
Gir: Oh, It was choir kids.

0:44:27.520,0:44:28.520
Trog, laughing: Yeah.

0:44:28.520,0:44:30.940
Wayne: I mean that’d be pretty cool, I don’t
know how they’d

0:44:30.940,0:44:31.940
do that, but—

0:44:31.940,0:44:32.940
Gir: No, it wouldn’t.

0:44:32.940,0:44:33.940
It would be so fucking dumb.

0:44:33.940,0:44:36.880
Trog: Um, I’m gonna say Sora or Killer Mike.

0:44:36.880,0:44:37.990
[Log and Wayne laugh]

0:44:37.990,0:44:39.530
Gir: Either one’s just as likely.

0:44:39.530,0:44:40.530
Trog: Yeah.

0:44:40.530,0:44:42.270
Log: Killer Mike and El-P will just be a echo
fighters for

0:44:42.270,0:44:43.270
Ice Climbers.

0:44:43.270,0:44:44.270
[Gir and Trog laugh]

0:44:44.270,0:44:45.270
Wayne: Oh, that’d be so good.

0:44:45.270,0:44:48.670
Log: Y’know, hold on, rewind the tapes because
I wanna take

0:44:48.670,0:44:52.450
the ech-the word echo fighter out of my mouth
and like, lay it down on the

0:44:52.450,0:44:53.580
counter and hit it with a knife.

0:44:53.580,0:44:54.580
Trog: See, they, they—

0:44:54.580,0:44:55.580
[Wayne laughs]

0:44:55.580,0:44:56.580
Gir: What?

0:44:56.580,0:44:57.580
Trog: --tricked you into calling them echo
fighters, now.

0:44:57.580,0:44:58.580
They got everybody.

0:44:58.580,0:45:00.329
Log: I was trying to use the game’s vernacular
but

0:45:00.329,0:45:02.340
really—echo fighter’s a dumb shit phrase.

0:45:02.340,0:45:03.340
It’s a clone.

0:45:03.340,0:45:04.340
Trog: It is.

0:45:04.340,0:45:06.589
Log: Every fighting game has called it clones
since the

0:45:06.589,0:45:07.829
beginning of time.

0:45:07.829,0:45:10.630
Why’s Smash Brothers gotta come up with
new funny words for

0:45:10.630,0:45:11.630
everything.

0:45:11.630,0:45:12.880
It’s like, “echo fighters,” and “jivvies,”—

0:45:12.880,0:45:13.920
Baaulp: Mama mia—

0:45:13.920,0:45:16.559
Log: —and “jimmies,” and “stevens,”
and “guessies,” and

0:45:16.559,0:45:17.559
“friendlies,” and—

0:45:17.559,0:45:18.569
Gir: Who cares?

0:45:18.569,0:45:19.569
Log: —“funny,”—

0:45:19.569,0:45:20.579
Wayne: And “whim-whams”—

0:45:20.579,0:45:22.089
Log: “Funny farms,” and “sillies.”

0:45:22.089,0:45:23.089
Baaulp: “Flim-flam.”

0:45:23.089,0:45:24.089
Trog: This isn’t funny but—

0:45:24.089,0:45:25.140
Wayne: Then why are y—Why-why bother.

0:45:25.140,0:45:26.140
Gir: Ehm, stop talking already!

0:45:26.140,0:45:27.140
Wayne: Fuck!

0:45:27.140,0:45:29.730
Trog: The explanation that I heard for calling
them echo

0:45:29.730,0:45:35.720
fighters and not clones is that like, clones
are like, a story thing in this

0:45:35.720,0:45:36.720
one?

0:45:36.720,0:45:37.720
Like, you’re fighting clones, like—

0:45:37.720,0:45:38.720
Gir: Oh, yeahhh.

0:45:38.720,0:45:40.060
Trog: —you’re fighting clones of things.

0:45:40.060,0:45:43.040
I’m not saying that
is a good reason for why they called it that—

0:45:43.040,0:45:44.040
Gir: It’s a fair reason.

0:45:44.040,0:45:46.661
Trog: I believe that was their reasoning,
was that they

0:45:46.661,0:45:49.160
didn’t want to confuse people.

0:45:49.160,0:45:50.160
I guess.

0:45:50.160,0:45:51.160
Gir: I think that’s fair.

0:45:51.160,0:45:52.160
Log: Alright, well—

0:45:52.160,0:45:53.780
Trog: Again, not-not saying it’s a good
reason, I’m

0:45:53.780,0:45:55.240
just saying that is the reason.

0:45:55.240,0:45:57.809
Log: I don’t know how much I-I wanna take
it.

0:45:57.809,0:46:00.690
I don’t th-I
don’t know how much I want to accept that.

0:46:00.690,0:46:01.720
We’ll leave it like that.

0:46:01.720,0:46:03.520
Wayne: I would love to see Banjo-Kazooie.

0:46:03.520,0:46:05.280
Trog: Yeah, of course.

0:46:05.280,0:46:06.280
That’s… y’know.

0:46:06.280,0:46:07.740
Wayne: And that one’s not even impossible.

0:46:07.740,0:46:10.640
Trog: Everybody-every—I want to see Banjo-Kazooie
in anything,

0:46:10.640,0:46:11.640
so badly.

0:46:11.640,0:46:12.720
Wayne, laughing: Yeah.

That one could happen, I think.

0:46:22.109,0:46:23.160
That’s one, I think that one will happen.

release date, right?

does swears and

for children to see, like uh—

jerking off

0:47:03.109,0:47:04.109
charge-up?

0:47:04.109,0:47:05.109

0:47:05.109,0:47:06.109
Wayne: That’s so iconic.

0:47:06.109,0:47:08.760
Log: I think they could obscure it and it
would be safe.

0:47:08.760,0:47:10.780
Wayne: I-no, I think it looks worse if they
obscure

0:47:10.780,0:47:11.780
it, if—

0:47:11.780,0:47:12.990
Trog: Yeah, then it-then it looks like he’s
actually doing

0:47:12.990,0:47:13.990
it—

0:47:13.990,0:47:14.990
Wayne, laughing: If you see that from his
back and you can’t

0:47:14.990,0:47:15.990
see the saber anymore—

0:47:15.990,0:47:16.990
Trog: Yeah.

0:47:16.990,0:47:18.609
Wayne, impersonating the Smash Announcer:
Travis Touchdown

0:47:18.609,0:47:20.270
used his neutral B to jack off!

0:47:20.270,0:47:21.270
[Log laughs]

0:47:21.270,0:47:22.700
Log: They could do anything with that, it’ll
work.

0:47:22.700,0:47:23.700
Gir: Travis Touchdick.

0:47:23.700,0:47:26.650
Log: He just has to shake the sword anywhere
so, they could

0:47:26.650,0:47:27.650
do it.

0:47:27.650,0:47:29.030
Wayne: When he does his side B he says, “Fuck
head.”

0:47:29.030,0:47:30.030
Log: Yeah—

0:47:30.030,0:47:31.030
[Gir snorts]

0:47:31.030,0:47:32.710
Log: That’s a requirement, though so, Smash
Brothers is

0:47:32.710,0:47:34.829
about to not be for kids, I’m sorry to say.

0:47:34.829,0:47:35.829
Wayne: Now it’s for me.

0:47:35.829,0:47:36.829
Log: Yeah.

0:47:36.829,0:47:38.670
Gir: Well it’s got guns and grenades in
it, so.

0:47:38.670,0:47:41.319
Log: Isn’t it weird that they let Bayonetta
have guns but

0:47:41.319,0:47:42.550
never gave Snake his gun?

0:47:42.550,0:47:43.550
Wayne: Yeah, what the fuck.

0:47:43.550,0:47:45.870
Trog: Isn’t it weird how Mario’s in the
game?

0:47:45.870,0:47:47.480
Wayne: I mean Bayonetta’s are magic guns.

0:47:47.480,0:47:49.050
Gir: He’s about that CQC.

0:47:49.050,0:47:50.750
Wayne: Bayonetta’s are magic guns, which
you could say like,

0:47:50.750,0:47:52.800
“Oh, it’s magic guns, it wouldn’t kill
you like a real gun.”

0:47:52.800,0:47:54.550
But the whole
point of Bayonetta’s guns is that they are

0:47:54.550,0:47:56.730
much more effective than a
real gun.

0:47:56.730,0:47:58.569
Trog: They kill demons and angels.

0:47:58.569,0:47:59.569
Wayne: Yeah.

0:47:59.569,0:48:00.569
Trog: Crazy.

0:48:00.569,0:48:05.500
Moving on, we got a question from DoctorElsewhere,
who asks, “What’s your dream house?”

0:48:05.500,0:48:07.170
Wayne: Upside down, I can’t jump.

0:48:07.170,0:48:09.400
Gir: Oh man, I’m not allowed to answer this
one.

0:48:09.400,0:48:10.890
Trog: You’re not allowed to answer that?

0:48:10.890,0:48:13.270
Baaulp: Gir has to answer first now, now that
he’s said

0:48:13.270,0:48:14.270
that.

0:48:14.270,0:48:16.290
Trog: What-what’s up with your fucked up
house that you

0:48:16.290,0:48:17.710
can’t answer this question?

0:48:17.710,0:48:21.070
Gir:  You guys’re just
gonna call me a fuckin’… simple man.

0:48:21.070,0:48:22.750
Baaulp: I just-I just wanna know.

0:48:22.750,0:48:23.750
You made it tantalizing.

0:48:23.750,0:48:27.800
Gir: I wanna house, middle of nowhere, in
the woods by a lake,

0:48:27.800,0:48:28.800
and that’s it.

0:48:28.800,0:48:31.369
Baaulp: Why do you feel like we would laugh
at you for that?

0:48:31.369,0:48:32.680
You can fish, that’s what you like.

0:48:32.680,0:48:35.010
Gir: That’s exactly it, is I just want a
house with no

0:48:35.010,0:48:38.000
neighbors, I’m by myself, out in the woods,
fishin’ every day.

0:48:38.000,0:48:40.780
Wayne: I want my house to be big, I think
it needs a nice,

0:48:40.780,0:48:44.310
clean, sheen coat of blue paint, and it needs
a bear.

0:48:44.310,0:48:45.740
Baaulp, laughing: A bear?

0:48:45.740,0:48:46.740
Oh fuck.

0:48:46.740,0:48:47.740
Wayne: Yeah.

0:48:47.740,0:48:48.740
Gir: At the door, guarding.

0:48:48.740,0:48:49.740
Baaulp: Who would you live with?

0:48:49.740,0:48:50.740
Wayne and Gir: The bear.

0:48:50.740,0:48:51.740
[Gir and Trog laugh]

0:48:51.740,0:48:53.400
Wayne: The bear’s friendly, he sings!

0:48:53.400,0:48:54.900
Trog: And the moon sings to you.

0:48:54.900,0:48:57.020
Wayne: Also the moon-the moon has a face,
here.

0:48:57.020,0:48:58.790
Gir: You can see a face on the moon from my
house!

0:48:58.790,0:49:01.900
Baaulp: There were a lot of characters you
didn’t name any like,

0:49:01.900,0:49:02.900
of them, except for the bear.

0:49:02.900,0:49:03.960
Wayne: The little mouse.

0:49:03.960,0:49:04.960
Little mouse.

0:49:04.960,0:49:05.960
I don’t know I don’t
remember that much—

0:49:05.960,0:49:06.960
Baaulp, laughing: Little mouse.

0:49:06.960,0:49:07.960
Yeah.

0:49:07.960,0:49:09.400
Trog: Sure hope you were born between the
years of like,

0:49:09.400,0:49:11.790
1993 and 1997 to get these references.

0:49:11.790,0:49:14.180
Wayne: People know what the Bear in the Big
Blue House is!

0:49:14.180,0:49:15.180
Trog: Do they?

0:49:15.180,0:49:16.180
Baaulp: Yeah, I think they do.

0:49:16.180,0:49:17.180
Trog: Do they?

0:49:17.180,0:49:18.180
Baaulp: Enough people do.

0:49:18.180,0:49:19.180
Gir: Oh, that’s what you were talking about.

0:49:19.180,0:49:20.180
Trog: See?

0:49:20.180,0:49:21.180
Gir didn’t even know what you were talkin’
about.

0:49:21.180,0:49:23.810
Baaulp: Gir, I gotta question for you and
your dream home.

0:49:23.810,0:49:27.230
Who’s gonna, if it’s a lake, who’s gonna
repopulate with fish?

0:49:27.230,0:49:29.190
You’re gonna go
ham on that every day.

0:49:29.190,0:49:32.210
Gir: It’s not like, a lake in the middle
of—I don’t mean literally

0:49:32.210,0:49:34.390
the middle of fucking nowhere, I mean low-low
population.

0:49:34.390,0:49:37.010
Trog: Now here’s the thing, though, if you’re
living in the

0:49:37.010,0:49:39.670
middle of nowhere, the Internet is gonna suck.

0:49:39.670,0:49:40.720
Gir: Yeah, I can live with that.

0:49:40.720,0:49:41.940
Trog: How are you gonna play Fortnite?

0:49:41.940,0:49:44.069
Wayne: There—I can’t remember what country
it is in Europe,

0:49:44.069,0:49:47.190
but there’s like a European country, I remember
reading like, the-the woman who

0:49:47.190,0:49:49.839
has the fastest Internet in the world lives
in the middle of nowhere.

0:49:49.839,0:49:50.839
Gir: That’s Sweden.

0:49:50.839,0:49:51.839
Wayne: Yes.

0:49:51.839,0:49:53.990
Gir: That’s some sw-old Swedish lady has
the world’s fastest

0:49:53.990,0:49:54.990
Internet.

0:49:54.990,0:49:55.990
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:49:55.990,0:49:58.619
Trog: My dreamhouse would be… an efficient
house, in that I

0:49:58.619,0:50:00.220
don’t need like, a mansion.

0:50:00.220,0:50:02.960
I actually would rather have my house probably
only

0:50:02.960,0:50:08.059
have like, four rooms in it max, and like
maybe a couple living areas.

0:50:08.059,0:50:11.440
I would
like a space to put a bunch of instruments,

0:50:11.440,0:50:13.150
‘cause that’d be fun.

0:50:13.150,0:50:14.150
Wayne: I just want a studio.

0:50:14.150,0:50:15.150
Trog: Yeah.

0:50:15.150,0:50:18.790
Well see, I think a studio would be better
suited to-to not in your house, right?

0:50:18.790,0:50:21.330
Baaulp: That’s where you would go not in
your home.

0:50:21.330,0:50:22.670
Where would you come home to?

0:50:22.670,0:50:26.109
Wayne: I’m going to repurpose my-my wish
points that you’re

0:50:26.109,0:50:28.280
giving me with this question and put them
towards a studio.

0:50:28.280,0:50:29.540
Baaulp, laughing: Yeah, okay.

0:50:29.540,0:50:33.380
Trog: So instead of having a house that has
a studio in it,

0:50:33.380,0:50:36.720
you’re wishing for a studio that you just
can happen to live in.

0:50:36.720,0:50:37.720
Wayne: Uhhh…

0:50:37.720,0:50:39.000
I don’t know about that.

0:50:39.000,0:50:40.860
Gir: What you need is a nice big basement.

0:50:40.860,0:50:42.410
Wayne: But you need more than that for a studio.

0:50:42.410,0:50:43.410
Gir: No.

0:50:43.410,0:50:44.410
Trog: Yeah, like lights and a camera.

0:50:44.410,0:50:45.569
Wayne: It needs to be more than one room.

0:50:45.569,0:50:48.590
Gir: Uh, My family once house sat for someone
who had a

0:50:48.590,0:50:54.220
fuckin’ like million, two million dollar
home, and their basement was like, as

0:50:54.220,0:50:56.040
tall as my ceiling is.

0:50:56.040,0:50:57.040
It was like.

0:50:57.040,0:51:00.920
A few hundred square feet, or a few
thousand square feet in that basement.

0:51:00.920,0:51:03.190
Trog: On the topic of basements, to me, as
somebody who

0:51:03.190,0:51:07.119
lives in the south, where like, you literally
can’t build basements here

0:51:07.119,0:51:08.380
because the ground is too hard—

0:51:08.380,0:51:09.380
Gir: Same.

0:51:09.380,0:51:12.110
Trog: —Basements were such like a mystical
thing for me as a

0:51:12.110,0:51:16.460
kid that I was like, “God, I just want a
basement so bad, it just seems cool

0:51:16.460,0:51:18.760
to have a-a house beneath your house.”

0:51:18.760,0:51:19.760
Gir: Yeah, same.

0:51:19.760,0:51:20.890
Wayne: The basement is a special place.

0:51:20.890,0:51:23.070
Gir: You get old enough to be like, “Oh,
that’s the part of

0:51:23.070,0:51:24.670
the house where all the bugs live.”

0:51:24.670,0:51:25.670
Trog: And it’s smelly.

0:51:25.670,0:51:26.670
Wayne: That’s where I don’t go.

0:51:26.670,0:51:27.950
Baaulp: There might be radon in there.

0:51:27.950,0:51:31.000
Wayne: In the house I grew up in, we had a
uh, unfinished

0:51:31.000,0:51:34.730
basement, and then we finished it, and it
became like—It had two rooms, there

0:51:34.730,0:51:38.920
was the personal gym, and then to the side
was the TV room, and that was like,

0:51:38.920,0:51:40.819
where we had our 80 inch TV.

0:51:40.819,0:51:43.180
It would become belovedly known as the Space
TV in

0:51:43.180,0:51:44.180
this friend group.

0:51:44.180,0:51:45.180
Gir: The Big 'Creen.

0:51:45.180,0:51:47.470
Wayne: And I had-I had a lot of good memories
playing PS3

0:51:47.470,0:51:48.470
games down there.

0:51:48.470,0:51:49.470
It was a special place.

0:51:49.470,0:51:50.470
Gir: Nice.

0:51:50.470,0:51:51.470
Wayne: Not all basements are dingy.

0:51:51.470,0:51:52.470
Sometimes they’re nice.

0:51:52.470,0:51:54.040
Trog: One thing that I’m weird about when
it comes to

0:51:54.040,0:51:57.460
houses, ‘cause I’m actually uh, looking
to buy a house here in maybe like, a

0:51:57.460,0:52:02.260
couple years or so, is that I really don’t
want a two story house, but for some

0:52:02.260,0:52:06.030
reason I would be okay with a house with a
basement, which is essentially two

0:52:06.030,0:52:08.460
stories but it’s just like, everything is
moved down one.

0:52:08.460,0:52:09.460
Baaulp: Yeah, what?

0:52:09.460,0:52:10.930
Wayne: I mean, is it a visual reason?

0:52:10.930,0:52:13.640
Do you not like
the-like, the visual aspect of a two-story

0:52:13.640,0:52:14.640
house?

0:52:14.640,0:52:15.640
Trog: I don’t like the idea of stairs.

0:52:15.640,0:52:19.220
I don’t like the idea
of me like, having to go up and down stairs

0:52:19.220,0:52:20.220
to do things.

0:52:20.220,0:52:21.790
Baaulp: But you would need stairs for a basement.

0:52:21.790,0:52:23.820
Wayne: I feel that in most houses with a basement,
the

0:52:23.820,0:52:27.069
basement is a room that you don’t have to
go to on every day

0:52:27.069,0:52:28.069
Baaulp: Right.

0:52:28.069,0:52:29.869
Wayne: If you have two stories, your bedroom
is probably up

0:52:29.869,0:52:30.869
there.

0:52:30.869,0:52:31.869
Trog: Right.

0:52:31.869,0:52:34.650
Baaulp: Trog’s dream home is a one-story
home with a

0:52:34.650,0:52:36.810
basement that you descend via rope ladder.

0:52:36.810,0:52:38.190
Wayne, laughing: Yeah, make it harder.

0:52:38.190,0:52:39.270
Trog, laughing: Yeah, exactly.

0:52:39.270,0:52:40.270
I don’t want stairs.

0:52:40.270,0:52:42.330
Gir: No, he’s got an elevator in his own
home.

0:52:42.330,0:52:43.330
Trog: Or an escalator.

0:52:43.330,0:52:45.460
Baaulp: You have to get in a bucket and lower
yourself down.

0:52:45.460,0:52:46.460
Trog: Yeah, exactly.

0:52:46.460,0:52:48.470
Wayne: This is gonna like, like double up
on this question

0:52:48.470,0:52:51.359
but—so I don’t really have a big answer
for this right now because honestly

0:52:51.359,0:52:53.680
right now I’m not picky, I’d love-I’d
just love a house.

0:52:53.680,0:52:54.680
Honestly.

0:52:54.680,0:52:56.160
Baaulp: But what is your dream home?

0:52:56.160,0:52:59.510
Wayne: Even so, I know, that’s just like-that’s
just how I am.

0:52:59.510,0:53:00.510
I don’t like—

0:53:00.510,0:53:01.510
Baaulp: You can’t think of anything?

0:53:01.510,0:53:02.510
Wayne: I don’t think too…

0:53:02.510,0:53:03.510
large in terms of those sorts of
things.

0:53:03.510,0:53:05.210
Log: I wanna live on a spaceship.

0:53:05.210,0:53:06.210
Gir: Ah, shit.

0:53:06.210,0:53:07.640
I change my mind I’m with Log.

0:53:07.640,0:53:09.720
Wayne: I feel like if I had a lotta money
and could get a

0:53:09.720,0:53:12.869
house, in this case I’d just get a house
and I’d sit on that money.

0:53:12.869,0:53:15.130
And the
money would be spent on stupid shit, like

0:53:15.130,0:53:16.990
putting an image I thought was funny
on a billboard.

0:53:16.990,0:53:18.109
[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

0:53:18.109,0:53:20.580
Wayne: What I was gonna change this question
into was, when

0:53:20.580,0:53:24.730
you were a kid, did you have any like, house
features that you thought like,

0:53:24.730,0:53:26.130
“Oh man, that would be in my dream house.”

0:53:26.130,0:53:27.770
because like, I don’t have
that anymore, but—

0:53:27.770,0:53:28.770
Gir: Yeah.

0:53:28.770,0:53:30.500
Wayne: When I was a kid, I thought a spiral
staircase was

0:53:30.500,0:53:31.890
the ultimate sign of decadence.

0:53:31.890,0:53:33.900
Trog: Spiral staircases are pretty sick.

0:53:33.900,0:53:34.900
Wayne: They seem dangerous.

0:53:34.900,0:53:36.119
Gir: You know what I would—I’ve always
wanted?

0:53:36.119,0:53:38.559
I’ve always
wanted a secret room.

0:53:38.559,0:53:40.880
Like you have to go into your closet and you
have to open

0:53:40.880,0:53:41.880
a little hatch.

0:53:41.880,0:53:44.430
Trog: Yeah, no I was literally-that was gonna
be my answer.

0:53:44.430,0:53:45.800
I still want one.

0:53:45.800,0:53:46.800
This is no joke.

0:53:46.800,0:53:49.869
Whenever you’re a kid and your
parents are watching the TV, you don’t get

0:53:49.869,0:53:50.890
to choose what’s on the TV.

0:53:50.890,0:53:54.390
I would
watch television with my mother who would,

0:53:54.390,0:53:59.599
as most white women do, watch HGTV,
the Home and Garden Network.

0:53:59.599,0:54:02.910
They literally had a show devoted to, “Here
are

0:54:02.910,0:54:05.380
houses with six secret rooms in them.”

0:54:05.380,0:54:10.230
And ever since I saw that as a kid, it
has been in my head that like, I want a secret

0:54:10.230,0:54:11.450
room in my house.

0:54:11.450,0:54:14.589
I want some
kind of crazy contraption, I wanna have to

0:54:14.589,0:54:19.460
pull the book out of the bookshelf,
I wanna like, Scooby-Do where—like, rotating

0:54:19.460,0:54:20.460
wall.

0:54:20.460,0:54:21.589
Wayne: What would you put in it?

0:54:21.589,0:54:23.210
Baaulp: Yeah, what would you-what would your
room be for?

0:54:23.210,0:54:25.369
Trog: It doesn’t matter, like that’s the
thing.

0:54:25.369,0:54:27.750
It doesn’t
matter what’s in it, it just matters that

0:54:27.750,0:54:28.750
it is a secret.

0:54:28.750,0:54:30.099
Baaulp: Just fill it with watermelons.

0:54:30.099,0:54:32.690
Wayne: Just put your Street Fighter cartoon
animation cel in

0:54:32.690,0:54:33.700
there and nothing else.

0:54:33.700,0:54:34.700
[Baaulp laughs]

0:54:34.700,0:54:35.700
Wayne: That’d be so good!

0:54:35.700,0:54:36.700
Trog: Exactly.

0:54:36.700,0:54:37.960
Like, you just open it and it’s just that.

0:54:37.960,0:54:39.300
Wayne: Like you invite somebody to your house,
“Hey man, I’m

0:54:39.300,0:54:41.510
gonna show you something that no one’s ever
seen before.”

0:54:41.510,0:54:43.760
Trog: This is my fucking secret room.

0:54:43.760,0:54:44.760
Get ready.

0:54:44.760,0:54:46.630
Wayne: And you-you play-you play the piano
password, the

0:54:46.630,0:54:50.510
door opens and it’s just an empty room with
the cel of the animation frame.

0:54:50.510,0:54:53.910
Gir: How I would have it is it’s a room
designed for any

0:54:53.910,0:54:57.270
future children I have to find, and then scare
the shit out of them.

0:54:57.270,0:54:59.711
Trog, laughing: Will you just fill it with
like, cartoon

0:54:59.711,0:55:00.900
skeletons or what?

0:55:00.900,0:55:03.849
Gir: I’m gonna fill it with like, really
scary shit, paint

0:55:03.849,0:55:06.590
like “GET OUT” on the walls or something
with something that looks like it

0:55:06.590,0:55:07.590
would’ve been blood.

0:55:07.590,0:55:08.590
Baaulp, laughing: Like a dungeon?

0:55:08.590,0:55:09.590
Wayne: That’s going to go wrong.

0:55:09.590,0:55:10.760
Gir: I want it to—oh no.

0:55:10.760,0:55:11.850
Trog: Nah, it’ll be fine.

0:55:11.850,0:55:12.850
Gir: It’ll be fine.

0:55:12.850,0:55:14.180
Trog: The police will never find it, it’s
a secret room.

0:55:14.180,0:55:16.599
Wayne: Just-just make it a room dedicated
to how much you

0:55:16.599,0:55:17.599
love your son.

0:55:17.599,0:55:19.420
Gir: It’s gonna be like there was a ghost
in there, not like

0:55:19.420,0:55:20.420
someone was murdered.

0:55:20.420,0:55:21.420
[Baaulp laughs]

0:55:21.420,0:55:23.230
Wayne: This is my secret son-love room, I
can’t-I can’t show

0:55:23.230,0:55:24.230
you this.

0:55:24.230,0:55:25.230
Baaulp: Ohh, that sounds wrong.

0:55:25.230,0:55:27.800
Trog: Make it a room devoted to how much you
love your son,

0:55:27.800,0:55:31.520
but it’s not pictures of your son, it’s
like, some other kid.

0:55:31.520,0:55:34.720
[Wayne laughs hard as Log, Trog and Baaulp
join in]

0:55:34.720,0:55:35.991
Wayne: Okay that-that is the ultimate-that
is like the

0:55:35.991,0:55:39.930
ultimate mind fuck for your future child it’s
like, this—okay, now is it the

0:55:39.930,0:55:41.319
same name or a different name?

0:55:41.319,0:55:42.430
Trog: Different name, like it’s a-it’s
a completely

0:55:42.430,0:55:43.430
different kid.

0:55:43.430,0:55:44.430
Wayne: Oh man.

0:55:44.430,0:55:45.430
Baaulp: “Who’s Tanner?”

0:55:45.430,0:55:46.430
Wayne: “I love my son, Jimmy.”

0:55:46.430,0:55:48.630
And it’s just like a stock
blonde kid, like—

0:55:48.630,0:55:49.630
Trog: Yeah.

0:55:49.630,0:55:50.630
Wayne: Ah man, that is so good.

0:55:50.630,0:55:52.270
Trog: Drive your kid crazy.

0:55:52.270,0:55:55.160
Log: The first time that they see the room
it’s got all the

0:55:55.160,0:55:57.170
stuff dedicated to their new son.

0:55:57.170,0:56:01.359
The second time that they go to it, you’ve
removed all the pictures and stuff and you’ve

0:56:01.359,0:56:02.510
just placed the new son there.

0:56:02.510,0:56:04.369
Trog, laughing: There’s just a new kid there.

0:56:04.369,0:56:06.720
There’s a kid
there growing in a tube.

0:56:06.720,0:56:08.942
[Log, Baaulp, and Wayne laugh]

0:56:08.942,0:56:09.942
Wayne, still laughing: Oh my god.

0:56:09.942,0:56:10.942
Trog: I’m growing my new son.

0:56:10.942,0:56:11.950
Wayne: Even if-even if it was just a prop
of

0:56:11.950,0:56:15.730
that—Even if it was just a prop of like,
a test tube baby, and like, it had

0:56:15.730,0:56:17.190
like bubbles in it and shit, oh man.

0:56:17.190,0:56:18.190
Trog: Yeah.

0:56:18.190,0:56:21.400
Baaulp: Make a real mindfuck for your kid,
have pictures of

0:56:21.400,0:56:24.960
a different kid and have different—pictures
of a different father.

0:56:24.960,0:56:25.960
[Everyone laughs]

0:56:25.960,0:56:29.060
Trog: Yeah, make him think that he went to
fucking Narnia,

0:56:29.060,0:56:30.829
like it’s just a different reality.

0:56:30.829,0:56:33.150
Gir: No, cause then that’s like, “Oh,
mom and dad bought

0:56:33.150,0:56:36.589
this house from someone else, someone else’s
family pictures are in here.”

0:56:36.589,0:56:37.589
That
just changes it.

0:56:37.589,0:56:39.900
Wayne: No, no, you have to put some kind of
evidence

0:56:39.900,0:56:41.040
that makes it absolutely you.

0:56:41.040,0:56:43.800
Gir: Yeah, what you need is one picture of
the kid that’s

0:56:43.800,0:56:44.800
like, “Oh, my favorite son.”

0:56:44.800,0:56:48.369
And then another picture of your kid that
says, “Second favorite.”

0:56:48.369,0:56:50.210
[Baaulp, Log, Trog, and Wayne laugh]

0:56:50.210,0:56:51.609
Log: Anyways, I wanna live on a spaceship.

0:56:51.609,0:56:53.230
Baaulp: Yeah, that’d be fuckin’ sick.

0:56:53.230,0:56:54.230
Wayne: Yeah.

0:56:54.230,0:56:55.760
When I was a kid the ultimate dream was to
have

0:56:55.760,0:56:57.079
a room with no gravity.

0:56:57.079,0:56:58.079
[Baaulp laughs]

0:56:58.079,0:57:01.440
Log: I think that I’m kind of doing the
question wrong,

0:57:01.440,0:57:07.280
though, ‘cause I wanna live on like, a spaceship,
but it has to be a spaceship

0:57:07.280,0:57:08.280
in the future.

0:57:08.280,0:57:09.280
Trog: Okay.

0:57:09.280,0:57:10.280
Yeah, no, that’s fair.

0:57:10.280,0:57:11.280
I-I getcha.

0:57:11.280,0:57:12.640
Gir: Well it’s your dream house, not your
reality house.

0:57:12.640,0:57:14.330
Baaulp: Yeah, you want like Star Trek shit.

0:57:14.330,0:57:17.049
Log: It has to be a spaceship in the future,
and I have to

0:57:17.049,0:57:21.369
have a crew, and we have to sail to thousands
of wacky planets throughout the

0:57:21.369,0:57:22.369
solar system.

0:57:22.369,0:57:23.369
[Wayne laughs]

0:57:23.369,0:57:24.369
Baaulp: You want Star Trek!

0:57:24.369,0:57:26.730
They-they made a show about
that, it’s called Star Trek!

0:57:26.730,0:57:28.150
There’s like a fuck ton of it.

0:57:28.150,0:57:29.620
Log: Yeah, but I want it to—

0:57:29.620,0:57:30.840
Wayne: Have you heard of Star Wars?

0:57:30.840,0:57:33.310
Log: —I want it to be like, for fun, and
not for terror.

0:57:33.310,0:57:34.609
Baaulp: Star Trek is fun!

0:57:34.609,0:57:35.609
Log: Not for them.

0:57:35.609,0:57:36.609
Gir: Sometimes.

0:57:36.609,0:57:38.431
Baaulp: Oh yeah, I guess a lotta people die
in Star

0:57:38.431,0:57:39.431
Trek, huh.

0:57:39.431,0:57:41.990
Trog: No, Star Trek is fun for everybody who
not in

0:57:41.990,0:57:42.990
Starfleet.

0:57:42.990,0:57:45.210
Star Trek is a show about like, a utopian
society.

0:57:45.210,0:57:46.210
Gir: That’s true.

0:57:46.210,0:57:47.210
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:57:47.210,0:57:49.099
Wayne: What about the scene where they fight
a lizard?

0:57:49.099,0:57:50.650
That
was not very utopian.

0:57:50.650,0:57:53.609
Trog: I mean, that like, just don’t join
Starfleet.

0:57:53.609,0:57:55.940
Just
live on Earth and be in a utopian society.

0:57:55.940,0:57:56.940
[Wayne laughs]

0:57:56.940,0:57:58.420
Gir: Yeah, you do what I did!

0:57:58.420,0:57:59.763
Baaulp: They’re the ones going out and like,
doing crazy

0:57:59.763,0:58:00.763
shit.

0:58:00.763,0:58:02.890
Gir: You live in the middle of nowhere in
utopia and then—

0:58:02.890,0:58:03.890
Trog: Yeah exactly.

0:58:03.890,0:58:05.099
Gir: —you just also have a holodeck in your
house.

0:58:05.099,0:58:06.099
Baaulp: Yeah, you—Yeah!

0:58:06.099,0:58:08.450
They have a holodeck on the ship,
they probably have even bigger ones on Earth!

0:58:08.450,0:58:09.450
Wayne: They probably have [unintelligible].

0:58:09.450,0:58:10.650
Baaulp: That like, tons of people can be in!

0:58:10.650,0:58:11.700
Gir: They have a holoroom.

0:58:11.700,0:58:14.320
Trog: You think you can fit a big holodeck
on a spaceship?

0:58:14.320,0:58:16.280
Imagine one the size of like uh, an airplane
hangar.

0:58:16.280,0:58:20.030
Log: But yeah, I wanna cool spaceship and
I want to have a

0:58:20.030,0:58:25.170
crew, but we’re not the Starteam, so nobody
like handles irradiated artifacts

0:58:25.170,0:58:28.049
and dies within two minutes like those guys.

0:58:28.049,0:58:29.049
[Wayne laughs]

0:58:29.049,0:58:30.049
Log: You know what I’m talking about.

0:58:30.049,0:58:32.000
Gir: No one gets killed by a sludge monster.

0:58:32.000,0:58:34.570
Baaulp: Do you sail around doing nothing?

0:58:34.570,0:58:40.890
Log: Uh, no, we-we drop on planet Me-Peemon
or whatever and

0:58:40.890,0:58:45.910
there’s little green men that uh, construct
lively, fascinating buildings that

0:58:45.910,0:58:46.910
move.

0:58:46.910,0:58:47.910
[Wayne laughs]

0:58:47.910,0:58:48.910
Trog: And they teach you how to fusion dance.

0:58:48.910,0:58:50.829
Wayne: Did you have the Peemen conjured up
in your head when

0:58:50.829,0:58:51.829
you were a child as well?

0:58:51.829,0:58:52.829
[Trog laughs]

0:58:52.829,0:58:53.829
Wayne: Was that part of the plan?

0:58:53.829,0:58:55.730
Log: Well, no, ‘cause I came up with my
dream home today.

0:58:55.730,0:58:56.730
Wayne: Oh.

0:58:56.730,0:58:57.730
[Log laughs]

0:58:57.730,0:58:58.740
Wayne: Then you answered the question wrong.

0:58:58.740,0:59:00.640
Trog: No, the question is just, “What’s
your dreamhouse,” it

0:59:00.640,0:59:02.630
doesn’t say, “What’s your dreamhouse
when you were a kid.”

0:59:02.630,0:59:03.630
Wayne: I know.

0:59:03.630,0:59:05.829
This was my spin on the question, I got mad
at you earlier for doing this.

0:59:05.829,0:59:08.890
Baaulp: You guys need to crack open some architecture
books.

0:59:08.890,0:59:13.589
My dream home would be in the city, I can’t
not be in the city, it’s

0:59:13.589,0:59:15.970
just way too convenient to live in the city.

0:59:15.970,0:59:18.290
I couldn’t be like Gir and live in
the middle of nowhere.

0:59:18.290,0:59:21.349
So would be in the city, but the four outer
perimeters

0:59:21.349,0:59:24.650
of my home—there wouldn’t be a yard, it
would just be metal.

0:59:24.650,0:59:29.059
The top is open to
let like, rain and like sunlight through,

0:59:29.059,0:59:32.560
and there’s an entrance that’s like,
secret that you have to like, open it up,

0:59:32.560,0:59:37.390
and inside would be like a Japanese
pagoda ‘cause I really like water features,

0:59:37.390,0:59:39.839
I think best in the shower.

0:59:39.839,0:59:43.530
I want
like, a little like water fall thing in the

0:59:43.530,0:59:47.880
center of the home, and then like
along the perimeter of the square would be

0:59:47.880,0:59:50.270
like just rooms and shit, I don’t
know.

0:59:50.270,0:59:54.030
Trog: So you-you want a Japanese pagoda trapped
in like, a

0:59:54.030,0:59:55.030
metal dungeon?

0:59:55.030,0:59:58.349
Baaulp: Yeah, but the top is open so like,
rain and sunlight

0:59:58.349,0:59:59.349
can still shine through.

0:59:59.349,1:00:00.950
Wayne: Yeah, I can imagine this perfectly.

1:00:00.950,1:00:02.910
Trog: What is-but what is the perimeter for
then?

1:00:02.910,1:00:03.910
Wayne: For rooms!

1:00:03.910,1:00:06.430
Baaulp: I think a home like that would be
absolutely sick.

1:00:06.430,1:00:07.430
Wayne: It would, I agree.

1:00:07.430,1:00:09.820
Baaulp: And the metal’s there so that it’s
like, to everyone

1:00:09.820,1:00:12.450
else on the outside it looks scary, so no
one wants to fuck with it—

1:00:12.450,1:00:13.450
Trog: Okay.

1:00:13.450,1:00:14.740
Baaulp: —which means you can get peace and
quiet, but it’s

1:00:14.740,1:00:15.750
all nice and serene on the inside.

1:00:15.750,1:00:17.700
Gir: Too bad you live in the city!

1:00:17.700,1:00:19.830
Wayne: The other way you could approach that
as well is

1:00:19.830,1:00:23.270
like, the tower towards the end of uh, Metal
Gear Rising, where they have like,

1:00:23.270,1:00:25.720
the Japanese garden on like the top floor.

1:00:25.720,1:00:26.720
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:00:26.720,1:00:28.180
Wayne: If you had to do that in a skyscraper-type
situation,

1:00:28.180,1:00:29.180
that would also work.

1:00:29.180,1:00:30.180
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:00:30.180,1:00:31.530
Wayne: I like the idea of having it be a circle,
where you

1:00:31.530,1:00:35.349
c-you have access to that pagoda like area
from anywhere, that would be great.

1:00:35.349,1:00:36.569
Baaulp: Yeah, that’s why I like it.

1:00:36.569,1:00:38.760
I like having a nice
thing to-to look at.

1:00:38.760,1:00:41.970
Like a little bit of nature in the inside
of your home.

1:00:41.970,1:00:44.310
Gir: I-I take issue with your dreamhouse because
you want it

1:00:44.310,1:00:47.800
to be nice and peaceful and serene but you’re
still in the city, so you’re

1:00:47.800,1:00:50.569
gonna be sittin’ there thinking about all
the nice, calm things and you hear a

1:00:50.569,1:00:51.569
fucking police siren.

1:00:51.569,1:00:52.670
Wayne: No, there’s a glass dome.

1:00:52.670,1:00:53.670
Trog: Oh, it’s biodome now.

1:00:53.670,1:00:56.569
Baaulp: But why do you think it’s encased
in fucking metal.

1:00:56.569,1:00:57.569
Gir: To keep you in.

1:00:57.569,1:00:58.859
Trog: But you said the roof is open?

1:00:58.859,1:01:00.980
Wayne: Yo, let me live in Sandy’s treehouse.

1:01:00.980,1:01:03.960
Baaulp: Eh, can’t have a perfect everyth…
[laughs] Even my

1:01:03.960,1:01:04.960
perfect dream home!

1:01:04.960,1:01:05.960
[Gir laughs]

1:01:05.960,1:01:06.960
Gir: You can’t have a perfect dream home!

1:01:06.960,1:01:07.960
Trog: Even my dreamhouse isn’t perfect!

1:01:07.960,1:01:08.960
My imagination is
broken!

1:01:08.960,1:01:10.400
[Baaulp, Gir, and Wayne laugh]

1:01:10.400,1:01:12.210
Trog: Help me, please.

1:01:12.210,1:01:16.180
Wayne: I want to push the idea of a dome in
this dreamhouse.

1:01:16.180,1:01:19.230
I think any kind of house being in a dome
would be pretty sick.

1:01:19.230,1:01:20.230
Trog: That would be.

1:01:20.230,1:01:21.230
I agree.

1:01:21.230,1:01:22.230
Gir: You know what?

1:01:22.230,1:01:23.230
Yeah, take my house…

1:01:23.230,1:01:24.230
put it in a fuckin’
dome.

1:01:24.230,1:01:25.230
Wayne, laughing: Put it in—for no reason.

1:01:25.230,1:01:26.230
Trog: Yeah.

1:01:26.230,1:01:27.230
Wayne, still laughing: Just a dome.

1:01:27.230,1:01:28.230
Gir: So nobody bugs me.

1:01:28.230,1:01:29.230
Baaulp, laughing: Would there be a dome over
the lake?

1:01:29.230,1:01:30.770
Trog: And Pauly Shore is there.

1:01:30.770,1:01:31.770
[Baaulp laughs harder]

1:01:31.770,1:01:33.380
Gir: There’s a door on the dome-there’s
a door on the dome.

1:01:33.380,1:01:35.880
Baaulp: Oh no, we’ve taken Gir’s dream
home and turned it

1:01:35.880,1:01:36.880
into a nightmare.

1:01:36.880,1:01:38.609
Trog: It goes from dream home to nightmare
home.

1:01:38.609,1:01:40.230
Gir: No, he’s there, but he’s in his coffin.

1:01:40.230,1:01:41.230
Wayne: Alright, so yeah, we’ve—

1:01:41.230,1:01:42.230
Baaulp: Oh, fuck.

1:01:42.230,1:01:43.480
Wayne: —we’ve talked about our dream homes,
what’s your

1:01:43.480,1:01:44.480
nightmare home?

1:01:44.480,1:01:45.480
Trog, laughing: Alright.

1:01:45.480,1:01:48.539
Nightmare home, full of used heroin
needles uh—

1:01:48.539,1:01:50.079
Wayne, laughing: Oh no.

1:01:50.079,1:01:51.789
Trog: —snakes in every pillowcase.

1:01:51.789,1:01:54.109
Wayne: Pets that I can’t remember.

1:01:54.109,1:01:57.039
Trog, laughing: All my pets that died come
back to life and

1:01:57.039,1:01:58.039
haunt me.

1:01:58.039,1:01:59.050
Gir: A box in the sewer.

1:01:59.050,1:02:00.990
Log: Every step is a new trapdoor.

1:02:00.990,1:02:01.990
[Wayne laughs]

1:02:01.990,1:02:04.520
Wayne: Oh man I would have tons trapdoors
in my dreamhouse,

1:02:04.520,1:02:05.520
though.

1:02:05.520,1:02:06.530
But I know where they are, so it’s not a
problem.

1:02:06.530,1:02:08.400
Gir: All the doors lead to somewhere different.

1:02:08.400,1:02:09.890
Trog: Carpets made out of Legos.

1:02:09.890,1:02:12.040
Baaulp: My nightmare home would be—it would
look like a

1:02:12.040,1:02:15.579
normal home at first, but you can’t pick
anything up, and then when you open

1:02:15.579,1:02:18.579
the front door it just leads into a mirror
of the same home.

1:02:18.579,1:02:19.579
[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

1:02:19.579,1:02:21.290
Wayne: Alright, alright, new important feature
in my dream

1:02:21.290,1:02:22.290
home.

1:02:22.290,1:02:24.549
I need walls that I can destroy with punches
that will rebuild

1:02:24.549,1:02:25.549
themselves.

1:02:25.549,1:02:26.549
[Baaulp laughs]

1:02:26.549,1:02:27.549
Trog: Okay, yeah.

1:02:27.549,1:02:28.549
No, that’s good.

1:02:28.549,1:02:29.549
I like that.

1:02:29.549,1:02:30.549
Wayne: Alright, next question.

1:02:30.549,1:02:31.549
Trog: We should just start an architecture
podcast of like,

1:02:31.549,1:02:32.549
why don’t these cool things exist?

1:02:32.549,1:02:33.549
[Wayne laughs]

1:02:33.549,1:02:34.549
Trog: [Crosstalk] Why can’t I have my dome
home?

1:02:34.549,1:02:35.549
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Why can’t I do this?

1:02:35.549,1:02:36.990
Why can’t my-why
can’t my house be in a dome and fly?

1:02:36.990,1:02:38.660
Why can’t there be a room with no gravity?

1:02:38.660,1:02:40.700
Gir: Why aren’t there self-repairing walls?

1:02:40.700,1:02:41.700
[Trog laughs]

1:02:41.700,1:02:44.660
Trog: Got a question from Hana here, who asks,
“If you had

1:02:44.660,1:02:48.670
the opportunity to see anyone in concert for
free, who would you go to see?”

1:02:48.670,1:02:49.670
Gir: Weird Al.

1:02:49.670,1:02:50.670
Baaulp: Alive or dead?

1:02:50.670,1:02:51.670
Can we pick dead people?

1:02:51.670,1:02:54.410
Trog: Y’know, there—It does not specify,
so I believe this

1:02:54.410,1:02:55.970
is as open-ended as you want it to be.

1:02:55.970,1:02:56.970
Baaulp and Gir: [Crosstalk] Oh.

1:02:56.970,1:02:57.970
Gir: Oh, Frank Sinatra.

1:02:57.970,1:02:58.970
Trog: Really.

1:02:58.970,1:02:59.970
Gir: Yeah.

1:02:59.970,1:03:00.970
Trog: Why?

1:03:00.970,1:03:01.970
Gir: I like Frank Sinatra!

1:03:01.970,1:03:02.970
Wayne: Nujabes.

1:03:02.970,1:03:03.970
Trog: That’s fair.

1:03:03.970,1:03:04.970
Wayne: My answer’s too easy, the same reason
for me.

1:03:04.970,1:03:05.970
I-I
love Nujabes and he’s dead, and I can never

1:03:05.970,1:03:06.970
see him in concert.

1:03:06.970,1:03:07.970
Trog: Yeah, that would be a really cool show.

1:03:07.970,1:03:09.750
Log: Yeah, I want to do that, too.

1:03:09.750,1:03:11.720
So, that makes it not
that funny, though.

1:03:11.720,1:03:14.520
Trog: Well, y’know, not every question has
to be

1:03:14.520,1:03:15.520
funny.

1:03:15.520,1:03:17.480
Log: There’s also not too much to discuss
about it, it’s

1:03:17.480,1:03:19.270
like, “Yeah, Nujabes is dead, and he’s
great.”

1:03:19.270,1:03:20.270
Wayne: Because I like him.

1:03:20.270,1:03:21.270
Log: Yeah.

1:03:21.270,1:03:22.270
Wayne: Like, yeah.

1:03:22.270,1:03:23.270
Log: I mean, no-no argument there.

1:03:23.270,1:03:25.940
Trog: Not every question has to take thirty
minutes to

1:03:25.940,1:03:28.410
answer ‘cause we go off on wild tangents.

1:03:28.410,1:03:29.770
Sometimes people might just want a
damn answer to their question!

1:03:29.770,1:03:30.770
Wanye: [Crosstalk] It’s true!

1:03:30.770,1:03:31.920
Trog: Baaulp, what’s your answer?

1:03:31.920,1:03:33.589
Who would you like to see
in concert for free?

1:03:33.589,1:03:34.589
Baaulp: Devo.

1:03:34.589,1:03:35.589
Trog: Devo?

1:03:35.589,1:03:36.589
That would be good.

1:03:36.589,1:03:37.589
Wayne: Ohh, that’s not bad.

1:03:37.589,1:03:38.589
Trog: Like, prime-prime time Devo.

1:03:38.589,1:03:40.860
Baaulp: Yeah, like Devo when like, they were
all-I mean,

1:03:40.860,1:03:45.331
they’re old, and like—Well, actually two
of them died, so-which is like, also a

1:03:45.331,1:03:46.331
good reason.

1:03:46.331,1:03:47.331
‘Cause two of them died, I don’t think
they’re really

1:03:47.331,1:03:51.819
touring-gonna be touring anymore, but they—Like,
even as old men, they go

1:03:51.819,1:03:52.819
fucking hard.

1:03:52.819,1:03:55.109
Wayne: And then on the opposite side of things,
I saw a

1:03:55.109,1:03:59.029
Journey-uh, a Journey reunion concert and
uh, they did not go hard.

1:03:59.029,1:04:00.029
[Trog laughs]

1:04:00.029,1:04:02.630
Gir: Aw, they-are they really not that good
anymore?

1:04:02.630,1:04:04.550
Wayne, laughing: They did not have it in them
anymore.

1:04:04.550,1:04:05.550
Trog: My answer—

1:04:05.550,1:04:06.670
Wayne, in a singing voice: Juke Box Hero.

1:04:06.670,1:04:10.380
Trog: —also not very funny, and maybe a
little strange but,

1:04:10.380,1:04:13.549
honestly, the first thing that came to my
mind was Neil Cicierega.

1:04:13.549,1:04:15.200
I would like
to see Neil Cicierega in concert.

1:04:15.200,1:04:16.200
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Oh, yeah.

1:04:16.200,1:04:20.059
Trog: I really liked his last Lemon Demon
album, and he has

1:04:20.059,1:04:23.770
a bunch of funny mashups that would probably
be a fun little thing to play

1:04:23.770,1:04:24.770
live.

1:04:24.770,1:04:25.770
I think it’d be a fun concert, all around.

1:04:25.770,1:04:26.770
Gir: I think I’m old.

1:04:26.770,1:04:28.680
Baaulp: It’s okay that we answered this
really quick, but I

1:04:28.680,1:04:31.809
do have a quick tangent that I really just
thought of.

1:04:31.809,1:04:34.220
Why didn’t we pick like,
an ancient thing?

1:04:34.220,1:04:36.690
Like, can you imagine like—I pick cavemen!

1:04:36.690,1:04:39.829
I want to see what
a caveman concert was like!

1:04:39.829,1:04:41.020
Wayne: The-the first musician.

1:04:41.020,1:04:44.640
Log: I thought about talking about cavemen,
but Nujabes was the

1:04:44.640,1:04:45.640
obvious choice.

1:04:45.640,1:04:47.609
Could hear something that I’ve never heard
before, and nobody’s

1:04:47.609,1:04:48.609
heard before—

1:04:48.609,1:04:49.609
Gir: I want to see Mozart.

1:04:49.609,1:04:51.970
Log: —could be just stupid as fuck, but…

1:04:51.970,1:04:54.410
Wayne: I want-I want to turn this back around
again.

1:04:54.410,1:04:56.369
So, we
picked artists that are dead.

1:04:56.369,1:04:57.369
Trog: Well, I didn’t.

1:04:57.369,1:04:59.599
Wayne: If we have these magic concert powers,
we could also

1:04:59.599,1:05:01.440
pick artists that don’t exist.

1:05:01.440,1:05:02.440
Baaulp: Oh shit.

1:05:02.440,1:05:04.200
Wayne: But-but because that would just be
stupid, ‘cause we

1:05:04.200,1:05:05.200
can just say whatever we want—

1:05:05.200,1:05:06.200
Baaulp: Zarknon the Embarrassed.

1:05:06.200,1:05:08.049
Wayne: I want the guy who sings Scrod on YouTube.

1:05:08.049,1:05:09.049
Trog: Oooh, yeah.

1:05:09.049,1:05:10.049
Wayne, singing: Scrod.

1:05:10.049,1:05:12.400
Log: I’ll tell you, I’ve looked at his
channel since then,

1:05:12.400,1:05:14.070
you don’t want to see him in concert.

1:05:14.070,1:05:15.070
Trog: Oh no.

1:05:15.070,1:05:16.070
Wayne: Oh, really?

1:05:16.070,1:05:17.070
Log: Yeah.

1:05:17.070,1:05:19.740
I mean like, I can’t… really describe
what his

1:05:19.740,1:05:25.319
songs are about now, uh, one of them was about
how Donald Trump Jr. was a robot

1:05:25.319,1:05:26.560
baby or something.

1:05:26.560,1:05:27.560
Trog: Alrighty.

1:05:27.560,1:05:29.599
Wayne: Well then I’ll-I’ll change my answer,
and I want the

1:05:29.599,1:05:30.750
guys who did Junior Spesh.

1:05:30.750,1:05:31.750
Log and Trog: Yeah.

1:05:31.750,1:05:34.160
Wayne: And these will both be in the description
if you have no idea what I’m talking about,

1:05:34.160,1:05:37.440
uh, these will be part of the Videos of the
Times for our description.

1:05:37.440,1:05:39.010
Gir: I want Scary Al Yankovic.

1:05:39.010,1:05:40.650
[Trog, Baaulp, and Wayne laugh]

1:05:40.650,1:05:43.970
Gir: It’s one of the alternate universe
versions of Weird Al

1:05:43.970,1:05:44.970
Yankovic.

1:05:44.970,1:05:45.970
[Wayne laughs]

1:05:45.970,1:05:46.970
Wayne: What does he sing about?

1:05:46.970,1:05:48.400
Gir: I don’t know but it’s really scary.

1:05:48.400,1:05:50.490
Wayne, laughing: The scariest concert imaginable.

1:05:50.490,1:05:52.530
He’s just
got knives and he’s throwing them into the

1:05:52.530,1:05:53.549
crowd and he’s wailing.

1:05:53.549,1:05:54.549
Gir: Yeah.

1:05:54.549,1:05:55.549
[Baaulp laughs]

1:05:55.549,1:05:57.299
Gir: Every universe has their own version
of Al Yankovic.

1:05:57.299,1:05:59.329
We
got weird, someone got scary, someone’s

1:05:59.329,1:06:00.329
got sad—

1:06:00.329,1:06:01.779
Wayne: And he’s also not necessarily good,
either.

1:06:01.779,1:06:03.010
He’s
singing Michael Jackson, “I’m Bad,”

1:06:03.010,1:06:05.890
like, y’know Weird Al Yankovic has, “I’m
Fat,” he’s just going, “I’m scary!

1:06:05.890,1:06:06.890
I’m scary!”

1:06:06.890,1:06:08.470
And he’s throwing knives into
the crowds.

1:06:08.470,1:06:09.470
[Everyone laughs]

1:06:09.470,1:06:12.310
Gir: No, he’s singing, “I’m Bad,”
but there’s no music, he’s

1:06:12.310,1:06:15.810
just on screen—on-on stage screaming, “I’m
bad!

1:06:15.810,1:06:16.810
I’m bad!”

1:06:16.810,1:06:17.810
[Wayne chants with Gir]

1:06:17.810,1:06:18.810
Gir: Everyone’s crying.

1:06:18.810,1:06:20.070
Wayne: One bad guy up here.

1:06:20.070,1:06:23.000
This is kind of similar to the
Hitman question earlier, but Frisbee, our

1:06:23.000,1:06:26.299
good friend Frisbee, father Frisbee
asks, “If there was a WayneRadioTV battle

1:06:26.299,1:06:27.299
royale, who would win?”

1:06:27.299,1:06:28.690
Gir: Well, y’never know, it’s a battle
royale.

1:06:28.690,1:06:29.690
Trog: Hmm…

1:06:29.690,1:06:30.690
Who all is in it?

1:06:30.690,1:06:32.750
Like, everyone who’s ever been
on a stream?

1:06:32.750,1:06:35.991
Wayne: That’s the problem, is, I think the
crew, which

1:06:35.991,1:06:38.160
is—yeah, the stream crew, I guess.

1:06:38.160,1:06:40.339
Trog: That’s like a-that’s y’know, that’s
a pretty decent

1:06:40.339,1:06:41.339
number of people.

1:06:41.339,1:06:42.369
Baaulp: I would win.

1:06:42.369,1:06:43.369
Trog: Oh.

1:06:43.369,1:06:44.369
Wow.

1:06:44.369,1:06:45.369
Wayne: Why?

1:06:45.369,1:06:46.369
How could you best me?

1:06:46.369,1:06:47.369
Baaulp: Uhh…

1:06:47.369,1:06:48.369
Gir: He’d beat you.

1:06:48.369,1:06:49.369
Baaulp: ‘Cause I’d find a gun before you
[laughs] and shoot

1:06:49.369,1:06:50.369
you.

1:06:50.369,1:06:51.369
[Wayne and Trog laugh]

1:06:51.369,1:06:52.369
Wayne, still laughing: I guess.

1:06:52.369,1:06:53.369
Y’know, I guess.

1:06:53.369,1:06:54.369
I suck at
battle royale games, so…

1:06:54.369,1:06:55.369
Trog: Yeah I was about to say, I don’t think
I would last

1:06:55.369,1:06:56.369
very long.

1:06:56.369,1:06:57.369
Wayne: If it’s like that kind of battle
royale—

1:06:57.369,1:06:58.369
Baaulp: If we’re thinking like Fortnite
and PUBG then I

1:06:58.369,1:06:59.369
mean, like, I found a gun, I-I shoot you.

1:06:59.369,1:07:00.369
[Wayne laughs]

1:07:00.369,1:07:01.369
Wayne: Damn!

1:07:01.369,1:07:02.369
Baaulp: It-it’s not even skill!

1:07:02.369,1:07:05.530
Gir: I found a gun.

1:07:05.530,1:07:06.530
I shoot you.

1:07:06.530,1:07:08.490
Wayne: Y’know you-this is like playground
rules, you said

1:07:08.490,1:07:11.600
that first, so I can’t like, I can’t say
like, “No, but I picked up a gun and

1:07:11.600,1:07:12.600
got you, too!”

1:07:12.600,1:07:13.809
Like that’s-that’d be bad manners.

1:07:13.809,1:07:15.410
Gir: But I-I shot you harder!

1:07:15.410,1:07:17.960
Log: Yeah, well, you could say that you deflected
it.

1:07:17.960,1:07:19.200
Wayne, laughing: Oh, I deflected it.

1:07:19.200,1:07:21.069
Oh, I drank a chug
juice.

1:07:21.069,1:07:22.329
[Log, Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:07:22.329,1:07:23.680
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] I get in a Jeep and drive
away!

1:07:23.680,1:07:24.680
Trog: [Crosstalk] Look, we’re not going
to devolve this

1:07:24.680,1:07:26.500
podcast into roleplaying a battle royale,
okay?

1:07:26.500,1:07:28.810
Gir: I would hide, and then wait for the last
person.

1:07:28.810,1:07:31.790
Wayne: Alright, now I-now I-now I-Now I unsheath
my blade of

1:07:31.790,1:07:32.930
a thousand lights.

1:07:32.930,1:07:34.670
Baaulp: My dad bought me V-Bucks.

1:07:34.670,1:07:35.670
[Trog laughs]

1:07:35.670,1:07:36.740
Wayne: Oh, that just makes you look cool.

1:07:36.740,1:07:38.779
You don’t get an
advantage from V-Bucks, you fuck.

1:07:38.779,1:07:40.450
Trog: That’s what you think, that’s what
they try-that’s

1:07:40.450,1:07:42.070
what they try to tell you, but—

1:07:42.070,1:07:43.070
[Wayne laughs]

1:07:43.070,1:07:45.289
Trog: —the V-Bucks are important to your
power.

1:07:45.289,1:07:47.170
Gir: You think I wear this chicken suit for
fun?

1:07:47.170,1:07:49.090
Wayne: I think Scorpy would be very hard to
deal

1:07:49.090,1:07:50.090
with.

1:07:50.090,1:07:51.090
Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

1:07:51.090,1:07:52.090
Scorpy would like, set up a kill house.

1:07:52.090,1:07:53.090
Wayne: Yeah.

1:07:53.090,1:07:54.090
His tactics would be very unorthodox.

1:07:54.090,1:07:56.569
Trog: His level of guerrilla warfare would
be unmatched.

1:07:56.569,1:07:59.559
He
would attack you in ways that you-we can’t

1:07:59.559,1:08:01.110
even comprehend at this moment.

1:08:01.110,1:08:03.530
Gir: I think he’d get confused very easily
and then we could

1:08:03.530,1:08:04.530
kill him.

1:08:04.530,1:08:07.569
Trog: I got a question from MissFroggish here,
who asks,

1:08:07.569,1:08:10.640
“What’s the most bizarre thing you’d
willingly eat?”

1:08:10.640,1:08:11.640
Wayne: Shampoo.

1:08:11.640,1:08:13.859
Baaulp: I’d have to abstain from this question.

1:08:13.859,1:08:15.310
Wayne: Where do we draw the line?

1:08:15.310,1:08:16.360
Trog: You draw the line.

1:08:16.360,1:08:18.990
It’s what’s the most bizarre thing you
would willingly eat!

1:08:18.990,1:08:19.990
Gir: Hmm.

1:08:19.990,1:08:22.270
Baaulp: I will say this, let’s limit it
to [sighs] to food,

1:08:22.270,1:08:23.270
‘cause then—

1:08:23.270,1:08:24.429
Gir: Nonpoisonous substances.

1:08:24.429,1:08:26.880
Baaulp: We—If we don’t to that then we’ll
get like, a Mega

1:08:26.880,1:08:29.890
64 Christmas cast question where it’s like,
“Oh, I-yeah, I’d drink my own pee.”

1:08:29.890,1:08:31.409
Wayne: I feel like we’ve answered this already.

1:08:31.409,1:08:32.980
Trog: Have we answered this already?

1:08:32.980,1:08:33.980
Gir: I don’t think so.

1:08:33.980,1:08:35.950
Wayne: I feel like we talked about a very
similar question,

1:08:35.950,1:08:38.359
‘cause I remember we-we were talking about
like, eating poop, at one point.

1:08:38.359,1:08:39.409
[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

1:08:39.409,1:08:41.319
Gir: That was just a conversation we had.

1:08:41.319,1:08:42.319
Wayne: Maybe…

1:08:42.319,1:08:43.319
Gir: That wasn’t recorded.

1:08:43.319,1:08:45.050
Trog: I will say that everybody here, I’m
pretty sure, has

1:08:45.050,1:08:48.890
gone on record in saying that they would eat
some amount of raw beef for

1:08:48.890,1:08:50.120
some amount of money.

1:08:50.120,1:08:51.120
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

1:08:51.120,1:08:52.120
Gir: Oh, I would not.

1:08:52.120,1:08:54.560
Trog: That might just be the blanket answer
for this one.

1:08:54.560,1:08:55.960
Baaulp: That is true.

1:08:55.960,1:08:58.370
It was not recorded anywhere, but what
was the conversation we had?

1:08:58.370,1:09:01.739
I remember saying like, I’d rather eat like
a

1:09:01.739,1:09:03.520
pound of raw meat for twenty bucks.

1:09:03.520,1:09:07.540
Trog: No, I asked, “You get twenty dollars
for every ounce

1:09:07.540,1:09:09.219
of raw meat that you eat.

1:09:09.219,1:09:12.120
How much could you do before you had to stop?

1:09:12.120,1:09:13.600
And if
you throw up, you get no money.”

1:09:13.600,1:09:14.600
Gir: I would decline.

1:09:14.600,1:09:15.600
Trog: That-that was the question.

1:09:15.600,1:09:16.600
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] One pound

1:09:16.600,1:09:17.600
Wayne: [Crosstalk] A pound.

1:09:17.600,1:09:18.600
Trog: [Crosstalk] That was a hypothetical
question I

1:09:18.600,1:09:19.600
proposed like, 6 months ago.

1:09:19.600,1:09:20.600
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Two pounds.

1:09:20.600,1:09:21.600
Wayne: I don’t think you could do two pounds.

1:09:21.600,1:09:23.100
I could do a
pound, I don’t think you could do two pounds.

1:09:23.100,1:09:24.909
Baaulp: Mayb—I might be able to do two pounds.

1:09:24.909,1:09:26.490
Gir: I believe Baaulp could do two.

1:09:26.490,1:09:27.490
Wayne: I don’t know.

1:09:27.490,1:09:28.490
Trog: Without throwing up?

1:09:28.490,1:09:29.690
Wayne: Like, is there a time limit?

1:09:29.690,1:09:30.690
There was a time
limit, wasn’t there?

1:09:30.690,1:09:31.950
Baaulp: There wasn’t a time limit.

1:09:31.950,1:09:33.299
Gir: Two pounds isn’t that much.

1:09:33.299,1:09:34.630
Wayne: Two pounds is a lot of beef!

1:09:34.630,1:09:37.440
Trog: There wasn’t a time limit, but it
was in one sitting

1:09:37.440,1:09:38.589
and you can’t throw up.

1:09:38.589,1:09:41.040
Like, you can’t get up and do something,
you have to

1:09:41.040,1:09:42.040
sit there.

1:09:42.040,1:09:43.040
Wayne: Gir, Gir.

1:09:43.040,1:09:44.949
Most burgers are a-are like a half pound.

1:09:44.949,1:09:45.949
Gir: Yeah.

1:09:45.949,1:09:47.630
Wayne: Like quarter pounder to a half pound,
you are not

1:09:47.630,1:09:49.080
eating two pounds of beef!

1:09:49.080,1:09:51.350
Gir: Imagine those hotdog eating contests
where people are

1:09:51.350,1:09:53.250
eating like, fifteen pounds of food.

1:09:53.250,1:09:55.690
Wayne: Yeah, and they’re cooked, and those
people are also

1:09:55.690,1:09:56.989
trained, professional eaters.

1:09:56.989,1:09:58.650
I’m asking you in your current state—

1:09:58.650,1:09:59.659
Baaulp: Those people must be rich.

1:09:59.659,1:10:01.870
Wayne: You don’t have the hyperbolic time
chamber in this

1:10:01.870,1:10:02.870
fucking scenario!

1:10:02.870,1:10:04.820
Gir: I wouldn’t do it to begin with!

1:10:04.820,1:10:05.953
I ain’t eatin’ no
fuckin’ raw meat!

1:10:05.953,1:10:06.953
Trog: No, you have to do this tomorrow.

1:10:06.953,1:10:08.080
Wayne: YOU NEED TO DO IT NOW!

1:10:08.080,1:10:10.820
When you answer this question,
when you give me-when you give me your answer,

1:10:10.820,1:10:12.699
the beef is going to materialize
in front of you—

1:10:12.699,1:10:13.699
Trog, laughing: It’s going to teleport—

1:10:13.699,1:10:14.699
Wayne: —you have to do it right now!

1:10:14.699,1:10:15.699
Gir: Well it’s a good thing I’m declining!

1:10:15.699,1:10:16.780
I ain’t eating no
raw beef!

1:10:16.780,1:10:18.080
Trog: Alright, there we go.

1:10:18.080,1:10:19.080
Now we know Gir’s answer.

1:10:19.080,1:10:20.810
Wayne: Okay, well then [laughs] well then
no meat will

1:10:20.810,1:10:21.970
appear on your desk today.

1:10:21.970,1:10:22.970
Gir: Thank god.

1:10:22.970,1:10:24.900
Trog: For the record, I would also not do
this for any

1:10:24.900,1:10:25.900
amount of money.

1:10:25.900,1:10:26.900
Gir, laughing: Yeah.

1:10:26.900,1:10:27.900
[Wayne joins in on the laughter]

1:10:27.900,1:10:28.900
Wayne: I think it’s only me and Baaulp.

1:10:28.900,1:10:29.900
[Gir sighs]

1:10:29.900,1:10:30.900
Baaulp: I think—Aw, man.

1:10:30.900,1:10:33.800
I would choose not to, but if
someone—If I was—If it was like a hypothetical

1:10:33.800,1:10:38.960
situation where I had to,
I mean go-go for the gold, right?

1:10:38.960,1:10:40.560
Let’s see if I can down two pounds!

1:10:40.560,1:10:41.560
[Laughs]

1:10:41.560,1:10:42.560
Trog: Well, that’s the thing.

1:10:42.560,1:10:44.150
It’s not a situation where you
have to, it’s a situation where you get

1:10:44.150,1:10:45.150
paid to.

1:10:45.150,1:10:47.130
Gir: You have to take this money for eating
this

1:10:47.130,1:10:48.130
meat.

1:10:48.130,1:10:49.130
Log: I don’t know.

1:10:49.130,1:10:51.580
I don’t think I really need to be eating
raw meat.

1:10:51.580,1:10:52.580
Trog: Exactly.

1:10:52.580,1:10:55.360
Log: If we’re talking hypotheticals, I can
just get my

1:10:55.360,1:10:56.360
spaceship crew—

1:10:56.360,1:10:57.360
Baaulp: Have them eat it!

1:10:57.360,1:11:00.170
Log: I can just get Beemo from my spaceship
crew who is a

1:11:00.170,1:11:01.170
caveman who eats raw meat—

1:11:01.170,1:11:02.540
Trog: [Crosstalk] No you’re crossing the-the
hypothetical

1:11:02.540,1:11:04.200
streams, this isn’t-this isn’t canon anymore.

1:11:04.200,1:11:05.200
[Baaulp laughs]

1:11:05.200,1:11:06.200
Trog: Question’s over.

1:11:06.200,1:11:08.130
Wayne: Our friend Lauren asks, “What was
your favorite toy

1:11:08.130,1:11:09.320
as a wee child?”

1:11:09.320,1:11:10.739
Trog: Hmm.

1:11:10.739,1:11:13.090
Baaulp: I... really liked Legos.

1:11:13.090,1:11:14.280
Gir: [Crosstalk] That’s actually a question.

1:11:14.280,1:11:17.360
Baaulp: Like, I-I-I—At-at a certain point
before I was too

1:11:17.360,1:11:20.940
young for video games, to have like a lot
of video games, I would always just

1:11:20.940,1:11:21.940
ask for Legos.

1:11:21.940,1:11:22.940
I loved that shit.

1:11:22.940,1:11:23.940
I loved bricks.

1:11:23.940,1:11:25.610
Gir: I gotta go with Bionicles.

1:11:25.610,1:11:28.960
Like, to this day I would
still like—the thought of me getting a new

1:11:28.960,1:11:32.900
Bionicle, even like at twenty-five,
for Christmas is like, wow I would love that.

1:11:32.900,1:11:35.601
Baaulp: Dude, you should totally just buy
Bionicles for

1:11:35.601,1:11:36.601
yourself.

1:11:36.601,1:11:38.230
If it still genuinely excites you—

1:11:38.230,1:11:39.719
Trog: They’re not easy to get anymore.

1:11:39.719,1:11:42.211
Gir: They’re not—If I wanted one of the
old ones like, when

1:11:42.211,1:11:45.580
I was actually a child, it would be like,
two hundred dollars.

1:11:45.580,1:11:46.580
Baaulp: [Crosstalk[ Ohhhh.

1:11:46.580,1:11:47.580
Trog: Yeah, those things are expensive.

1:11:47.580,1:11:48.580
Baaulp: Oh fuck.

1:11:48.580,1:11:50.600
Gir: It’s a Lego product, like, it’s not
cheap.

1:11:50.600,1:11:54.000
Wayne: I like, disproportionately valued a
toy if it was

1:11:54.000,1:11:55.489
from a video game when I was a kid.

1:11:55.489,1:11:56.489
Trog: Yeah.

1:11:56.489,1:11:57.489
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] What do you mean?

1:11:57.489,1:11:58.969
Wayne: I had a Banjo-Kazooie uh, like, stuffed
animal—

1:11:58.969,1:11:59.969
Baaulp: Ohhh.

1:11:59.969,1:12:00.969
Wayne: —that was my favorite.

1:12:00.969,1:12:01.969
Trog: [Crosstalk] Oh, that’s sick.

1:12:01.969,1:12:02.969
I want one of those right
now.

1:12:02.969,1:12:03.969
Wayne: It was so cool!

1:12:03.969,1:12:05.060
I actually—No, it was just Banjo,
‘cause I lost the backpack.

1:12:05.060,1:12:06.060
Trog: Ah.

1:12:06.060,1:12:07.060
Gir: Oh no.

1:12:07.060,1:12:08.060
Wayne: It started as Banjo-Kazooie, but at
some point I lost

1:12:08.060,1:12:09.710
the backpack, but honestly, like that’s
fine.

1:12:09.710,1:12:10.780
Log, laughing: Kazooie died.

1:12:10.780,1:12:11.850
[Gir and Wayne laugh]

1:12:11.850,1:12:12.850
Trog: Oh no.

1:12:12.850,1:12:14.380
Gir: Your parents never told you, but…

1:12:14.380,1:12:16.900
Wayne: Hey, the child inside of me is really
upset, they

1:12:16.900,1:12:17.900
were just in split mode.

1:12:17.900,1:12:19.061
They used the split power up in Twooie.

1:12:19.061,1:12:20.061
Trog: Yeah.

1:12:20.061,1:12:21.061
Log: Forever.

1:12:21.061,1:12:22.061
[Wayne, Gir, and Trog laugh]

1:12:22.061,1:12:23.061
Gir: They split up.

1:12:23.061,1:12:24.710
Wayne: Sometimes partnerships don’t last.

1:12:24.710,1:12:26.340
Log, laughing: That’s what your mom told
you—that’s what

1:12:26.340,1:12:29.710
your mom told you whenever your Kazooie died.

1:12:29.710,1:12:30.710
[Gir laughs]

1:12:30.710,1:12:31.710
Wayne, laughing: My Kazooie.

1:12:31.710,1:12:32.710
Gir: Oh no.

1:12:32.710,1:12:36.440
Baaulp: Does that mean you uh, you loved that
Chunky Kong

1:12:36.440,1:12:37.460
car just as much?

1:12:37.460,1:12:38.460
Or van?

1:12:38.460,1:12:39.739
Wayne: Yeah, I love it so much I don’t know
where it is

1:12:39.739,1:12:40.739
right now.

1:12:40.739,1:12:41.739
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

1:12:41.739,1:12:43.590
Log: Ah, where’s your copy of Elite Beat
Agents?

1:12:43.590,1:12:45.480
Wayne: That is gone, I’m pretty sure.

1:12:45.480,1:12:47.800
No, I think I
have that in a box somewhere.

1:12:47.800,1:12:51.070
Log, you should elaborate on that story and
why-why you brought that up.

1:12:51.070,1:12:54.679
Log: I’ve only been to Connecticut once,
to see Wayne.

1:12:54.679,1:12:56.800
I’ve
seen Wayne more than once, but I’ve only

1:12:56.800,1:12:58.090
been to his house once.

1:12:58.090,1:13:01.550
And whenever was
at his house, we went down to his bedroom,

1:13:01.550,1:13:05.550
and we were—all of us, there were
like five of us, we’re all just chillin’

1:13:05.550,1:13:07.150
down there, and then I looked at his
shelves.

1:13:07.150,1:13:11.489
His shelves were just barren except for a
copy of Elite Beat Agents

1:13:11.489,1:13:13.040
for the Nintendo DS.

1:13:13.040,1:13:14.050
Wayne: Outside of the case.

1:13:14.050,1:13:15.390
[Wayne and Trog laugh]

1:13:15.390,1:13:17.370
Log: Yeah, it’s just on its own.

1:13:17.370,1:13:20.210
Trog: That is an important-that is an important
detail to

1:13:20.210,1:13:21.210
add.

1:13:21.210,1:13:22.210
Gir: Wayne, what the fuck?

1:13:22.210,1:13:24.090
Log: Just outside the case, on its own, only
thing on

1:13:24.090,1:13:25.090
the shelf.

1:13:25.090,1:13:28.020
Wayne: Those shelves were unorganized, and
to be fair, the

1:13:28.020,1:13:29.760
other-the other shelves did have some things
on them.

1:13:29.760,1:13:31.641
You are-you are
exaggerating a little bit.

1:13:31.641,1:13:33.350
Gir: They sounded pretty organized considering
there was one

1:13:33.350,1:13:34.350
thing on them!

1:13:34.350,1:13:35.350
Wayne: Yes.

1:13:35.350,1:13:39.550
One item per shelf, that is a rule, and it
doesn’t matter how small the item is [laughs].

1:13:39.550,1:13:41.900
The, no, I don’t know, man.

1:13:41.900,1:13:43.940
It
just happened, I was done playing it and I’m

1:13:43.940,1:13:45.389
like, “This will go on my shelf
today.”

1:13:45.389,1:13:47.179
Gir: “I will put this up here today.”

1:13:47.179,1:13:49.040
Baaulp: “I won’t put it back in the box!”

1:13:49.040,1:13:51.230
Trog: “And I don’t have the case anymore.”

1:13:51.230,1:13:52.441
Wayne, laughing: I don’t know, I couldn’t
give you my

1:13:52.441,1:13:54.770
legitimate reasoning for why that was there.

1:13:54.770,1:13:57.010
Gir: You didn’t have a legitimate reason,
you just did it.

1:13:57.010,1:13:58.010
Trog: Exactly.

1:13:58.010,1:13:59.380
Wayne: Yes, but it was a very funny—you
pointed it out to me

1:13:59.380,1:14:00.550
and I was just like, “Oh, fuck you.

1:14:00.550,1:14:01.550
Fuck off.”

1:14:01.550,1:14:02.870
Trog: What constitutes a toy, because—

1:14:02.870,1:14:03.960
Gir: Oh, come on.

1:14:03.960,1:14:05.530
Baaulp: We’re about to get a good answer.

1:14:05.530,1:14:07.830
Trog: —if we’re counting video games as
toys, then like, my

1:14:07.830,1:14:10.260
Nintendo 64 would definitely be—

1:14:10.260,1:14:11.460
Gir: Video games aren’t toys.

1:14:11.460,1:14:14.910
Baaulp: We’ll say for this it has to be
a toy that’s not a

1:14:14.910,1:14:15.910
video game.

1:14:15.910,1:14:18.660
Trog: Then yeah, I would say like, probably,
also—not

1:14:18.660,1:14:23.250
Bionicles specifically, I loved Bionicles
and I still do, but like any sort of

1:14:23.250,1:14:24.290
like, building toy.

1:14:24.290,1:14:25.600
I had ‘em all.

1:14:25.600,1:14:32.220
I had like, Bionicles, I had K’Nex, I had
Legos, I had these weird—I don’t even

1:14:32.220,1:14:36.639
know what they’re called, they were like
super weird shaped the gimmick was that like,

1:14:36.639,1:14:39.889
you could pull on them and
they would like, look different.

1:14:39.889,1:14:43.020
I don’t even know, I’m probably describing
this in a really stupid way—

1:14:43.020,1:14:44.020
Gir: Oh, dicks.

1:14:44.020,1:14:45.290
Trog: —but, I literally don’t know what
those are called.

1:14:45.290,1:14:49.719
Yeah, I had a bunch of building toys as a
kid, and honestly, I wish I had Legos

1:14:49.719,1:14:50.719
right now.

1:14:50.719,1:14:51.820
I kinda want Legos for Christmas.

1:14:51.820,1:14:53.230
Wayne: Alright, monkey’s paw.

1:14:53.230,1:14:54.230
You get two Legos, like—

1:14:54.230,1:14:55.230
Trog: Ah, perfect.

1:14:55.230,1:14:56.230
Wayne: —like two bricks.

1:14:56.230,1:14:58.901
Baaulp: Every time I’ve gone to a Lego store
they got you

1:14:58.901,1:14:59.901
down.

1:14:59.901,1:15:00.901
They know what they’re doing.

1:15:00.901,1:15:03.750
There are like, adult Lego kits where
instead of just like, “Oh, here’s a spaceship

1:15:03.750,1:15:04.750
or whatever.”

1:15:04.750,1:15:08.210
It’s like, it’s
like monuments or like, cars or stuff—like

1:15:08.210,1:15:09.270
real deal stuff for adults—

1:15:09.270,1:15:12.110
Trog: Hey, I would absolutely build a spaceship
over like, a

1:15:12.110,1:15:13.110
monument [laughs].

1:15:13.110,1:15:14.110
Baaulp: But they’re so expensive.

1:15:14.110,1:15:15.110
Trog: Yeah.

1:15:15.110,1:15:16.489
Baaulp: There was one for the Eiffel Tower
that looked

1:15:16.489,1:15:18.290
really cool, but it was like fifty bucks!

1:15:18.290,1:15:19.720
Gir: Yeah, Lego ain’t cheap, man.

1:15:19.720,1:15:20.720
Baaulp: I guess not.

1:15:20.720,1:15:24.510
Trog: Yeah, but building toys, many an hour
as a child were

1:15:24.510,1:15:29.250
spent playing with my Bionicles, listening
to the Sonic Adventure Sound Test in

1:15:29.250,1:15:30.250
my bedroom.

1:15:30.250,1:15:31.469
Wayne: Dude, Sound Tests were sick.

1:15:31.469,1:15:32.469
Trog: It was the best.

1:15:32.469,1:15:36.800
I just had all the songs in Sonic
Adventure, aw man, it was like my own jukebox,

1:15:36.800,1:15:37.800
it was great.

1:15:37.800,1:15:39.710
Wayne: When I was a kid, I always though that
like, video

1:15:39.710,1:15:43.550
game-based toys were hard to find, that you
like wouldn’t just find them

1:15:43.550,1:15:45.320
regularly in the store, but I had a surprising
amount of them.

1:15:45.320,1:15:47.550
I had a lot of
Sonic toys.

1:15:47.550,1:15:50.780
Specifically, a separate set of Sonic Adventure
1 and Sonic

1:15:50.780,1:15:51.780
Adventure 2 toys.

1:15:51.780,1:15:53.179
They were different because one had Shadow.

1:15:53.179,1:15:54.179
Trog: How sick.

1:15:54.179,1:15:56.870
Wayne: And the other one didn’t have S—The
other one was

1:15:56.870,1:15:57.870
just Sonic.

1:15:57.870,1:15:59.429
Okay no, acutal-actual favorite toy, E-102
toy.

1:15:59.429,1:16:00.429
I actually had
that.

1:16:00.429,1:16:01.429
Trog: Really?

1:16:01.429,1:16:02.429
Wayne: It was sick.

1:16:02.429,1:16:03.429
Yes!

1:16:03.429,1:16:04.429
Trog: That does sound pretty sick.

1:16:04.429,1:16:05.429
Wayne: Log, what’re yours?

1:16:05.429,1:16:06.600
Log: When I was a kid I had a stuffed bear
named Happy and a

1:16:06.600,1:16:08.170
stuffed Pikachu, and they were my two best
friends.

1:16:08.170,1:16:09.170
Trog: Ah, that’s awesome.

1:16:09.170,1:16:10.170
Wayne, chuckling: Great name.

1:16:10.170,1:16:11.170
Baaulp: Aww.

1:16:11.170,1:16:12.170
Wayne: Great name.

1:16:12.170,1:16:13.280
Trog: I used to have a shit ton of Beanie
Babies as a kid.

1:16:13.280,1:16:14.280
Gir: Same.

1:16:14.280,1:16:15.280
Trog: I don’t even know where I got ‘em
from.

1:16:15.280,1:16:17.200
Gir: I still have all of them, and they’re
in a sack

1:16:17.200,1:16:18.270
somewhere in my closet.

1:16:18.270,1:16:20.980
Log, laughing: You’re shitting on the name
of a stuffed

1:16:20.980,1:16:21.980
bear.

1:16:21.980,1:16:23.680
[Wayne laughs and Trog joins in]

1:16:23.680,1:16:26.739
Log: Yeah, I’m pretty sure that I still
have those guys.

1:16:26.739,1:16:27.960
Well, actually not the Pikachu.

1:16:27.960,1:16:30.630
The Pikachu got mauled by an animal and we
tried—

1:16:30.630,1:16:31.630
Trog: Oh no.

1:16:31.630,1:16:33.540
Log: —we tried to repair it, but it just
wasn’t the same.

1:16:33.540,1:16:34.540
Trog: Aww.

1:16:34.540,1:16:35.949
Wayne: I had a Pikachu that was like a stuffed
animal with

1:16:35.949,1:16:38.941
like, a mechanical bit inside of it and you
would like, squeeze its cheeks and

1:16:38.941,1:16:40.659
it would like, light up and go like, “Pikachu!”

1:16:40.659,1:16:41.659
It was great.

1:16:41.659,1:16:42.900
Gir: It would electrocute you.

1:16:42.900,1:16:45.170
Wayne: Yeah, it had static shock features
[laughs].

1:16:45.170,1:16:47.000
Gir: They could probably get away with that
these days.

1:16:47.000,1:16:48.000
Wayne: Yeah.

1:16:48.000,1:16:50.430
Trog: The other thing that I uh-that I had
as a kid that I

1:16:50.430,1:16:52.010
really liked were Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

1:16:52.010,1:16:53.010
I was big into Yu-Gi-Oh.

1:16:53.010,1:16:54.010
Wayne: Yes.

1:16:54.010,1:16:55.320
Trog: Definitely didn’t know how to play
the game but—

1:16:55.320,1:16:56.320
Baaulp: Same.

1:16:56.320,1:16:57.320
Gir: Same.

1:16:57.320,1:16:58.320
Trog: —damn did those cards look sick.

1:16:58.320,1:16:59.320
Gir: We were all the same that way.

1:16:59.320,1:17:00.320
Baaulp: I had so many Yu-Gi-Oh cards.

1:17:00.320,1:17:02.960
Wayne: This is actually a great topic because
someone has a

1:17:02.960,1:17:07.221
Yu-Gi-Oh related question that like, was a
little bit too specific but we can

1:17:07.221,1:17:08.221
like talk about Yu-Gi-Oh!

1:17:08.221,1:17:09.900
When you were a kid, did you understand the
rules of

1:17:09.900,1:17:10.900
Yu-Gi-Oh?

1:17:10.900,1:17:11.900
Gir: Barely.

1:17:11.900,1:17:13.630
Baaulp: In theory, yes, but not really.

1:17:13.630,1:17:14.630
Trog: Nope!

1:17:14.630,1:17:15.630
Not at all.

1:17:15.630,1:17:16.630
Well like, barely.

1:17:16.630,1:17:18.830
Wayne: When I was a kid no one understood
it, and some of

1:17:18.830,1:17:22.940
the cards were so complicated that I could
just bullshit whatever I wanted.

1:17:22.940,1:17:23.940
Trog: Yep.

1:17:23.940,1:17:26.040
Wayne: There was a card that had a picture
that was like, a

1:17:26.040,1:17:27.040
bunch of scrolls.

1:17:27.040,1:17:31.949
It was like scrolls flying around in an interdimensional
space, and the text was—it had something

1:17:31.949,1:17:36.770
to do with like, adding a card onto
another card, and the block of text was so

1:17:36.770,1:17:40.690
big that you could barely read it,
and it was too complex for me or any of my

1:17:40.690,1:17:43.489
other friends to understand, so
anything I played it I’d be just like, “Yeah,

1:17:43.489,1:17:44.989
I know what that one does.

1:17:44.989,1:17:46.820
I
will-I will put this on my Blue Eyes White

1:17:46.820,1:17:50.750
Dragon and I can add any
monster card to this card, and you just have

1:17:50.750,1:17:53.300
to add up their attacks, and I can
do this however many times I want.”

1:17:53.300,1:17:54.300
[Trog laughs]

1:17:54.300,1:17:55.300
Wayne: And I did that and would win all the
time.

1:17:55.300,1:17:56.300
Trog: Yeah.

1:17:56.300,1:18:01.730
I understood how to win the game because that
part was pretty much the only part of the

1:18:01.730,1:18:03.490
rules that actually like—

1:18:03.490,1:18:05.909
Baaulp: It’s easy, you just have to destroy
the other

1:18:05.909,1:18:06.909
player.

1:18:06.909,1:18:07.909
Trog: Yeah, you just bring the other player’s
life points to

1:18:07.909,1:18:08.909
zero.

1:18:08.909,1:18:10.610
That’s how it works in the show, so that’s
how it works in the game.

1:18:10.610,1:18:13.810
I
totally didn’t understand how trading card

1:18:13.810,1:18:17.389
games worked on any level, and I
would think that it’s like, “Oh I can

1:18:17.389,1:18:21.290
just like, discard any cards I want if I
don’t want them, and then just keep drawing

1:18:21.290,1:18:24.110
cards from my deck, right?”

1:18:24.110,1:18:25.110
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

1:18:25.110,1:18:26.449
Trog: Like, I didn’t understand the concept
of like, “Oh,

1:18:26.449,1:18:31.060
you draw one a turn, you can’t just throw
cards away,” all that stuff was too

1:18:31.060,1:18:32.810
much for my child brain.

1:18:32.810,1:18:35.949
Gir: I mostly just didn’t understand the
concept of uh,

1:18:35.949,1:18:36.949
strategy.

1:18:36.949,1:18:37.949
Trog: Yeah.

1:18:37.949,1:18:38.949
Wayne, laughing: Yeah.

1:18:38.949,1:18:39.949
Trog: That’s definitely…

1:18:39.949,1:18:40.949
yeah.

1:18:40.949,1:18:41.949
Wayne: It was get the big numbers out!

1:18:41.949,1:18:42.949
Gir: Yeah, I would get a card and be like,
“I use this.”

1:18:42.949,1:18:43.949
And
they’re like, “You can’t use that.”

1:18:43.949,1:18:44.949
“Oh, well…

1:18:44.949,1:18:45.949
I don’t know.

1:18:45.949,1:18:46.949
Your turn then.”

1:18:46.949,1:18:47.949
[Wayne and Trog laugh]

1:18:47.949,1:18:48.949
Wayne: Yeah.

1:18:48.949,1:18:49.949
No, one of the things we would do—So in
uh, in

1:18:49.949,1:18:54.540
Magic the Gathering, I mean, as far as I know
from like just osmosis from my

1:18:54.540,1:18:57.180
friends Mira and Baaulp, you-you can draft.

1:18:57.180,1:19:00.442
There’s like a draft kind of like,
playstyle where you—

1:19:00.442,1:19:01.442
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah, you open up packs.

1:19:01.442,1:19:03.460
Wayne: —you draft from like, a pool of cards,
you pick your

1:19:03.460,1:19:04.460
deck.

1:19:04.460,1:19:06.930
What me and my friends would do, I had a lot
of Yu-Gi-Oh cards, and we

1:19:06.930,1:19:10.571
would just put them in a bin, shake them around,
dump them on the floor, and we

1:19:10.571,1:19:13.409
would pretty much do draft but with no limitations.

1:19:13.409,1:19:14.409
[Trog laughs]

1:19:14.409,1:19:16.550
Wayne: So it’d just be like—we’d just
have these giant

1:19:16.550,1:19:20.020
decks of like, anything we wanted, and it
was great.

1:19:20.020,1:19:21.020
Trog: That sounds fun!

1:19:21.020,1:19:22.020
Wayne: Yeah.

1:19:22.020,1:19:23.020
Gir: It’s called no holds drafts.

1:19:23.020,1:19:25.040
Baaulp: It’s expensive to get all the cards
together, but

1:19:25.040,1:19:29.230
there’s a way to play Magic called cube,
where you just get all your favorite

1:19:29.230,1:19:32.570
cards, you like, come up with deck archetypes,
and you just put all of them

1:19:32.570,1:19:36.850
together and you make artificial booster packs
and keep you drafting those and

1:19:36.850,1:19:37.880
playing over and over again.

1:19:37.880,1:19:40.210
It’s probably one of the best ways to play
if it

1:19:40.210,1:19:41.940
wasn’t like, so expensive to put together.

1:19:41.940,1:19:44.770
Trog: Whenever I was a kid I used to play
basketball cards

1:19:44.770,1:19:46.739
as if they were a card game.

1:19:46.739,1:19:47.810
[Everyone laughs]

1:19:47.810,1:19:49.420
Baaulp: Oh damn.

1:19:49.420,1:19:51.560
Wayne: I play Michael Jordan!

1:19:51.560,1:19:52.600
Trog: No, like.

1:19:52.600,1:19:53.640
No joke, literally!

1:19:53.640,1:19:55.020
Gir: In attack mode!

1:19:55.020,1:19:58.920
Trog: Literally, like, I like, because my
dad is a coach

1:19:58.920,1:20:03.880
like, for a—like a middle school coach,
and they would do basketball camps every

1:20:03.880,1:20:07.570
summer, and every summer I would go to them
and get a shit ton of basketball

1:20:07.570,1:20:10.840
cards ‘cause they would just give them out
to all the kids, and so I ended up

1:20:10.840,1:20:13.460
with a fuck ton of basketball cards.

1:20:13.460,1:20:18.201
And, being a kid that loves Yu-Gi-Oh, but
doesn’t have a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh cards, but

1:20:18.201,1:20:22.920
does have ten times as many
basketball cards, it was time for me to make

1:20:22.920,1:20:27.130
my own version of Yu-Gi-Oh where
Michael Jordan was the Blue Eyes White Dragon.

1:20:27.130,1:20:28.130
[Everyone laughs]

1:20:28.130,1:20:29.210
Baaulp: Holy shit.

1:20:29.210,1:20:31.750
Wayne: See, I like the idea that you’d be
playing a game of

1:20:31.750,1:20:34.570
Yu-Gi-Oh with your friends and you just sneak
a Michael Jordan card in your

1:20:34.570,1:20:35.570
deck.

1:20:35.570,1:20:36.570
Trog, laughing: You just throw that one out.

1:20:36.570,1:20:37.570
[Log laughs]

1:20:37.570,1:20:40.130
Log: I specifically didn’t understand the
value in sports

1:20:40.130,1:20:42.040
cards because they didn’t have moves and
effects.

1:20:42.040,1:20:43.040
Trog: Yeah, they didn’t do anything!

1:20:43.040,1:20:44.040
[Baaulp laughs]

1:20:44.040,1:20:45.040
Trog: I was the same way!

1:20:45.040,1:20:47.310
It was like, what makes one of
these more valuable, it doesn’t matter.

1:20:47.310,1:20:50.030
Log: Yeah, I mean, I—there’s no game.

1:20:50.030,1:20:53.282
There’s no—They don’t
have HP, they don’t have attack, what can

1:20:53.282,1:20:54.739
I use them for?

1:20:54.739,1:20:56.920
Wayne: I mean, we were like—we’re-we’re—there’s
a little bit

1:20:56.920,1:21:01.760
of like, age range here, but we were born
before the time of like, the strictly

1:21:01.760,1:21:02.760
collectible—

1:21:02.760,1:21:03.760
Trog and Baaulp: Yeah.

1:21:03.760,1:21:04.760
Wayne: —like, things you can get into.

1:21:04.760,1:21:06.170
Like, like, none of
us had pogs, right?

1:21:06.170,1:21:07.170
Trog and Baaulp: No.

1:21:07.170,1:21:08.170
Gir: Not on purpose.

1:21:08.170,1:21:10.840
Trog: We like, really just missed the boat
on pogs.

1:21:10.840,1:21:12.909
Pogs was like, the generation right before
us.

1:21:12.909,1:21:14.970
Wayne: Pogs sounded pretty great, honestly.

1:21:14.970,1:21:17.420
Trog: And every time I hear someone talk about
them it’s

1:21:17.420,1:21:19.930
like, damn I would’ve fucking loved pogs
as a kid.

1:21:19.930,1:21:20.930
Wayne: Yeah.

1:21:20.930,1:21:21.930
Trog: Sad that I missed out on that.

1:21:21.930,1:21:24.260
Wayne: And I was mistaken, there was a game
to pogs.

1:21:24.260,1:21:25.699
Like,
you had to-you had to slam them on the table,

1:21:25.699,1:21:26.699
and try to take other people’s
pogs.

1:21:26.699,1:21:27.920
Trog: [Crosstalk] Yeah, you like try to flip
them.

1:21:27.920,1:21:28.920
You play
for keeps.

1:21:28.920,1:21:32.170
Baaulp: Pogs is cool from the standpoint that
the game was

1:21:32.170,1:21:33.370
the game.

1:21:33.370,1:21:37.801
And what your pogs were were purely cosmetic,
so like, you could

1:21:37.801,1:21:39.810
really like, let your character shine through,
y’know.

1:21:39.810,1:21:42.380
Trog: Yeah, no, that’s the cool thing about
pogs, is that

1:21:42.380,1:21:46.580
pogs were literally just a piece of cardboard
with something printed on the

1:21:46.580,1:21:47.580
front—

1:21:47.580,1:21:48.580
Baaulp: Yeah, exactly.

1:21:48.580,1:21:49.580
[Wayne laughs]

1:21:49.580,1:21:51.969
Trog: —so like, you could have pogs for
like, any possible

1:21:51.969,1:21:53.301
franchise that you like.

1:21:53.301,1:21:54.301
Wayne: Didn’t they have like a, lamination
on them, or

1:21:54.301,1:21:55.301
something?

1:21:55.301,1:21:56.301
Weren’t they like a [unintelligible] of
sorts?

1:21:56.301,1:21:57.301
Gir: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

1:21:57.301,1:21:58.301
Trog: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

1:21:58.301,1:21:59.301
Gir: [Crosstalk] Like a thin plastic film.

1:21:59.301,1:22:00.301
Trog: Yeah, yeah.

1:22:00.301,1:22:01.301
I mean, they were like—

1:22:01.301,1:22:02.301
Wayne: ‘Cause you could get like a pog maker.

1:22:02.301,1:22:03.301
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:22:03.301,1:22:04.301
Trog: Yeah, I remember them.

1:22:04.301,1:22:05.301
Yeah.

1:22:05.301,1:22:06.301
Gir: I’ve collected Pokémon cards for the
sake of collecting

1:22:06.301,1:22:07.301
the cards.

1:22:07.301,1:22:08.880
Not because I wanted to play that godawful
game.

1:22:08.880,1:22:10.530
Trog: I did Pokémon for a little bit.

1:22:10.530,1:22:13.320
Wayne: You treated Pokémon cards like basketball
cards.

1:22:13.320,1:22:14.320
Trog: Yeah.

1:22:14.320,1:22:16.160
Wayne: I feel like the thing with Pokémon
cards—they fell,

1:22:16.160,1:22:18.010
somehow, into a pit where they were treated
like that.

1:22:18.010,1:22:20.940
I never—I had tons of Pokémon
cards, never played the game, ever.

1:22:20.940,1:22:21.940
Trog: Yeah, I don’t know.

1:22:21.940,1:22:24.380
Gir: Well you collect Pokémon in the Pokémon
games, so I

1:22:24.380,1:22:25.380
mean…

1:22:25.380,1:22:26.380
Trog: That’s fair.

1:22:26.380,1:22:27.380
Wayne: Yeah, but you fight with them.

1:22:27.380,1:22:28.380
Gir: No, I don’t.

1:22:28.380,1:22:29.380
Trog: Yeah, but you can also just collect
them just to have

1:22:29.380,1:22:30.380
them.

1:22:30.380,1:22:31.380
Like, you gotta catch ‘em all.

1:22:31.380,1:22:32.380
That’s what they say.

1:22:32.380,1:22:33.380
Gir: Yeah.

1:22:33.380,1:22:34.380
Wayne: Yeah.

1:22:34.380,1:22:35.380
Gir: I like to look at the pictures.

1:22:35.380,1:22:36.380
It’s not ‘gotta fight
with ‘em all’.

1:22:36.380,1:22:37.380
Wayne: And the art on Pokémon cards is pretty
good.

1:22:37.380,1:22:38.380
I-I
really like the old Pokémon card art.

1:22:38.380,1:22:39.400
Baaulp: I can’t let Log’s idea go.

1:22:39.400,1:22:45.160
I would play the shit
out of a card game where the cards were like,

1:22:45.160,1:22:46.160
fuck it.

1:22:46.160,1:22:50.380
Pick a sport y’know,
basketball, football, just make a card game

1:22:50.380,1:22:57.150
where are the cards are like, pro
players, but don’t have the game replicate

1:22:57.150,1:23:01.250
like, how a normal football,
basketball, hockey game would progress.

1:23:01.250,1:23:04.510
Instead, structure it like a fantasy
battle, like—

1:23:04.510,1:23:05.510
[Trog laughs]

1:23:05.510,1:23:10.050
Baaulp: —Okay, I-I play two uh, Larry Bird—I
play two Magic

1:23:10.050,1:23:16.360
Johnson’s uh, fetch-fetch a-fetch a [laughs]
Michael Jordan number one, special

1:23:16.360,1:23:17.360
summon.

1:23:17.360,1:23:18.940
Wayne: I want a scry to find LeBron James.

1:23:18.940,1:23:19.940
Trog: Yeah.

1:23:19.940,1:23:22.260
It’s kinda ironic, because yeah, as a kid,
a

1:23:22.260,1:23:27.639
basketball card has no intrinsic worth because
it has no statistics tied to it

1:23:27.639,1:23:31.050
that are part of a game, but in reality it’s
the opposite.

1:23:31.050,1:23:34.710
A basketball card is
one hundred percent tied to the worth of the

1:23:34.710,1:23:36.750
literal human it is based off of.

1:23:36.750,1:23:37.750
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:23:37.750,1:23:38.750
Gir: Yeah.

1:23:38.750,1:23:40.170
Trog: And a Yu-Gi-Oh card is whatever Konami
decides to

1:23:40.170,1:23:41.170
print on it.

1:23:41.170,1:23:42.170
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:23:42.170,1:23:43.170
Trog: It’s completely arbitrary.

1:23:43.170,1:23:46.300
Baaulp: Alright, the point of this deck is
to get as many

1:23:46.300,1:23:49.810
Shaqs into your graveyard as you can, and
then bring them back.

1:23:49.810,1:23:50.810
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

1:23:50.810,1:23:53.239
Gir: Kill Shaq as much as you can.

1:23:53.239,1:23:54.239
Wayne: The Shaq zombie deck.

1:23:54.239,1:23:56.620
Baaulp, laughing: It’s a-it’s a basketball
card game but

1:23:56.620,1:23:57.620
there’s a graveyard.

1:23:57.620,1:23:59.770
[Wayne, Trog, and Log laugh]

1:23:59.770,1:24:02.690
Wayne, laughing: The players are dying.

1:24:02.690,1:24:04.550
What happens when
you exile Michael Jordan?

1:24:04.550,1:24:05.550
Trog: He disappears.

1:24:05.550,1:24:06.550
Pops out of existence.

1:24:06.550,1:24:07.550
[Wayne laughs]

1:24:07.550,1:24:10.150
Baaulp: The funny thing is that’s just called
the bench, but

1:24:10.150,1:24:11.650
the graveyard is a graveyard.

1:24:11.650,1:24:12.960
[Wayne and Log laugh]

1:24:12.960,1:24:15.699
Wayne: I use a—I use Hierophant’s Cage
to summon a minotaur

1:24:15.699,1:24:17.699
to hold Michael Jordan on the bench.

1:24:17.699,1:24:19.980
[Trog, Log, and Wayne laugh]

1:24:19.980,1:24:23.860
Trog: KingMusicManz asks, “Who is your best
impersonation?”

1:24:23.860,1:24:26.909
Gir: That’s hard because it’s up to someone
else to tell you

1:24:26.909,1:24:27.909
it’s good.

1:24:27.909,1:24:30.690
If you’re like certain your impersonation’s
good, it’s probably not.

1:24:30.690,1:24:33.409
Wayne: I think the only one that I’ve ever
done that any

1:24:33.409,1:24:37.000
of you have ever told me was even remotely
okay is Agent 47.

1:24:37.000,1:24:39.620
Trog: Your Agent 47 is pretty good, I like
it.

1:24:39.620,1:24:40.960
It’s
definitely entertaining.

1:24:40.960,1:24:42.280
Baaulp: This question is weird.

1:24:42.280,1:24:43.679
Is this supposed to be our
last question?

1:24:43.679,1:24:44.679
Trog and Gir: Yeah.

1:24:44.679,1:24:46.920
Trog: I want to go out on somebody’s amazing
impersonation.

1:24:46.920,1:24:47.920
Baaulp: Oh.

1:24:47.920,1:24:50.780
Wayne: Uh, Log—Ohhh, Log does an amazing
Yajirobe

1:24:50.780,1:24:51.780
impersonation.

1:24:51.780,1:24:52.780
Gir: Does he?

1:24:52.780,1:24:55.590
Log: That makes no sense to me because I don’t
know what

1:24:55.590,1:24:57.150
Yajirobe actually sounds like.

1:24:57.150,1:24:58.790
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

1:24:58.790,1:25:01.739
Baaulp: Log, show me your imp—your amazing
Yajirobe

1:25:01.739,1:25:02.739
impression!

1:25:02.739,1:25:06.580
Log: Uhh… here, let me-let me see if I can
try it.

1:25:06.580,1:25:08.070
Log, as Yajirobe: Hey!

1:25:08.070,1:25:11.900
This is the voice I make
when I try to be Kuwabara, but apparently

1:25:11.900,1:25:12.900
that’s Yajirobe, too!

1:25:12.900,1:25:14.190
Wayne: It’s the same voice!

1:25:14.190,1:25:15.330
Trog: It’s the same voice, yeah.

1:25:15.330,1:25:16.330
Gir: Eh, kinda.

1:25:16.330,1:25:17.330
Wayne, as Agent 47: Hello, Yajirobe.

1:25:17.330,1:25:18.929
Log, as Yajirobe: I’ve never heard Yajirobe
in my life!

1:25:18.929,1:25:22.320
Gir: Look, I’m a Dragon Ball aficionado,
and I gotta say,

1:25:22.320,1:25:23.320
that’s alright.

1:25:23.320,1:25:24.320
Log: Yeah, well..

1:25:24.320,1:25:25.320
Wayne: It’s not bad.

1:25:25.320,1:25:26.320
Gir: You could do better, but you could do
worse.

1:25:26.320,1:25:27.320
Log: I-I wouldn’t know.

1:25:27.320,1:25:30.360
Wayne: Let’s do a fanon scene with Yajirobe
and Agent 47.

1:25:30.360,1:25:31.360
Go.

1:25:31.360,1:25:32.400
Wayne, as Agent 47: Hello, Yajirobe.

1:25:32.400,1:25:33.570
Log, as Yajirobe: Hey!

1:25:33.570,1:25:34.570
You’ve got my suit on!

1:25:34.570,1:25:35.570
Wayne, as Agent 47: Care for a—

1:25:35.570,1:25:36.950
Log, as Yajirobe: Take it off and give it
to me!

1:25:36.950,1:25:38.570
Wayne, as Agent 47: Care for a treat?

1:25:38.570,1:25:39.570
Log, as Yajirobe: ...Yes.

1:25:39.570,1:25:40.570
[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

1:25:40.570,1:25:41.570
Gir, as Yajirobe: I’m ready to eat, man!

1:25:41.570,1:25:42.570
Trog: And scene.

1:25:42.570,1:25:45.480
Wayne, as Agent 47: It’s like a [unintelligible]
treat.

1:25:45.480,1:25:46.700
Gir, as Yajirobe: [Crosstalk] Put food in
my mouth!

1:25:46.700,1:25:49.280
I need
to use the bathroom!

1:25:49.280,1:25:52.160
[Log and Trog laugh]

1:25:52.160,1:25:57.760
Log, as Yajirobe: Hey, what are these scissors
doing on the

1:25:57.760,1:25:58.760
floor?

1:25:58.760,1:25:59.760
Gir, as Yajirobe: Is that a coin?

1:25:59.760,1:26:01.580
Log, as Yajirobe: Guess I-guess I better pick
them up!

1:26:01.580,1:26:03.561
Wayne: I can’t—I mean, if I’m in character
I can’t say

1:26:03.561,1:26:05.949
anything because Agent 47 doesn’t really
talk that often.

1:26:05.949,1:26:08.270
Gir, as Agent 47: Hey, go pick up that coin
off the floor

1:26:08.270,1:26:09.270
for me.

1:26:09.270,1:26:11.780
Trog: Yeah, what if that, what if every time
Agent 47 threw

1:26:11.780,1:26:15.020
a coin he just also said like, “Hey, can
you pick that up for me?”

1:26:15.020,1:26:17.230
Gir, as Agent 47: Could you grab that for
me?

1:26:17.230,1:26:18.690
Trog, as Agent 47: I just dropped this.

1:26:18.690,1:26:20.599
Baaulp, in a British accent: ‘Ello, what’s
this?

1:26:20.599,1:26:22.659
A pair o’
scissors on the ground?

1:26:22.659,1:26:23.940
Gir: Oh, that’s my favorite character!

1:26:23.940,1:26:24.940
Trog: Alright, and who is this?

1:26:24.940,1:26:25.940
What is this new character?

1:26:25.940,1:26:26.940
Is this Gordon Ramsay?

1:26:26.940,1:26:28.550
Wayne: That’s Agent 47’s uh, commissioner.

1:26:28.550,1:26:29.880
Log: That-that’s Ms. Burnwood.

1:26:29.880,1:26:30.880
Trog: Oh, okay.

1:26:30.880,1:26:32.200
Gir: Ah, of course.

1:26:32.200,1:26:33.420
Gir, as Yoda: [Clears throat]

1:26:33.420,1:26:34.619
Wayne: Everyone can do a Yoda impression.

1:26:34.619,1:26:35.619
Gir, as Yoda: Very good.

1:26:35.619,1:26:36.619
Gir: I know.

1:26:36.619,1:26:37.619
Baaulp, in a British accent: And what’s
this green creature

1:26:37.619,1:26:38.619
doing here?

1:26:38.619,1:26:39.619
Gir, as Yoda: [Laughs]

1:26:39.619,1:26:40.619
Wayne, as Agent 47: That is my pet, Yoda.

1:26:40.619,1:26:41.619
Gir, as Yoda: I am—Pet I am not.

1:26:41.619,1:26:43.382
Baaulp, in a British accent: Agent 47 this
is—a, this

1:26:43.382,1:26:44.382
is—This creature is disgusting—

1:26:44.382,1:26:45.920
Gir, as Yoda: Pick me up?

1:26:45.920,1:26:48.060
Baaulp, in a British accent: Dispose of him!

1:26:48.060,1:26:49.060
Gir, as Yoda: Fuck you.

1:26:49.060,1:26:50.060
Wayne, as Agent 47: Okay.

1:26:50.060,1:26:51.060
I will use—I will use the fiber
wire.

1:26:51.060,1:26:52.060
On Yoda.

1:26:52.060,1:26:53.389
Gir, as Yoda: [Makes choking sounds]

1:26:53.389,1:26:56.460
Wayne, as Agent 47: Die, bitch [breaks character
and

1:26:56.460,1:26:57.460
laughs].

1:26:57.460,1:26:58.460
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:26:58.460,1:26:59.869
Gir, as Yoda: No, ah!

1:26:59.869,1:27:00.869
No!

1:27:00.869,1:27:01.869
Oh my god, is that Agent Buddy?

1:27:01.869,1:27:02.869
Gir: Now it’s just Grover!

1:27:02.869,1:27:03.869
Gir, as Grover: Is that Agent Buddy?

1:27:03.869,1:27:04.869
Elmo?

1:27:04.869,1:27:06.510
Baaulp: Grover, meet Yajirobe!

1:27:06.510,1:27:08.889
Gir, as Grover: Hello!

1:27:08.889,1:27:13.239
Wayne, as Agent 47: I-I-I-I kill Grover and
take his

1:27:13.239,1:27:14.239
clothes.

1:27:14.239,1:27:15.239
Trog: [Unintelligible]

1:27:15.239,1:27:20.350
Gir, as Grover: There is an assassin at the
end of this

1:27:20.350,1:27:21.350
book!

1:27:21.350,1:27:23.670
Log, in a southern(?) accent: Alright, Agent
47, I need you to

1:27:23.670,1:27:31.460
uh, [smacks lips] take Yoda and uh, you gotta-you
gotta get rid of the body,

1:27:31.460,1:27:32.460
right?

1:27:32.460,1:27:33.460
[Everyone laughs]

1:27:33.460,1:27:34.460
Gir: Who’s this?

1:27:34.460,1:27:38.650
Log, as ???: You gotta, push him over the
ledge.

1:27:38.650,1:27:41.050
Gir: Oh, is that supposed to be fucking Karl
Pilkington?

1:27:41.050,1:27:42.050
Log: I don’t-I don’t know.

1:27:42.050,1:27:45.340
You don’t tell me—you shouldn’t
have asked this question.

1:27:45.340,1:27:46.340
I can’t [unintelligible].

1:27:46.340,1:27:47.340
[Wayne laughs]

1:27:47.340,1:27:48.340
Trog: Oh!

1:27:48.340,1:27:49.340
Kermit the Frog!

1:27:49.340,1:27:50.340
When did you get here?

1:27:50.340,1:27:51.340
Gir, as Kermit: Oh, I don’t know!

1:27:51.340,1:27:52.340
Wayne, as Agent 47: Agent 47.

1:27:52.340,1:27:54.420
Trog: [Crosstalk] D…does Agent 47 just say
his own name a

1:27:54.420,1:27:55.420
lot?

1:27:55.420,1:27:57.650
Gir, as Kermit: [Crosstalk] Hi-ho, Agent 47.

1:27:57.650,1:27:59.110
Baaulp: He’s like a Pokémon!

1:27:59.110,1:28:00.110
[Trog laughs]

1:28:00.110,1:28:01.110
Gir, as Agent 47: 47.

1:28:01.110,1:28:02.110
47.

1:28:02.110,1:28:03.110
Wayne, as Agent 47: I’m sorry.

1:28:03.110,1:28:04.110
Sorry, sometimes I think out
loud.

1:28:04.110,1:28:05.110
[Laughs]

1:28:05.110,1:28:06.110
[Trog and Gir laugh]

1:28:06.110,1:28:07.310
Gir: That’s perfect for an assassin!

1:28:07.310,1:28:11.210
Baaulp: It would never happen, but an Agent
47 like, map

1:28:11.210,1:28:13.619
that’s just Sesame Street would be so good.

1:28:13.619,1:28:15.840
Wayne: Oh yeah, my favorite game, Agent 47.

1:28:15.840,1:28:16.840
Trog: Yeah.

1:28:16.840,1:28:17.840
Wayne: I think one of them was called that.

1:28:17.840,1:28:20.070
Gir: I was about to say, I’m pretty sure
one was

1:28:20.070,1:28:21.270
called Agent 47.

1:28:21.270,1:28:24.750
Log, in a deep voice: Woah, dude, I just got
the new Hitman!

1:28:24.750,1:28:26.580
Hitman 47!

1:28:26.580,1:28:30.090
Wait a minute, that’s not right!

1:28:30.090,1:28:31.810
How do—Oh no!

1:28:31.810,1:28:34.120
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

1:28:34.120,1:28:37.179
Baaulp: Yoda, what’s the game actually called?

1:28:37.179,1:28:40.690
Gir, as Yoda: Hm, I don’t know.

1:28:40.690,1:28:43.389
Trog: Scatman John, when did you get here!

1:28:43.389,1:28:45.690
Gir, as Scatman John: Scat-a-daba-da-be.

1:28:45.690,1:28:46.690
[Log laughs]

1:28:46.690,1:28:51.670
Baaulp: Oh no, Scatman John, what are you
doing to the

1:28:51.670,1:28:52.670
younglings?

1:28:52.670,1:28:53.670
[Everyone laughs]

1:28:53.670,1:28:57.800
Gir: Alright, I don’t think—we need to
move on from there.

1:28:57.800,1:28:59.740
[Baaulp sings a repetitive tune for several
seconds]

1:28:59.740,1:29:02.080
Trog: Oh, Scatman John you’re here just
in time, Michael

1:29:02.080,1:29:03.270
Jackson just showed up!

1:29:03.270,1:29:05.700
Wayne, as Michael Jackson: Hee-hee!

1:29:05.700,1:29:07.160
[Everyone yells OHHHH!]

1:29:07.160,1:29:11.130
[Baaulp resumes singing the same repetitive
tune]

1:29:11.130,1:29:13.489
Baaulp, in a British accent: Oh, you won’t
best me MJ, I have

1:29:13.489,1:29:14.489
the high ground!

1:29:14.489,1:29:18.070
Gir, as Yoda: You will not win.

1:29:18.070,1:29:19.090
[Log and Trog laugh]

1:29:19.090,1:29:20.090
Gir, as Yoda: Win you will not.

1:29:20.090,1:29:23.060
Log, as MJ: You underestimate my power!

1:29:23.060,1:29:24.570
Gir, as Yoda: You underestimate…

1:29:24.570,1:29:25.570
me!

1:29:25.570,1:29:26.670
Log: So, in short, to answer the question—

1:29:26.670,1:29:29.000
Wayne, as Harry Potter: [Crosstalk] It’s
me, Harry Potter, I

1:29:29.000,1:29:31.290
am a member of the WayneRadioTV podcast!

1:29:31.290,1:29:34.020
[Laughs] I like, I can’t do any
impression for long enough.

1:29:34.020,1:29:36.170
Log: [Crosstalk] —we don’t know how—we
don’t know—we don’t

1:29:36.170,1:29:37.639
know how to be any character.

1:29:37.639,1:29:39.949
We can’t impress upon any character, so…

1:29:39.949,1:29:41.800
Baaulp, in a British accent: Flipendo!

1:29:41.800,1:29:43.210
Wayne: Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:29:43.210,1:29:44.570
Don’t—You’re not giving us enough
credit.

1:29:44.570,1:29:46.080
Your Yajirobe is legitimately good.

1:29:46.080,1:29:47.080
My Agent 47—

1:29:47.080,1:29:48.080
Baaulp: Flipendo!

1:29:48.080,1:29:49.080
Wayne: —and Baaulp’s [laughs] Flipendo!

1:29:49.080,1:29:50.080
Trog: And Baaulp’s anything he says ever.

1:29:50.080,1:29:51.080
Log, laughing: Flipendo!

1:29:51.080,1:29:52.080
Gir: And I got nothin’.

1:29:52.080,1:29:54.889
Wayne: This is a fuckin’ mess.

1:29:54.889,1:29:55.889
Thank you so much—

1:29:55.889,1:29:56.889
Trog, as Mario: [Crosstalk] It’s a me!

1:29:56.889,1:29:57.889
Mario!

1:29:57.889,1:29:58.889
Wayne: Thank you so much—

1:29:58.889,1:29:59.889
Baaulp, in a British accent: [Crosstalk] You
won’t best—Hmm,

1:29:59.889,1:30:00.889
you won’t best me Harry Potter, I have the
high ground!

1:30:00.889,1:30:01.889
Gir, as Mario: Mario!

1:30:01.889,1:30:04.860
Baaulp, in a British accent: Flipendo!

1:30:04.860,1:30:06.600
Wayne: It’s me, Wario!

1:30:06.600,1:30:08.590
Gir: I can do a—oh, no!

1:30:08.590,1:30:09.590
I can do an impersonation!

1:30:09.590,1:30:10.590
Gir, as Donkey Kong taking damage: Ooh.

1:30:10.590,1:30:11.590
Wayne, laughing: He can!

1:30:11.590,1:30:12.590
He actually does a really good one
of those. 

1:30:12.590,1:30:14.690
Wayne: Thank you so much for listening to
Where Do We Begin.

1:30:14.690,1:30:16.980

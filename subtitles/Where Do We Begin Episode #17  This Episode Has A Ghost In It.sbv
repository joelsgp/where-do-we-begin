0:00:00.000,0:00:28.500
Wayne: [Sniffs] What-what’s that smell?  

0:00:33.060,0:00:34.200
How do we find that smell?

0:00:34.200,0:00:37.320
Baaulp: What smell? What 
smell are you talking about?

0:00:37.320,0:00:38.940
Wayne: I don’t know, where do we begin?

0:00:38.940,0:00:40.719
[A moment of silence passes]

0:00:40.719,0:00:46.260
Wayne: [Laughs weakly] The truth of the 
matter is that in order to find a smell,  

0:00:46.260,0:00:51.240
you would sniff until you locate it. Welcome to 
another episode of the Where Do We Begin podcast,  

0:00:51.240,0:00:56.190
uh, this episode, nominated for 
“Worst Intro of the Year,” uh—

0:00:56.190,0:01:02.280
Baaulp, laughing: Smell—“What’s that 
smell?” That’s all we got, oh my god.

0:01:02.280,0:01:03.600
Trog: We could rerecord it.

0:01:03.600,0:01:05.700
Wayne: Hey, I liked it. I’m Wayne.

0:01:05.700,0:01:06.780
Trog: I’m Trog.

0:01:06.780,0:01:07.732
Log: Log.

0:01:07.732,0:01:08.700
Baaulp: I’m Baaulp.

0:01:08.700,0:01:09.720
Gir: And I’m Gir.

0:01:09.720,0:01:15.960
Wayne: And that’s everyone. And we are here 
tonight with discussions. All kinds of things.

0:01:15.960,0:01:17.880
Gir: Oh boy, oh boy, I love discussions.

0:01:17.880,0:01:22.260
Wayne: The date is October 
seventh, 2020, and we are in the 

0:01:22.260,0:01:25.260
month of the pumpkin. The time of the ghost.

0:01:25.260,0:01:26.669
Gir: That’s right, this is—this is—

0:01:26.669,0:01:27.150
Wayne: It’s Halloween month, baby.

0:01:27.150,0:01:28.620
Gir: The month of Halloween.

0:01:28.620,0:01:34.620
Wayne: This is our Halloween episode and we’ve 
got scary smells, deadspace3.com/smell, uh—

0:01:34.620,0:01:40.680
Gir: I find it interesting that as a holiday that 
you celebrate for five hours out of the night,  

0:01:40.680,0:01:45.660
one day out of the year, is celebrated 
pretty much the entire month of October.

0:01:45.660,0:01:46.680
Wayne: So is Christmas!

0:01:46.680,0:01:48.900
Baaulp: Yeah, they want money, people want money.

0:01:48.900,0:01:52.320
Gir: Christmas can be an all-day 
thing, though. You can eat 

0:01:52.320,0:01:54.240
a meal all day, you can open presents all day—

0:01:54.240,0:01:56.562
Wayne: If you’re a really diehard pumpkin fan—

0:01:56.562,0:01:59.083
Trog: You can’t celebrate Halloween all day.

0:01:59.083,0:01:59.633
Gir: [Crosstalk] Halloween—No, Halloween—

0:01:59.633,0:02:01.320
Wayne: Alright, alright, alright. 
So I’m gonna describe you 

0:02:01.320,0:02:05.040
how to celebrate Halloween all day. 
You wake up, you wake your kids up, you 

0:02:05.040,0:02:08.310
scare them. You give them a little 
chainsaw scare to wake them up outta bed.

0:02:08.310,0:02:08.333
[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

0:02:08.333,0:02:11.280
Wayne: Then you feed them a pumpkin—like a  

0:02:11.280,0:02:15.120
pumpkin flavored breakfast, maybe pumpkin 
pancakes, I bet those would be delicious.

0:02:15.120,0:02:16.331
Baaulp: What? Okay, that sounds good though, yeah.

0:02:16.330,0:02:19.319
Wayne: And then you get them-you 
get them in costume, because 

0:02:19.320,0:02:23.100
they’re gonna go to school in costume 
because there’s a costume party at school—

0:02:23.100,0:02:23.684
Gir: Unless it’s Saturday.

0:02:23.684,0:02:26.220
Wayne: And then they come home and 
then they go trick-or-treating. 

0:02:26.220,0:02:31.140
Listen, so, every five out of seven years 
you can celebrate Halloween all day. 

0:02:31.140,0:02:35.820
And even then you can probably make some 
tweaks for-for the morning. If you don’t 

0:02:35.820,0:02:39.840
have kids, then no, you can’t, but 
if you have kids you can do it.

0:02:39.840,0:02:42.780
Gir: No, the spirit of Halloween is once the sun  

0:02:42.780,0:02:43.560
is down,
sorry.

0:02:43.560,0:02:45.390
Wayne: I mean that’s-that’s at its peak—

0:02:45.390,0:02:47.760
Trog: Yeah, you-you just 
can’t be scary in the light.

0:02:47.760,0:02:49.920
Gir: ‘Cause then the rest of 
that’s no different than the 

0:02:49.920,0:02:50.632
rest of the fucking month.

0:02:50.632,0:02:54.180
Baaulp: Halloween to me has never 
been a holiday about sc—about 

0:02:54.180,0:02:56.753
being actually scared. It’s just a holiday 
about eating candy and dressing up.

0:02:56.753,0:03:02.880
Wayne: That’s one element! Fuckin’ scary stuff 
is a core element to Halloween, are you crazy?

0:03:02.880,0:03:06.600
Log: It’s a theme that’s easy 
to get into. The theme of the 

0:03:06.600,0:03:08.700
month is horror, scary stuff!

0:03:08.700,0:03:11.880
Wayne: It is not common practice 
to celebrate Halloween for 

0:03:11.880,0:03:15.480
the entirety of the day like you would 
Christmas, but you could. You absolutely 

0:03:15.480,0:03:18.900
could if you were a diehard Halloween 
fan and I guarantee you there are people 

0:03:18.900,0:03:19.500
who do.

0:03:19.500,0:03:19.980
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:03:19.980,0:03:22.380
Wayne: So, email in wheredowebeginqa,  

0:03:22.380,0:03:24.000
do you celebrate Halloween
all day?

0:03:24.000,0:03:27.360
Baaulp: I know for a fact that 
people do that because people 

0:03:27.360,0:03:33.420
will like—people around here, they’ll 
go to Salem, Massachusetts, they’ll just 

0:03:33.420,0:03:39.240
go and they’ll just like, party. And it’s like, 
they-they like—it like—that’s—it’s—Salem’s 

0:03:40.020,0:03:43.500
a pretty normal place but like, during 
Halloween they turn into a tourist town, 

0:03:43.500,0:03:47.880
where like you go and it’s like, “Oh, 
let’s check out where they burn witches, 

0:03:47.880,0:03:51.180
and then go drinking and eat candy, I guess.”

0:03:51.180,0:03:54.720
Gir: Do you think there’s 
somebody who wakes up Halloween 

0:03:54.720,0:03:58.140
morning and the first thing out of 
their mouth is just like, “Oh, boo! 

0:03:58.140,0:04:02.610
Halloween!” They just realize what 
day it is, “Oh, boo! Scary day!”

0:04:02.610,0:04:05.340
Wayne: I spent a lot of time 
on the Internet, and people 

0:04:05.340,0:04:06.900
love this fuckin’ holiday, man.

0:04:06.900,0:04:11.040
Log: It’s the only time that has 
like a cool theme to it, it’s 

0:04:11.040,0:04:12.401
like, supernatural stuff, 
it’s weird stuff, y’know.

0:04:12.401,0:04:16.590
Wayne: [Crosstalk] It’s, yeah, 
[Wayne sings part of the Goosebumps 

0:04:16.590,0:04:16.602
theme song].

0:04:16.602,0:04:21.480
Log: Like, it’s so broad like, 
you got creatures and also 

0:04:21.480,0:04:27.720
like, magical beings. The occult. 
Things like that, it’s-it’s cool stuff, 

0:04:27.720,0:04:33.120
it’s fantastical stuff. If come November you 
come in here and you’re all like, pilgrimcore, 

0:04:33.120,0:04:38.160
you got your buckle hat, you’ll get 
shoved into a locker ‘cause what  

0:04:38.160,0:04:38.700
good is
that?

0:04:38.700,0:04:42.475
Wayne: Now thanks—Thanksgiving, that’s a 
holiday you do not celebrate all month.

0:04:42.475,0:04:46.140
Log: Yeah, you don’t do any uh,  

0:04:46.740,0:04:49.440
Captain-Captain John
Arbuckle cosplay.

0:04:49.440,0:04:52.500
Gir: Thanksgiving’s a day where 
you completely gorge yourself 

0:04:52.500,0:04:56.040
on that day, anyway. You’re going to overindulge  

0:04:56.040,0:04:58.380
on one day, you don’t need to
spread it through the month.

0:04:58.380,0:05:00.540
Wayne: Can we all agree, 
all members of this podcast, 

0:05:00.540,0:05:02.441
Thanksgiving is one of the worst holidays?

0:05:02.441,0:05:02.455
Baaulp: Uhh—

0:05:02.455,0:05:03.060
Gir: No.

0:05:03.060,0:05:04.920
Trog: Umm, I don’t know.

0:05:04.920,0:05:05.880
Wayne: I think it sucks shit.

0:05:05.880,0:05:07.320
Gir: Saint Patrick’s Day is stupid.

0:05:07.320,0:05:08.700
Trog: I’m pretty neutral.

0:05:08.700,0:05:12.600
Wayne: Out of the major holidays, I think 
Thanksgiving sucks shit. I mean sure,  

0:05:12.600,0:05:15.525
you can eat some food, but 
like, you can do that any day.

0:05:15.525,0:05:16.890
Gir: Well then what are the major holidays?

0:05:16.890,0:05:19.560
Trog: Are we counting Easter as a major holiday?

0:05:19.560,0:05:23.040
Gir: Yeah, ‘cause I would say Easter 
sucks more shit than Thanksgiving.

0:05:23.040,0:05:24.106
Wayne: I don’t know…

0:05:24.106,0:05:27.660
Gir: [Laughs] When’s the last 
time you celebrated Easter? 

0:05:27.660,0:05:28.620
When you were seven?

0:05:28.620,0:05:30.060
Wayne: Hey, I eat eggs on Easter.

0:05:30.060,0:05:31.710
Trog: I think you can chart, like—

0:05:31.710,0:05:33.180
Wayne: And I like eggs more than turkey.

0:05:33.180,0:05:35.340
Trog: It’s like a line graph, 
right? It’s like a line graph 

0:05:35.340,0:05:39.900
where the x-axis is your age, and the 
y-axis is your enjoyment of a holiday. 

0:05:39.900,0:05:45.120
And I feel like Easter starts high, and 
then just asymptotically approaches no 

0:05:45.120,0:05:48.390
enjoyment at all until you just 
stop celebrating it entirely.

0:05:48.390,0:05:52.260
Baaulp: I’m not Christian, I 
have never celebrated Easter in 

0:05:52.260,0:05:58.680
earnest, that’s honestly, again, it’s 
just a day where you have fun and eat a 

0:05:58.680,0:05:59.220
lot of candy.

0:05:59.220,0:06:02.880
Wayne: Now, I don’t always do 
this, but Easter—Even if I don’t 

0:06:02.880,0:06:07.184
celebrate Easter, Easter do be 
having that post-holiday candy sales.

0:06:07.184,0:06:07.195
Trog: Sure.

0:06:07.195,0:06:10.140
Gir: Well, so does like, every other candy-based—

0:06:10.140,0:06:13.140
Wayne: Not Thanksgiving! You can’t 
get discount candy on Thanksgiving!

0:06:13.140,0:06:16.440
Trog: That’s true, there’s 
no Thanksgiving candy, and if 

0:06:16.440,0:06:17.550
there was it’d be gross.

0:06:17.550,0:06:18.930
Gir: You can get discount turkeys!

0:06:18.930,0:06:20.580
Trog: Like, turkey lollipop.

0:06:20.580,0:06:24.300
Wayne: Who the fuck—I do not buy 
discount turkey on Thanksgiving, 

0:06:24.300,0:06:25.650
something about that sounds heinous.

0:06:25.650,0:06:27.840
Gir: You get a discount turkey on Black Friday.

0:06:27.840,0:06:30.420
Wayne: You want this old meat that didn’t make it?

0:06:30.420,0:06:32.100
Gir: No, that’s the thing, 
though, is you get Thanksgiving 

0:06:32.100,0:06:34.560
done and it’s like, “Alright! [Claps 
once] Tomorrow we’re gonna buy everything 

0:06:34.560,0:06:36.780
dirt fucking cheap,” ‘cause 
the next day is Black Friday.

0:06:36.780,0:06:38.400
Log: Buy our dying corn.

0:06:38.400,0:06:40.565
Wayne: Yeah, but Black Friday sucks so much shit.

0:06:40.565,0:06:40.610
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah, Black Friday sucks.

0:06:40.610,0:06:43.680
Wayne: It by-by principle, brings Thanksgiving’s  

0:06:43.680,0:06:44.211
volumes
down.

0:06:44.211,0:06:46.860
Gir: Oh, I can buy electronics for half price, so…

0:06:46.860,0:06:49.740
Wayne: I think-I think also 
what the holiday of Thanksgiving 

0:06:49.740,0:06:51.960
stands for is also bad.

0:06:51.960,0:06:54.960
Gir: What it stands for is thank-being thankful,  

0:06:54.960,0:06:56.993
that doesn’t mean that’s what 
actually happened [laughs].

0:06:56.993,0:07:00.480
Wayne: Yeah, that’s the base 
level symbolism of the holiday.

0:07:00.480,0:07:03.480
Log: I think if you, if you 
trace it back to like, any 

0:07:03.480,0:07:05.520
historical moment it’ll probably be bad.

0:07:05.520,0:07:06.480
Wayne, laughing: Yeah.

0:07:06.480,0:07:09.120
Log: We don’t really know what 
they were getting up to at 

0:07:09.120,0:07:10.546
All Hallows’ Eve or whatever the fuck.

0:07:10.546,0:07:13.200
Baaulp: April Fool’s day was so fucked up.

0:07:13.200,0:07:17.100
Log: Yeah, the original? The first fool?  

0:07:17.100,0:07:19.740
Like, they’ve toned
fools down since then.

0:07:19.740,0:07:22.900
Wayne: The first trick killed 
like, ten people, absolutely.

0:07:22.900,0:07:22.915
[Baaulp laughs]

0:07:22.915,0:07:24.840
Log: Like, a jester’s domesticated,  

0:07:24.840,0:07:26.245
you don’t know what a
fool is like.

0:07:26.245,0:07:26.275
[Baaulp, Wayne, and Gir laugh]

0:07:26.275,0:07:30.000
Gir: A domesticated fool is a jester.

0:07:30.000,0:07:33.720
Wayne: I mean it’s a sh—they 
had jesters domesticated but 

0:07:33.720,0:07:38.040
like, they got wiped out. You don’t see 
jesters anymore, they went extinct. So, 

0:07:38.040,0:07:39.578
domestication couldn’t save them.

0:07:39.578,0:07:39.595
Gir: It’s true.

0:07:39.595,0:07:42.120
Log: I wanna say though, from 
like a pragmatic point of 

0:07:42.120,0:07:47.024
view, Easter is preferable to Thanksgiving 
because it’s always on a Sunday, right?

0:07:47.024,0:07:47.035
Trog: Mhmm.

0:07:47.035,0:07:51.900
Log: Because, so if like a 
standard 9 to 5, five-days-a-week 

0:07:51.900,0:07:55.980
work week, they’ll always give you the Friday 
off instead of the Sunday ‘cause y’know, 

0:07:55.980,0:07:56.633
that doesn’t count.

0:07:56.633,0:07:56.694
Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Oh, yeah, 
you’re right. You’re right.

0:07:56.694,0:07:57.960
Trog: But if that’s the argument,  

0:07:57.960,0:08:00.120
then Thanksgiving is always
on a Thursday, yeah.

0:08:00.120,0:08:01.740
Log: Thanksgiving’s on a Thursday, they don’t give  

0:08:01.740,0:08:02.400
you the Friday
off.

0:08:02.400,0:08:02.802
Trog: Really? I’ve—

0:08:02.802,0:08:02.815
Baaulp: What?

0:08:02.815,0:08:07.140
Log: You-You—You go to work, 
you have a Thanksgiving Day 

0:08:07.140,0:08:09.180
off, and then you have to go 
back to work for that Friday.

0:08:09.180,0:08:11.340
Wayne: Yeah, I’ve never worked 
a job where they gave me the 

0:08:11.340,0:08:14.460
Friday off. I haven’t had a 
Thanksgiving Friday off since school.

0:08:14.460,0:08:15.960
Log: It’s a waste.

0:08:15.960,0:08:18.540
Wayne: They haven’t done that 
since I was in fuckin’ high 

0:08:18.540,0:08:21.060
school. Every job I’ve worked, 
Thursday, you do not get Friday.

0:08:21.060,0:08:22.230
Trog: I guess it depends.

0:08:22.230,0:08:24.515
Log: You got Thanksgiving 
Thursday, wasteful Friday—

0:08:24.515,0:08:24.534
Wayne: Dark Friday.

0:08:24.534,0:08:27.540
Trog: It depends on if you’re 
working in a retail position 

0:08:27.540,0:08:30.775
or not, ‘cause I haven’t worked 
retail so like, I would always get—

0:08:30.775,0:08:33.420
Gir: Retail you don’t get 
anything off, are you kidding?

0:08:33.420,0:08:35.340
Trog: I would always get Thursday-Friday off.

0:08:35.340,0:08:37.740
Log: I don’t work retail 
and I don’t get Friday off.

0:08:37.740,0:08:41.880
Baaulp: You’re getting screwed 
there, ‘cause I’ve—Ever since—Every 

0:08:41.880,0:08:46.380
non-retail job I’ve had yeah, you get 
the Friday after Thanksgiving off.

0:08:46.380,0:08:47.700
Trog: It’s just a long weekend.

0:08:47.700,0:08:50.280
Wayne: Well, I’ve only ever 
worked jobs that were retail or 

0:08:50.280,0:08:51.900
retail-adjacent, so.

0:08:51.900,0:08:55.320
Gir: I’ve only had one job 
besides streaming, literally only 

0:08:55.320,0:08:59.580
the—Well, I’ve had multiple positions in 
the same company, but it was always—I’ve 

0:08:59.580,0:09:01.260
only worked for one company in my life.

0:09:01.260,0:09:04.200
Wayne: Yeah, meatman, fruitman, 
moneyman, you did it all.

0:09:04.200,0:09:04.620
Gir: Yeah—

0:09:04.620,0:09:05.520
Wayne: Master of grocers.

0:09:05.520,0:09:08.880
Gir: I liked the-I liked the-I 
liked the produce thing, I didn’t 

0:09:08.880,0:09:10.140
like the retail bit.

0:09:10.140,0:09:14.160
Wayne: Yeah, moneyman is the 
worst role to play. Nobody 

0:09:14.160,0:09:14.760
likes to be the moneyman.

0:09:14.760,0:09:17.580
Gir: I didn’t like how I 
had to work every holiday.

0:09:17.580,0:09:19.080
Wayne: Yeah, that sucks shit.

0:09:19.080,0:09:19.860
Gir: Like, mandatory.

0:09:19.860,0:09:20.940
Wayne: That sucks a fatty.

0:09:20.940,0:09:23.520
Gir: I will say though, I 
got lucky, I only had to work 

0:09:23.520,0:09:27.840
Christmas one year, but holy shit, what 
a fuckin’ miserable experience working 

0:09:27.840,0:09:28.560
Christmas day.

0:09:28.560,0:09:31.620
Wayne: Working at the pet store, 
uh, my days off were always 

0:09:31.620,0:09:36.600
Thursday and Friday, that had two 
downsides. One, anytime a holiday 

0:09:36.600,0:09:40.380
would fall on a Thursday, I wouldn’t 
get an extra day off, which was always 

0:09:40.380,0:09:45.180
upsetting, uh, like a—Basically, 
Thanksgiving always sucked because it was 

0:09:45.180,0:09:48.000
like, “Okay, here’s a day that 
you would normally have like,  

0:09:48.000,0:09:49.363
to do whatever the
fuck you want,”—

0:09:49.363,0:09:49.373
Gir: Mhmm.

0:09:49.373,0:09:55.560
Wayne: “But no, like, everyone else is getting 
off work and you have to be fully occupied going  

0:09:55.560,0:09:59.520
out somewhere or whatever. You have to celebrate 
Thanksgiving. And then the other downs—But-but  

0:09:59.520,0:10:04.860
the pros, the upside to that was I never worked 
a single Black Friday because I always had Friday  

0:10:04.860,0:10:10.440
off. They never-they never got me. They tried, 
I think there was one year—I think there was  

0:10:10.440,0:10:13.260
one year where they tried to pull me in, and I was 
like, “Nah, it’s my day off and I’m gonna be outta  

0:10:13.260,0:10:17.995
town for Thanksgiving,” which was a lie, I never 
fucking leave town for Thanksgiving [laughs].

0:10:17.995,0:10:20.850
Gir: I lied—I lied through 
my fuckin’ teeth at work.

0:10:20.850,0:10:22.904
Baaulp: You were just hiding in a cave instead.

0:10:22.904,0:10:25.320
Wayne: [Laughs] Yeah, I had to hide in a cave or  

0:10:25.320,0:10:25.980
else they’d
find me.

0:10:25.980,0:10:30.360
Gir: That completely reminded me, uh, I 
remember when I got so fed up with like,  

0:10:30.360,0:10:34.440
after that Christmas that I worked, I got 
so fed up with that shit that come January,  

0:10:34.440,0:10:37.500
I was like, “Okay, this year I’m 
setting a fucking—I’m setting two  

0:10:37.500,0:10:41.520
days that I will not work,” because you 
can set that as a schedule restriction,  

0:10:42.360,0:10:46.800
and uh, I was like, “Alright, let me look 
at the calendar for the end of this year,  

0:10:46.800,0:10:54.300
when does Christmas happen this year, and like, 
Oh, Christmas Eve is like Tuesday, Christmas day  

0:10:54.300,0:10:59.040
is like, Wednesday. Alright, I’m never working 
Tuesdays or Wednesdays, don’t even call me on  

0:10:59.040,0:11:04.380
Tuesdays or Wednesdays.” And that worked out 
so fucking well [laughs] ‘cause it guaranteed  

0:11:04.380,0:11:08.460
one year I wouldn’t have to work Christmas day, 
the next year I wouldn’t have to work Christmas  

0:11:08.460,0:11:11.932
day. And then this year I would’ve had to but 
then I said, “Fuck you,” and left [laughs].

0:11:11.932,0:11:13.560
Baaulp: Nice. Calculated.

0:11:13.560,0:11:14.430
Gir: Calculated.

0:11:14.430,0:11:18.900
Trog: We kind of gone off from 
the Halloween discussion, but 

0:11:18.900,0:11:23.700
I’d like to reign us back in towards the 
spooky month of the year, is that okay 

0:11:23.700,0:11:26.592
with everybody? Are you too 
scared to continue discussing it?

0:11:26.592,0:11:26.600
Gir: No.

0:11:26.600,0:11:26.613
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:11:26.613,0:11:26.621
Gir: No.

0:11:26.621,0:11:26.634
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:11:26.634,0:11:30.540
Trog: ‘Cause I was thinking uh, 
I was thinking earlier today 

0:11:30.540,0:11:35.280
actually, about like, do you guys remember 
what you dressed up as for Halloween 

0:11:35.280,0:11:36.000
as a kid?

0:11:36.000,0:11:39.360
Wayne: Yes, I do! I remember every single one.

0:11:39.360,0:11:42.600
Baaulp: I’m gonna be so real, 
I have never dressed up for 

0:11:42.600,0:11:43.782
Halloween, every.

0:11:43.782,0:11:43.794
Wayne: What?

0:11:43.794,0:11:44.760
Trog: How did you get candy?

0:11:44.760,0:11:45.300
Wayne: Wow.

0:11:45.300,0:11:47.263
Baaulp: I didn’t. I didn’t go trick-or-treating.

0:11:47.263,0:11:47.272
Trog: Oh.

0:11:47.272,0:11:52.200
Baaulp: I never went trick-or-treating. 
So, it’s a combination of me asking for  

0:11:52.200,0:11:55.500
a costume to go trick-or-treating 
and my parents saying, “You’re not  

0:11:55.500,0:12:00.900
going to go to people’s—stranger’s houses to 
get candy, and we can’t afford a costume, so…”

0:12:00.900,0:12:04.260
Trog: Okay, well Baaulp, Baaulp, 
what I want you to do Baaulp,  

0:12:04.260,0:12:07.080
is I want you to come up with what you would have—

0:12:07.080,0:12:07.782
Baaulp: Power Ranger.

0:12:07.782,0:12:07.794
[Gir laughs]

0:12:07.794,0:12:10.733
Trog: —gone as as a kid, 
while everybody else I want—

0:12:10.733,0:12:10.794
[Wayne sings a bit of the Mighty 
Morphin Power Rangers theme]

0:12:10.794,0:12:14.880
Trog: I want to hear from 
everybody else what your favorite 

0:12:14.880,0:12:18.480
childhood Halloween costume was. I’m interested.

0:12:18.480,0:12:21.660
Wayne: Uh, favorite how so? 
Favorite looking back as an 

0:12:21.660,0:12:25.260
adult and laughing at it, favorite? Or 
favorite like that was the one I enjoyed 

0:12:25.260,0:12:26.089
the most as a kid?

0:12:26.089,0:12:28.193
Trog: Hmm, I mean feel free to give both.

0:12:28.193,0:12:33.600
Wayne: Both? I somehow remember 
every single costume. Like, 

0:12:33.600,0:12:38.460
I—For whatever reason, I—Halloween at 
the trick-or-treating age was much more 

0:12:38.460,0:12:42.360
special than any other holiday, I 
think. And the memories stand stronger 

0:12:42.360,0:12:47.100
because you had like—There’s so much 
variation in Halloween. Both with like what 

0:12:47.100,0:12:50.640
costume you wear and what you did. Like, 
the people that you go trick-or-treating 

0:12:50.640,0:12:53.280
with, like whoever you’re hanging out 
with and where you go and what you 

0:12:53.280,0:12:56.640
actually partake in on that Halloween 
night. Like Christmas never fucking 

0:12:56.640,0:13:00.300
changes other than like, what you get. 
Thanksgiving never changes other than 

0:13:00.300,0:13:03.540
like, did you eat marshmallow 
casserole or black bean casserole?

0:13:03.540,0:13:03.828
Gir: Ew!

0:13:03.828,0:13:06.540
Wayne: Um, that’s not a dish. 
Black bean casserole isn’t 

0:13:06.540,0:13:11.820
real. Unless it is and you can fucking 
email me your anger, you have that way 

0:13:11.820,0:13:16.380
to do that. Uh, so favorite Halloween 
costume when I was a kid that I enjoyed 

0:13:16.380,0:13:20.803
the most? Did you-did any of you guys 
ever see or dress up as a wraith?

0:13:20.803,0:13:20.813
Gir: Yeah.

0:13:20.813,0:13:24.840
Wayne: Like, like a black—It was 
like a black robe with a hood 

0:13:24.840,0:13:28.920
that had—It was like a cloak with a hood 
that had like a mesh mask over it so 

0:13:28.920,0:13:31.403
that you could see through 
it but no one could see in?

0:13:31.403,0:13:31.414
Trog: Yeah.

0:13:31.414,0:13:31.424
Gir: Yeah.

0:13:31.424,0:13:31.435
Trog: Yeah.

0:13:31.435,0:13:33.600
Gir: That’s literally the only one I had-I could  

0:13:33.600,0:13:34.663
remember, is
that one.

0:13:34.663,0:13:34.673
Trog: Yep.

0:13:34.673,0:13:37.320
Wayne: And like, so you couldn’t 
see into it but it had these 

0:13:37.320,0:13:39.900
like, weird glasses you could wear 
that had like, glowing red eyes.

0:13:39.900,0:13:41.340
Gir: Oh, I didn’t have glowing eyes.

0:13:41.340,0:13:45.480
Wayne: Yeah, it was dope! 
The-the actual like apparatus was 

0:13:45.480,0:13:50.040
strange. But my favorite as an adult, 
because it was fucking funny, I think 

0:13:50.040,0:13:56.400
from the ages of like, three to six, I 
think three years in a row or something 

0:13:56.400,0:13:57.900
like that, I went as Bibleman?

0:13:57.900,0:13:58.260
[Gir laughs]

0:13:58.260,0:13:59.400
Trog: Hell yeah.

0:13:59.400,0:14:04.200
Wayne: I’ve told you guys about 
this, Bibleman is a straight-to-VHS 

0:14:04.800,0:14:12.480
action hero uh, he is a yellow and 
purple cop man with like a yellow light 

0:14:12.480,0:14:17.820
saber that he doesn’t use because he 
wins by convincing the villains to read 

0:14:17.820,0:14:22.260
the Bible or some shit, he like never 
uses the light saber, and when I was a 

0:14:22.260,0:14:25.740
kid I thought he was so fuckin’ cool. And 
now and days I think that’s probably just 

0:14:25.740,0:14:29.190
because of the color scheme, I was a 
child that was attracted to bright colors—

0:14:29.190,0:14:29.213
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:14:29.213,0:14:35.400
Wayne: —and I was brainwashed into Christianity, 
so like bright colors and brainwashing, y’know,  

0:14:35.400,0:14:38.940
I had to love Bibleman, you had to. And then like,  

0:14:39.540,0:14:43.440
when I was a little kid it was Buzz Lightyear 
and Bibleman, those were my two favorite things.

0:14:43.440,0:14:44.316
Gir: Hell yeah, Buzz Lightyear.

0:14:44.316,0:14:44.880
Wayne: [Unintelligible] Buzz Lightyear a bunch and  

0:14:44.880,0:14:46.620
Bibleman those
were my-those were my favorite.

0:14:46.620,0:14:49.860
Gir: Literally all-the only 
one I can remember—For some 

0:14:49.860,0:14:53.700
reason I don’t remember like any of my 
costumes except for like that wraith one 

0:14:53.700,0:14:58.440
that you were describing, uh, I didn’t 
have light up eyes, but I do remember it 

0:14:58.440,0:15:03.180
being one of the more comfortable costumes 
I’d ever worn and it was still incredibly 

0:15:03.180,0:15:06.420
uncomfortable [laughs]. I don’t think 
I once went trick-or-treating in a 

0:15:06.420,0:15:09.840
costume that didn’t make me feel 
uncomfortable after like fifteen minutes.

0:15:09.840,0:15:12.960
Wayne: Yeah, I have a lot of 
discomfort Halloween memories, 

0:15:12.960,0:15:16.680
like I dressed up as a werewolf one year 
and the costume was so fucking hot I 

0:15:16.680,0:15:19.980
was gonna die, and I was like, that 
combined with all the walking around, I was 

0:15:19.980,0:15:21.540
an out of shape child, it was horrible.

0:15:21.540,0:15:27.480
Trog: My picks are um, 
whenever I—I legitimately don’t 

0:15:27.480,0:15:31.860
remember how old I was, I had to have been 
elementary school age for both of these, 

0:15:31.860,0:15:36.702
but one was I went as Sonic the Hedgehog 
and my mom made the costume for me—

0:15:36.702,0:15:36.714
Wayne: Sick.

0:15:36.714,0:15:42.660
Trog: She like-she like made 
these like, felt spine things 

0:15:42.660,0:15:44.700
to put on a hood, that was cool.  

0:15:45.780,0:15:49.560
Um, the weird one, and the one that made me
think of this question in the first place,  

0:15:49.560,0:15:56.160
is I had like a brain memory return
to me of like, being a kid and deciding that  

0:15:56.700,0:16:01.740
I wanted to—This is super fucking
obscure, I wanted to, as a kid,  

0:16:01.740,0:16:07.770
for Halloween, be Quailman. Do any of you know
what that is off the top of your head?

0:16:07.770,0:16:09.720
Wayne: Yeah, I know Quailman! From fucking Doug!

0:16:09.720,0:16:11.340
Baaulp: From Doug?

0:16:11.340,0:16:11.917
Trog: Yeah.

0:16:11.917,0:16:11.930
Baaulp: What?

0:16:11.930,0:16:13.680
Wayne: We had a high school 
teacher that every Halloween 

0:16:13.680,0:16:16.770
would dress a Quailman and he would 
rollerblade into every classroom.

0:16:16.770,0:16:18.180
Gir: I don’t know what that is.

0:16:18.180,0:16:21.960
Trog: Okay, so there was a TV 
show called Doug, let’s see-let’s 

0:16:21.960,0:16:23.616
start there. Well, actually, let’s start—

0:16:23.616,0:16:23.634
Gir: I hated Doug.

0:16:23.634,0:16:26.190
Trog: So, there’s a TV network called Nickelodeon—

0:16:26.190,0:16:27.780
Wayne: Let’s tell him about Doug.  

0:16:28.680,0:16:30.596
So, Doug is this little bald
bitch—

0:16:30.596,0:16:30.614
Gir: I hated Doug.

0:16:30.614,0:16:30.640
Baaulp: So, Viacom is a—

0:16:30.640,0:16:30.654
[Wayne laughs]

0:16:30.654,0:16:34.500
Trog: So, television—

0:16:34.500,0:16:36.060
Log: So, Doug can go faster—

0:16:36.060,0:16:37.728
Wayne: What was wrong with Doug? Hold on—

0:16:37.728,0:16:41.255
Trog: So, a cathode-ray tube 
television is a big vacuum—

0:16:41.255,0:16:41.272
Gir: Doug sucked!

0:16:41.272,0:16:43.740
Baaulp: An electron is a particle that—

0:16:43.740,0:16:45.510
Trog: So, quantum foam—

0:16:45.510,0:16:47.820
Wayne: Gir, why’d you—Gir, 
tell me why you hated Doug.

0:16:47.820,0:16:49.800
Gir: You wanted me-you want me 
to tell you why I hated Doug? 

0:16:49.800,0:16:50.460
He wasn’t funny.

0:16:50.460,0:16:51.360
Wayne: What?

0:16:51.360,0:16:52.373
Trog: He was literally funny.

0:16:52.373,0:16:54.000
Wayne: But he broke grill, he sorry.

0:16:54.000,0:16:56.200
Gir: That video’s funny.

0:16:56.200,0:16:56.214
[Wayne laughs]

0:16:56.214,0:16:59.580
Trog: I just remembered I wanted 
to be Quailman and thinking 

0:16:59.580,0:17:02.580
about that now it’s like—Oh, by the way, 
if you don’t know what the fuck we’re 

0:17:02.580,0:17:06.683
talking about, there’s literally a TV 
show called Doug that was on Nickelodeon—

0:17:06.683,0:17:06.714
Wayne: About a little bald kid.

0:17:06.714,0:17:10.080
Trog: —and Doug had an alter-ego 
superhero called Quailman 

0:17:10.080,0:17:14.366
which was just him wearing 
a-like a green, sleeveless vest—

0:17:14.366,0:17:14.394
Wayne: Which he always wore.

0:17:14.394,0:17:18.960
Trog: —with like a cape with a 
Q on it, and there was a belt, 

0:17:18.960,0:17:25.080
there was a belt wrapped around his 
forehead and wore underpants on top of his 

0:17:25.080,0:17:30.300
regular pants. So that was Quailman, 
so imagine like a five year-old  

0:17:30.300,0:17:31.546
dressed up
like that.

0:17:31.546,0:17:33.960
Gir: [Laughs] I would laugh my ass off.

0:17:33.960,0:17:36.900
Log: It’s so weird to me that 
you liked Doug at that age. 

0:17:36.900,0:17:41.040
That was like, the type of 
cartoon that I filed into,  

0:17:41.040,0:17:42.900
“Only good whenever you’re
an adult.”

0:17:42.900,0:17:45.030
Trog: I-I liked Doug, Doug was good.

0:17:45.030,0:17:47.700
Log: That’s how I categorize it, 
like that was-that was the cartoon 

0:17:47.700,0:17:50.865
that I watched whenever I had chickenpox 
and I was just in bed for a week.

0:17:50.865,0:17:52.980
Trog: [Laughs] Well you’re a 
little younger than me, so I 

0:17:52.980,0:17:55.200
don’t know, maybe you missed the Doug boat.

0:17:55.200,0:18:01.200
Baaulp: I’m inclined to agree with Log, 
and I disagree with Gir, because like,  

0:18:01.200,0:18:07.440
as a—you’re right, Log, as a child 
I don’t think I—I knew of Doug and I  

0:18:07.440,0:18:11.820
watched a few episodes and I didn’t think it 
was that funny, now as an adult I think the  

0:18:11.820,0:18:18.960
concept of someone having a crush on a girl 
named Patti Mayonnaise is incredibly funny.

0:18:18.960,0:18:21.600
Wayne: Gir, I shat on you for 
saying Doug sucked but I also 

0:18:21.600,0:18:23.340
didn’t like Doug when I was 
a kid, so I don’t even know  

0:18:23.340,0:18:23.989
what I was talking
about [laughs].

0:18:23.989,0:18:26.460
Gir: Yeah. I remember specifically—

0:18:26.460,0:18:29.437
Wayne: Doug had a vibe that 
was specifically anti-child.

0:18:29.437,0:18:29.453
Gir: Yeah. Yeah.

0:18:29.453,0:18:31.488
Wayne: I think it like, repels children.

0:18:31.488,0:18:32.670
Baaulp: No, it was anti-Doug.

0:18:32.670,0:18:32.700
Trog: It was [unintelligible].

0:18:32.700,0:18:32.750
Gir, laughing hard: Doug—it was anti-Doug? What?

0:18:32.750,0:18:32.764
[Wayne laughs]

0:18:32.764,0:18:39.781
Log: Doug was in high school, wasn’t he?

0:18:39.780,0:18:40.380
Trog: Nuh-uh.

0:18:40.380,0:18:42.180
Log: That was like a cartoon that took pl—was  

0:18:42.180,0:18:42.720
it middle
school?

0:18:42.720,0:18:44.400
Trog: It was middle school.

0:18:44.400,0:18:46.620
Wayne: I think if you were a 
middle schooler when it aired 

0:18:46.620,0:18:50.074
you probably could appreciate it more, 
I was like. Young. When it aired.

0:18:50.074,0:18:50.094
Gir: I was like ten.

0:18:50.094,0:18:53.640
Trog: Yeah, I mean, like, like 
I said, I mean me, Gir, and 

0:18:53.640,0:18:57.120
Baaulp are the same age but Wayne and 
Log are both younger than the three of 

0:18:57.120,0:18:59.671
us, so I think maybe you guys—

0:18:59.671,0:18:59.681
Gir: Mhmm.

0:18:59.681,0:18:59.694
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:18:59.694,0:19:03.780
Trog: Because to be fair, 
Doug got really bad, it was a 

0:19:03.780,0:19:08.340
Nickelodeon show—I almost said it was a 
Nintendo show, my brain is not working—

0:19:08.340,0:19:08.780
[Gir laughs]

0:19:08.780,0:19:11.280
Trog: Um, it was a Nickelodeon 
show but then they sold it 

0:19:11.280,0:19:14.100
off to Disney, and uh, they made it bad.

0:19:14.100,0:19:18.720
Baaulp: Yeah, Disney just fucking 
ruined it. ‘Cause it was a 

0:19:18.720,0:19:24.000
very like Hey Arnold!-esque show where 
it’s like, Doug was an underdog, he’s 

0:19:24.000,0:19:26.760
not cool, he’s specifically not cool, right?

0:19:26.760,0:19:28.200
Wayne: But he can go faster.

0:19:28.200,0:19:28.785
[Baaulp laughs]

0:19:28.785,0:19:30.900
Gir: He can Doug or he can faster.

0:19:30.900,0:19:34.440
Baaulp: It’s through that that 
it’s endearing, and I-I just 

0:19:34.440,0:19:38.481
like the names as an adult ‘cause 
Doug has a friend named Skeeter—

0:19:38.481,0:19:38.506
Gir: [Crosstalk] Skeeter.

0:19:38.506,0:19:39.000
Trog and Gir: Yeah.

0:19:39.000,0:19:42.480
Baaulp: And he’s-and he has 
a crush on a girl whose last 

0:19:42.480,0:19:43.560
name is Mayonnaise.

0:19:43.560,0:19:46.920
Trog: Yeah, it’s kind of a 
weird—like thinking about it, it 

0:19:46.920,0:19:48.720
kind of makes sense that I 
like it, thinking about what  

0:19:48.720,0:19:50.861
I like now, ‘cause it’s
kind of a bizarre show—

0:19:50.861,0:19:50.874
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:19:50.874,0:19:55.020
Trog: —where it’s just a cartoon 
and like a good amount of 

0:19:55.020,0:20:01.020
the time of an episode is always 
dedicated to Doug having these anxiety 

0:20:01.020,0:20:02.251
daydreams.

0:20:02.251,0:20:02.274
Baaulp: A panic attack.

0:20:02.274,0:20:05.400
Trog: Yeah, like these panic 
attack, anxiety daydreams where 

0:20:05.400,0:20:10.680
he just thinks of the worst possible outcome 
to his current situation. Like that-that 

0:20:10.680,0:20:16.380
was like the thing, like Doug is just 
this like little nerdy like, anxious kid 

0:20:16.380,0:20:18.929
and it’s like, “Wow, I can relate to this.”

0:20:18.929,0:20:18.952
Gir: [Crosstalk] Bitch.

0:20:18.952,0:20:22.200
Baaulp: Yeah, it’s a very 
endearing-it’s a very endearing 

0:20:22.200,0:20:27.120
show, that’s why I sort of have a soft spot 
for it from the few episodes I watched, 

0:20:27.120,0:20:27.720
I got it.

0:20:27.720,0:20:30.000
Wayne: Hey, what the fuck was 
up with that blue kid that 

0:20:30.000,0:20:30.561
honked at him.

0:20:30.561,0:20:30.592
Trog and Gir: That was Skeeter.

0:20:30.592,0:20:32.220
Baaulp: Yeah, that was Skeeter.

0:20:32.220,0:20:34.350
Wayne: They really named their son Skeeter?

0:20:34.350,0:20:34.790
Baaulp: Yeah, and he honks.

0:20:34.790,0:20:36.480
Trog: No, it was a nickname.

0:20:36.480,0:20:39.600
Gir: Now I do have to get us 
back on topic ‘cause Log never 

0:20:39.600,0:20:41.610
told us what his costume was that he liked.

0:20:41.610,0:20:43.560
Trog: Yes, I was just about to say, Log,  

0:20:43.560,0:20:45.360
do you have costume
stories.

0:20:45.360,0:20:48.180
Wayne: Hold on, hold on. 
What was Skeeter’s full name?

0:20:48.180,0:20:50.191
Trog: I don’t know, look it up.

0:20:50.191,0:20:50.214
Baaulp: I don’t know.

0:20:50.214,0:20:51.399
Trog: You have Google.

0:20:51.399,0:20:52.680
Wayne: Well you’ve failed-you failed the Doug  

0:20:52.680,0:20:53.980
test. Alright
Log, go ahead.

0:20:53.980,0:20:53.992
[Gir laughs]

0:20:53.992,0:20:54.960
Baaulp: Doug always called  

0:20:54.960,0:20:59.504
him Skeeter, which was-which in hindsight
is very funny [laughs].

0:20:59.504,0:21:01.140
Wayne: [Laughs] Hey Cummer.

0:21:01.140,0:21:03.480
Log: [Laughs] Skeeter Bust.

0:21:03.480,0:21:05.335
Wayne, laughing: Skeeter Bust!

0:21:05.335,0:21:06.630
Gir: It was Skeeter Valentine!

0:21:06.630,0:21:08.640
Trog: Oh yeah, Valentine.

0:21:08.640,0:21:09.720
Wayne: Buster Skeeter.

0:21:09.720,0:21:11.040
Log: Well anyways,  

0:21:11.040,0:21:14.809
I only remember three costumes. I was
Winnie-the-Pooh whenever I was two—

0:21:14.809,0:21:14.820
Wayne: Aww.

0:21:14.820,0:21:16.920
Trog: Wow, surprised you can remember that.

0:21:16.920,0:21:19.920
Log: I was Harry Potter 
whenever I was five, and I was a 

0:21:19.920,0:21:21.180
Dementor whenever I was eight.

0:21:21.180,0:21:22.140
Trog: Oh, nice.

0:21:22.140,0:21:22.590
Wayne: Yooo.

0:21:22.590,0:21:24.000
Log: Those are the only costumes I remember.

0:21:24.000,0:21:24.653
Trog: You [unintelligible]

0:21:24.653,0:21:26.460
Wayne: What was that Dementor costume like?

0:21:26.460,0:21:28.740
Log: It was pretty much that-what 
you described, the wraith, 

0:21:28.740,0:21:33.120
but instead of like, a mesh mask it was just 
a real ass mask that just kind of looked 

0:21:33.120,0:21:36.463
like a whirlpool ‘cause they 
didn’t have a face, right?

0:21:36.463,0:21:36.475
Wayne: Yeah.

0:21:36.475,0:21:38.940
Log: They didn’t have red eyes 
or anything like that, so I 

0:21:38.940,0:21:45.480
just wore like, some shitty plastic 
to obscure my view. But um, I really 

0:21:45.480,0:21:51.180
remember that-that Harry Potter time 
whenever I was five, because naturally we 

0:21:51.180,0:21:53.760
all know Harry Potter’s just 
fucked beyond belief now—

0:21:53.760,0:21:54.060
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:21:54.060,0:21:54.240
Trog: Yeah.

0:21:54.240,0:21:56.700
Log: But back then whenever 
the first Harry Potter movie 

0:21:56.700,0:22:02.760
came out, there was so much novel candy 
all over the place, like-they had that 

0:22:02.760,0:22:05.633
one scene with the trolley cart 
and just every piece of candy was—

0:22:05.633,0:22:06.780
Wayne: They had the chocolate frogs.

0:22:06.780,0:22:09.420
Log: Every piece of candy 
that was described became real 

0:22:09.420,0:22:10.128
that Halloween.

0:22:10.128,0:22:10.963
Trog: Yeah, that is true.

0:22:10.963,0:22:10.975
Wayne: Mhmm.

0:22:10.975,0:22:12.452
Gir: Yeah, I remember that.

0:22:12.452,0:22:15.360
Log: I ate chocolate frogs, 
those fucked up jellybeans were 

0:22:15.360,0:22:16.170
just widely available, I remember I ate—

0:22:16.170,0:22:16.184
[Wayne laughs]

0:22:16.184,0:22:17.820
Gir: Fuck those jellybeans.

0:22:17.820,0:22:20.100
Wayne: I mean, those are still 
available, but they’re just 

0:22:20.100,0:22:22.290
under a different name now, they 
stopped the Harry Potter branding.

0:22:22.290,0:22:25.300
Log: Yeah, but they were just 
like, they were just very-they 

0:22:25.300,0:22:28.200
were just everywhere ‘cause I got a hold 
of them whenever I was five. I ate an 

0:22:28.200,0:22:30.629
ear wax jellybean and I could 
taste it for like a month.

0:22:30.629,0:22:30.641
[Gir laughs]

0:22:30.641,0:22:31.523
Baaulp, disgusted: Eeuh.

0:22:31.523,0:22:31.554
Log: And I couldn’t stand it.

0:22:31.554,0:22:33.750
Trog: I think I had one that 
was like, pencil shaving.

0:22:33.750,0:22:36.360
Wayne: You remember that those 
jellybeans came with like, 

0:22:36.360,0:22:39.948
trading cards of their like, 
teachers? Isn’t that a little weird?

0:22:39.948,0:22:42.780
Trog: Yeah. Eh, a little bit, but whatever.

0:22:42.780,0:22:45.360
Wayne: Like, you’re at your 
own school and you buy some 

0:22:45.360,0:22:48.480
jellybeans from the lunchroom and you 
get a trading card of your math teacher, 

0:22:48.480,0:22:50.019
who dresses up as Quailman every year.

0:22:50.019,0:22:51.600
Trog: [Laughs] Well, that’s not exactly the same—

0:22:51.600,0:22:54.390
Gir: But your math teacher’s 
not like, world renowned.

0:22:54.390,0:22:57.900
Trog: Yeah, it’d be like if 
you went to a school where all 

0:22:57.900,0:23:01.980
of your teachers were incredibly famous 
celebrities. Like-like your gym teacher 

0:23:01.980,0:23:05.460
is Brad Pitt and you get a Brad 
Pitt trading card at the lunchroom.

0:23:05.460,0:23:06.540
Wayne: That’s true.

0:23:06.540,0:23:07.403
Baaulp: That’s still weird!

0:23:07.403,0:23:07.422
Wayne: It’s true.

0:23:07.422,0:23:08.800
Gir: It’s still weird, but it’s understandable.

0:23:08.800,0:23:08.814
[Wayne laughs]

0:23:08.814,0:23:10.440
Trog: But at least it makes more sense.

0:23:10.440,0:23:11.460
Gir: Yeah.

0:23:11.460,0:23:13.008
Wayne: Oh, that’d be so…

0:23:13.008,0:23:15.600
Baaulp: Why were kids in Harry 
Potter so dumb? Why’d they 

0:23:15.600,0:23:18.326
eat candy that tasted bad on purpose?

0:23:18.326,0:23:20.700
Trog: Why did kids in real life eat candy  

0:23:20.700,0:23:21.324
that taste bad on
purpose?

0:23:21.324,0:23:23.321
Gir: [Laughs] You fuckin’… 
what are you talking about?

0:23:23.321,0:23:23.880
Baaulp: I only ate good candy.

0:23:23.880,0:23:26.280
Log: Bro, the social studies banner just went up,  

0:23:26.280,0:23:28.200
I got a five-star
Mrs. O’Neal.

0:23:28.200,0:23:29.023
Trog: Hell yeah.

0:23:29.023,0:23:32.262
Wayne, laughing: I got a-I got an SR Mrs. Jackson.

0:23:32.262,0:23:32.274
[Gir laughs]

0:23:32.274,0:23:36.420
Trog: Okay, so now I have an 
addendum question that I just 

0:23:36.420,0:23:38.280
came up with to the costume discussion.

0:23:38.280,0:23:39.183
Baaulp: Mhmm.

0:23:39.183,0:23:42.840
Trog: Um, you’re transported 
back to the ages of ten, but 

0:23:42.840,0:23:48.060
with your current 2020 adult brain, 
what do you pick as your costume?

0:23:48.060,0:23:49.185
Baaulp: Power Ranger.

0:23:49.185,0:23:51.060
Trog: [Laughs] You don’t change it,  

0:23:51.060,0:23:52.358
you’re still Power
Ranger?

0:23:52.358,0:23:52.372
[Wayne laughs]

0:23:52.372,0:23:56.700
Baaulp: Yeah, dude I mean, if 
I go back in time, I’m thinking 

0:23:56.700,0:24:00.360
like, “Okay, how do I make my 
kid self look cool? I mean,  

0:24:00.360,0:24:01.440
what’s popular right
now"—

0:24:01.440,0:24:03.420
Trog: I mean, that’s true. 
That’s one way to take it.

0:24:03.420,0:24:06.660
Baaulp: Fuckin’, sick ass 
Green Ranger costume with  

0:24:06.660,0:24:07.734
the flute
dagger.

0:24:07.734,0:24:07.793
[Baaulp and Wayne sing the 
Green Ranger’s summoning song]

0:24:07.793,0:24:13.560
Wayne: Uh, CeeLo Green that one time he  

0:24:13.560,0:24:14.671
dressed up as a
golden man.

0:24:14.671,0:24:14.694
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:24:14.694,0:24:15.600
Trog: Yeah.

0:24:15.600,0:24:16.744
Gir: [Laughs] Just beat him to it.

0:24:16.744,0:24:20.561
Wayne: I mean I just want 
that costume now, frankly.

0:24:20.561,0:24:20.572
Trog: Yeah.

0:24:20.572,0:24:25.380
Baaulp: That—Oh, we should talk 
about that later, ‘cause I—Let’s 

0:24:25.380,0:24:26.520
go around, what are your answers?

0:24:26.520,0:24:29.580
Gir: What was popular seventeen years ago?

0:24:29.580,0:24:33.240
Trog: Well, let me set the stage. The year is uh,  

0:24:33.240,0:24:34.782
around let’s
say 1999.

0:24:34.782,0:24:34.794
Gir: 1999…

0:24:34.794,0:24:40.260
Trog: Uh, I think uh, y’know, 
the movie—the Adam Sandler 

0:24:40.260,0:24:42.540
comedy Big Daddy has taken the world by storm.

0:24:42.540,0:24:44.190
Wayne: You were ten in 1999?

0:24:44.190,0:24:45.060
Trog: No, I wasn’t.

0:24:45.060,0:24:46.440
Wayne: None of us were.

0:24:46.440,0:24:47.935
Trog: I don’t know how old everybody is.

0:24:47.935,0:24:48.720
Gir: You were six.

0:24:48.720,0:24:49.853
Trog: I was six in 1999.

0:24:49.853,0:24:53.880
Wayne: If it was 1999—If I was 
1999, my costume would be a 

0:24:53.880,0:24:57.480
large notepad with detailed 
instructions on how to thwart 9/11.

0:24:57.480,0:25:03.281
[Trog, Gir, and Log laugh]

0:25:03.281,0:25:04.620
Trog:  

0:25:04.620,0:25:07.200
I don’t even want to say 
mine anymore, I can’t come up 

0:25:07.200,0:25:08.820
with anything funnier than that.

0:25:08.820,0:25:09.191
[Everyone laughs]

0:25:09.191,0:25:13.200
Gir: Uh, Wayne, I’m gonna 
go as that, but because I’m 

0:25:13.200,0:25:14.340
already ten it’s already post-9/11.

0:25:14.340,0:25:17.640
Trog: Yeah, fuck, I’m just 
gonna go as the lottery numbers, 

0:25:17.640,0:25:18.814
here you go Mom and Dad.

0:25:18.814,0:25:18.835
[Wayne and Gir laugh]

0:25:18.835,0:25:22.800
Log: The pressure is on for 
your neighborhood, Wayne.

0:25:22.800,0:25:25.352
[Wayne and Trog laugh]

0:25:25.352,0:25:29.580
Baaulp: Imagine a kid who wakes 
up and they’re automatically 

0:25:29.580,0:25:37.500
already dressed as like a golden golem 
and like, etched onto the armor is like, 

0:25:37.500,0:25:42.600
instructions in English on a terrorist 
attack that is yet to happen yet and 

0:25:42.600,0:25:43.320
just numbers.

0:25:43.320,0:25:45.000
Wayne: That’s the greatest story never told.

0:25:45.000,0:25:48.840
Trog: That would fuck-like—Imagine 
that you’re a parent and 

0:25:48.840,0:25:53.340
you wake up and your kid starts talking 
to you about a terrorist attack, like… 

0:25:53.880,0:25:56.258
I can’t imagine anything scarier.

0:25:56.258,0:25:56.272
[Wayne laughs]

0:25:56.272,0:25:58.200
Baaulp: I mean, they knew about Oo-sama  

0:25:58.200,0:25:58.975
Bin Laden already,
right?

0:25:58.975,0:25:59.490
Gir: Oo-sama.

0:25:59.490,0:26:00.240
Trog: Yeah.

0:26:00.240,0:26:04.200
Baaulp: Yeah, so your kid’s 
just naming like, political 

0:26:04.200,0:26:08.700
figures in the Middle East and like, 
“Oh, what do we need to do to stop this 

0:26:08.700,0:26:12.573
event from happening, also here’s 
the lottery numbers for this year.”

0:26:12.573,0:26:12.595
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:26:12.595,0:26:18.120
Gir: Hey Baaulp, you know what’s 
cool? I recently heard that 

0:26:18.120,0:26:23.580
uh, time travel’s mathematically 
possible because the universe will just 

0:26:23.580,0:26:25.380
correct itself to what was gonna happen anyway,  

0:26:26.100,0:26:30.540
so you would—by doing that you
think you’re helping, but you just end up  

0:26:30.540,0:26:32.681
in a mental hospital and it happens
anyway.

0:26:32.681,0:26:32.692
Trog: Damn.

0:26:32.692,0:26:33.900
Baaulp: Oh no.

0:26:33.900,0:26:36.106
Wayne: I would take precautions, I would act like—

0:26:36.106,0:26:36.833
Log: They put the ten-year-old in—

0:26:36.833,0:26:39.660
Wayne: Here’s—Here’s how 
you do it, you need the core 

0:26:39.660,0:26:44.100
information of course, how to actually 
like, change the exact day, but you also 

0:26:44.100,0:26:48.000
need information that proves you’re 
right. Like, you need extra information 

0:26:48.000,0:26:51.420
about the future that can be 
proven true immediately. Like,  

0:26:51.420,0:26:53.263
if I know that I’m
going to October—

0:26:53.263,0:26:54.540
Log: It needs to go into your Halloween costume.

0:26:54.540,0:26:55.620
Wayne: Yes—[laughs].

0:26:55.620,0:26:57.780
Gir: You tell them what they were gonna  

0:26:57.780,0:26:58.380
get you for
Christmas.

0:26:58.380,0:27:03.180
Trog: On December 13th, 1999, the movie 
Bicentennial man will be released,  

0:27:03.180,0:27:04.721
and it will get mediocre reviews.

0:27:04.721,0:27:04.733
[Gir laughs]

0:27:04.733,0:27:07.740
Wayne: Like you just need to 
write down and memorize as many 

0:27:07.740,0:27:12.750
like, stupid little facts about like, 
Big Fat Liar and all those movies, like—

0:27:12.750,0:27:13.380
[Trog laughs]

0:27:13.380,0:27:16.260
Baaulp: When you take me to go 
watch the Digimon movie, for some 

0:27:16.260,0:27:19.541
reason there’s going to be an Angela 
Anaconda segment that comes before it.

0:27:19.541,0:27:19.555
[Wayne laughs]

0:27:19.555,0:27:22.920
Gir: You know what, that’s 
perfect, ‘cause who the fuck 

0:27:22.920,0:27:23.820
would have seen that coming?

0:27:23.820,0:27:28.080
Trog: Exactly. It proves you’re 
right. This is a great idea 

0:27:28.080,0:27:31.260
for a movie, I think we should 
start a spec script for this.

0:27:31.260,0:27:34.140
Wayne: The extra fucked thing 
you could do is also like, target 

0:27:34.140,0:27:37.140
your parents specifically to make sure 
you get them on board immediately, and 

0:27:37.140,0:27:40.980
like tell them information that you know 
that they know because they told you 

0:27:40.980,0:27:43.174
when you were older but didn’t 
tell you when you were ten.

0:27:43.174,0:27:43.193
Baaulp: Oooh, yeah.

0:27:43.193,0:27:45.780
Wayne: Like secrets about their life, or whatever.

0:27:45.780,0:27:47.753
Trog: This is scary, this 
is like a thriller movie.

0:27:47.753,0:27:50.340
Wayne: We could talk about this 
for the rest of the podcast, 

0:27:50.340,0:27:50.864
the uh—

0:27:50.864,0:27:50.875
Trog: Yeah.

0:27:50.875,0:27:53.040
Gir: Hold on, I just realized 
what costume I’d—I would dress 

0:27:53.040,0:27:54.360
up as one of the kids from Holes.

0:27:54.360,0:27:55.830
Baaulp: Why that?

0:27:55.830,0:27:57.600
Log: So, like a child prisoner.

0:27:57.600,0:27:59.700
Wayne: So, you’re just in an orange jumpsuit  

0:27:59.700,0:28:00.540
with dirt on
your face.

0:28:00.540,0:28:01.548
Gir: I wanna be a prisoner.

0:28:01.548,0:28:03.240
Wayne: Hey, I mean that movie was dope back then.

0:28:03.240,0:28:05.640
Gir: I wanna eat-I wanna eat canned peaches.

0:28:05.640,0:28:06.840
Wayne: I loved Holes.

0:28:06.840,0:28:08.760
Trog: It was jarred peaches, I think,  

0:28:08.760,0:28:09.420
thank you very
much.

0:28:09.420,0:28:11.700
Gir: Jarred—Well, shut the 
hell up, I don’t know what  

0:28:11.700,0:28:12.360
containers
are.

0:28:12.360,0:28:13.920
Trog: Alright, alright, whatever. Next topic.

0:28:13.920,0:28:17.100
Baaulp: Uh, next topic, why did 
CeeLo Green dress like that? 

0:28:17.100,0:28:20.520
I-I think that was after like, 
his career went into the dumpster—

0:28:20.520,0:28:22.140
Wayne: I mean, that was like his final stunt.

0:28:22.140,0:28:24.120
Baaulp: Yeah, that was his final stunt,  

0:28:24.120,0:28:25.860
was to, “I’m gonna
go as a golem.”

0:28:25.860,0:28:29.400
Wayne: He sealed himself in 
gold and probably died in the 

0:28:29.400,0:28:33.000
costume. Like, it’s sad, 
but… it was a crazy stunt.

0:28:33.000,0:28:35.700
Gir: Yeah, I don’t think he’s 
done anything since then.

0:28:35.700,0:28:38.940
Trog: I tried looking up, “CeeLo 
Green golden golem,” and it 

0:28:38.940,0:28:40.463
took me to the Dark Souls wiki.

0:28:40.463,0:28:40.493
[Wayne, Log, and Baaulp laugh]

0:28:40.493,0:28:45.660
Wayne: Oh man, I want a mod that makes Smough  

0:28:45.660,0:28:46.842
into CeeLo
Green, now.

0:28:46.842,0:28:46.855
[Trog laughs]

0:28:46.855,0:28:49.860
Gir: Oh, CeeLo Green released two things-or,  

0:28:49.860,0:28:51.180
he released an
album this year.

0:28:51.180,0:28:52.920
Wayne: He made two things, wow.

0:28:52.920,0:28:53.520
Gir: Yeah.

0:28:53.520,0:28:56.340
Wayne: I-y’know, I made more 
than two things this year so, 

0:28:56.340,0:28:57.660
CeeLo Green, step up.

0:28:57.660,0:28:58.264
Baaulp: Yeah, same.

0:28:58.263,0:28:58.867
Trog: It’s great.

0:28:58.867,0:29:00.540
Gir: Baaulp, have you made a hundred things?

0:29:00.540,0:29:01.253
Trog: That was last year.

0:29:01.253,0:29:01.740
Wayne: Oh, yeah!

0:29:01.740,0:29:04.680
Baaulp: I’ve made a hundred things by  

0:29:04.680,0:29:06.540
now, but I didn’t miss
my—I missed my goal last year.

0:29:06.540,0:29:07.800
Wayne: I forgot about that.

0:29:07.800,0:29:11.460
Baaulp: I ended up like, with 
seventyish things. Turns out 

0:29:11.460,0:29:12.480
making things is hard.

0:29:12.480,0:29:13.140
Gir: Yeah.

0:29:13.140,0:29:15.840
Trog; I remember us talking 
about our goals for the year and 

0:29:15.840,0:29:18.540
I immediately forgot mine, so 
I think I failed it by default.

0:29:18.540,0:29:20.700
Wayne: Who knows. That shit don’t matter.

0:29:20.700,0:29:22.500
Baaulp: I mean, no. When we  

0:29:22.500,0:29:27.600
recorded-we recorded an episode
late 2019 about our New Year’s  

0:29:27.600,0:29:32.100
resolutions. Mine was to do standup comedy, I
was actually getting the ball rolling on that,  

0:29:32.100,0:29:34.229
but the problem was, uh, then Covid
happened—

0:29:34.229,0:29:34.252
Trog: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

0:29:34.252,0:29:37.140
Baaulp: —and there were no 
more standup comedy shows, and 

0:29:37.140,0:29:39.840
now they’re weird because like, a lot of comedians  

0:29:39.840,0:29:41.940
have like figured out like, “
Yeah we can do them, but they  

0:29:41.940,0:29:47.280
have to be virtual,” but like, standup comedy is
missing so much when there’s not a live audience,  

0:29:47.280,0:29:52.470
or like—and you can’t- y’know
like, it-it’s-it’s weird.

0:29:52.470,0:29:55.680
Gir: Standup comedy with a virtual audience is  

0:29:55.680,0:29:56.640
just being a
streamer.

0:29:56.640,0:29:57.660
Baaulp: Exactly.

0:29:57.660,0:29:58.233
Trog: Kind of.

0:29:58.233,0:29:59.160
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:29:59.160,0:30:01.440
Trog: I don’t know, I think 
there’s something kind of funny 

0:30:01.440,0:30:04.920
and cosmic about somebody standing on 
a stage and telling jokes and like, 

0:30:04.920,0:30:06.775
pausing for laughter but it 
not actually being there.

0:30:06.775,0:30:07.800
Gir: Because of the delay.

0:30:07.800,0:30:08.340
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:30:08.340,0:30:11.460
Gir: Then there’s one person 
with a lot of latency, so they 

0:30:11.460,0:30:13.680
start laughing like, five 
minutes after everyone else.

0:30:13.680,0:30:16.064
[A moment of silence]

0:30:16.064,0:30:19.260
Wayne: [Laughs] Sorry, I 
was laughing about Quailman.

0:30:19.260,0:30:20.220
Trog: That’s great.

0:30:20.220,0:30:21.420
Wayne: Cut that out.

0:30:21.420,0:30:22.140
[Trog and Gir laugh]

0:30:22.140,0:30:23.508
Baaulp: Alright, I’ll cut that out,  

0:30:23.508,0:30:25.344
I’ll cut that out, I’ll
fix it in post [laughs].

0:30:25.344,0:30:26.460
Wayne: Keep that. That was the  

0:30:26.460,0:30:27.420
best-that was the best joke 

0:30:27.420,0:30:30.954
of the episode. Like, do you get it? It’s 
delayed laughter, we’re on latency [laughs].

0:30:30.954,0:30:33.360
Trog: We should have a “Best 
Joke of the Episode” award that 

0:30:33.360,0:30:34.967
we hand out at the end of each episode.

0:30:34.967,0:30:35.700
Baaulp: Hey, that-hey,  

0:30:35.700,0:30:41.160
honestly? I’ve tried-I’ve tried to
like—‘cause so far this podcast-I mean,  

0:30:41.160,0:30:44.100
this podcast has had a few episodes,
yeah—

0:30:44.100,0:30:44.512
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Has been bad, has sucked.

0:30:44.512,0:30:47.640
Baaulp: —We’re really still like, 
testing the waters, and I’ve 

0:30:47.640,0:30:51.720
tried to talk about what segments we 
could introduce, and so far this show is 

0:30:51.720,0:30:55.440
just what we do—we talk, we chitchat 
about what we’ve done since last time, 

0:30:56.160,0:31:03.840
which we can still talk about that, and 
then questions. I think a-we—I tried to 

0:31:03.840,0:31:10.320
introduce a segment where we talk about 
how we could get this podcast to be 

0:31:10.320,0:31:14.820
more popular, but we ran out of ideas, 
I like that idea, though. I think we 

0:31:14.820,0:31:18.240
should have a “Best Joke of the Episode.”

0:31:18.240,0:31:19.740
Trog: But the episode’s not over.

0:31:19.740,0:31:23.340
Baaulp: What it should be is 
we all say a joke right now, 

0:31:23.340,0:31:25.200
and we have to vote on who wins.

0:31:25.200,0:31:25.920
Trog: But it, but—

0:31:25.920,0:31:26.520
Wayne: Fuck no.

0:31:26.520,0:31:26.760
Log: No.

0:31:26.760,0:31:27.360
Gir: Fuck that.

0:31:27.360,0:31:28.358
Wayne: I veto this shit.

0:31:28.358,0:31:28.375
Baaulp: You veto?

0:31:28.375,0:31:30.780
Log: Also, I don’t remember any 
of the stuff you said before 

0:31:30.780,0:31:33.240
that. I don’t remember that ever happening.

0:31:33.240,0:31:36.480
Wayne: Like, okay. This concept, 
putting us on the spot, say 

0:31:36.480,0:31:40.955
a joke, and then whoever tells the 
best one wins, is like-that’s not—

0:31:40.955,0:31:40.974
Baaulp: Say a joke.

0:31:40.974,0:31:44.863
Trog: It’s like a nightmare scenario. 
It’s like, “Hey, be funny right now.”

0:31:44.863,0:31:44.875
Wayne: Yeah.

0:31:44.875,0:31:49.440
Log: Bringing the unfortunate like, 
social interaction that standup 

0:31:49.440,0:31:52.368
comedians have to deal with into the online realm.

0:31:52.368,0:31:53.640
Trog: Yeah. Do it to your friends.

0:31:53.640,0:31:55.680
Gir: Oh, you’re a comedian? Tell me a joke.

0:31:55.680,0:31:59.760
Wayne: I have made a name for 
myself through comedy, I can’t—You 

0:31:59.760,0:32:03.780
can’t just tell me to do a joke and I 
do one, like I never do that. I would 

0:32:03.780,0:32:07.084
just say like, “I don’t know, 
fuckin’-fart. Get out of my face.”

0:32:07.084,0:32:07.099
[Baaulp laughs]

0:32:07.099,0:32:07.132
Gir: Poop come out of butt, haha.

0:32:07.132,0:32:09.240
Baaulp: That’s a pretty good joke.

0:32:09.240,0:32:11.340
Trog: It’s all-we’re all—Look. We-we all do  

0:32:11.340,0:32:12.480
situational
comedy.

0:32:12.480,0:32:13.380
Wayne: I guess.

0:32:13.380,0:32:17.820
Trog: We all do situational 
comedy, we don’t write jokes, we’ve 

0:32:17.820,0:32:21.818
talked about how we don’t write 
jokes on this podcast like, twice.

0:32:21.818,0:32:21.835
Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

0:32:21.835,0:32:26.460
Log: I’m thinkin’ though, ‘cause 
like, yeah. People still do 

0:32:26.460,0:32:30.360
that, they’ll still like, “Oh, you’re a 
comedian? Can you tell me a joke?” What 

0:32:30.360,0:32:34.500
are they expecting? ‘Cause that’s not 
what comedians do now. They don’t just 

0:32:34.500,0:32:38.154
like-they don’t make like, walks-into-a-bar 
jokes or anything like that.

0:32:38.154,0:32:39.415
Trog: I mean, it kind of depends on the comedian.

0:32:39.415,0:32:42.720
Log: It’s all just about—It’s 
like all about their life and 

0:32:42.720,0:32:46.620
stuff. Like the closest you can get with 
like a real-with like a person that’s 

0:32:46.620,0:32:50.034
alive right now is maybe Demetri Martin 
can get you what you need, maybe.

0:32:50.034,0:32:53.220
Trog: Yeah, I was about to say, 
I was about to name Demetri 

0:32:53.220,0:32:57.120
Martin as well, like as the one comedian 
I can think of that literally just 

0:32:57.120,0:33:01.560
gets on a stage and just tells jokes. Just 
like setup, punchline. Setup, punchline.

0:33:01.560,0:33:04.380
Log: But even then, you ambush 
him and he doesn’t have a 

0:33:04.380,0:33:05.679
sketchpad, he doesn’t have a guitar.

0:33:05.679,0:33:05.694
[Baaulp laughs]

0:33:05.694,0:33:06.900
Trog: Yeah, he doesn’t have his guitar.

0:33:06.900,0:33:09.456
Baaulp: Yeah, he’s nothing 
without that fuckin’ sketchpad.

0:33:09.456,0:33:10.800
Log: He’s defenseless.

0:33:10.800,0:33:13.680
Trog: I don’t know if anybody—This 
is not a slight against 

0:33:13.680,0:33:16.440
Demetri Martin, Demetri Martin, if 
you’re listening to this podcast,  

0:33:16.440,0:33:17.486
I think you’re
very funny—

0:33:17.486,0:33:17.514
Baaulp: Oh yeah, I’m sure.

0:33:17.514,0:33:18.660
Trog: —but, I feel like—

0:33:18.660,0:33:20.100
Log: Yeah, he’s the only standup comedian  

0:33:20.100,0:33:20.934
I’ve seen in real
life, he’s cool.

0:33:20.934,0:33:22.260
Trog: But I feel like,  

0:33:22.260,0:33:27.120
um, I feel like nobody’s thought
about Demetri Martin since like, 2009, maybe.

0:33:27.120,0:33:28.740
Gir: I have no idea who it is.

0:33:28.740,0:33:29.520
Trog: Exactly.  

0:33:30.180,0:33:34.241
 Demetri Martin, come back. Come on our
podcast. You-you should be funny with us.

0:33:34.241,0:33:35.520
Wayne: Do you know Eugene Mirman?

0:33:35.520,0:33:36.212
Gir: What?

0:33:36.212,0:33:36.233
Baaulp and Log: What?

0:33:36.233,0:33:38.310
Wayne: Okay, no one knows who Eugene Mirman.

0:33:38.310,0:33:39.720
Baaulp: That name sounds familiar.

0:33:39.720,0:33:42.360
Wayne: It’s like, it’s some 
comedian that like, my older brother 

0:33:42.360,0:33:45.180
showed me when I was a kid that I 
used to think was so fucking funny, 

0:33:45.180,0:33:49.140
and I remember him vividly for that, and 
also because I logged onto his website 

0:33:49.140,0:33:52.380
and it had something that was borderline 
a screamer whenever you logged into 

0:33:52.380,0:33:56.640
it, and uh, that-that—I wiped whatever 
the fuck it was out of my memory.

0:33:56.640,0:33:58.200
Trog: It’s-it’s gone now.

0:33:58.200,0:34:00.120
Wayne: Yeah, I mean I don’t 
want to think about it,  

0:34:00.120,0:34:00.660
it was
scary.

0:34:00.660,0:34:04.920
Gir: The uh, only comedians 
I really watched when I was 

0:34:04.920,0:34:07.554
younger I will not speak of 
them as an adult [laughs].

0:34:07.554,0:34:11.280
Trog: Yeah. Standup comedy’s 
changed. I was just thinking 

0:34:11.280,0:34:16.740
about the fact that I think my first 
exposure to standup comedy were these series 

0:34:16.740,0:34:23.520
of YouTube videos where somebody just 
took like, standup comedy albums, or just 

0:34:23.520,0:34:28.380
like, individual tracks from standup 
comedy albums, and then made them into 

0:34:28.380,0:34:34.140
like, a Naruto AMV. Like, it’s 
not an AMV because it’s not—

0:34:34.140,0:34:35.922
Gir: I know exactly what 
you’re talking about ‘cause I—

0:34:35.922,0:34:37.140
Baaulp: I think I know what 
you’re talking about, too.

0:34:37.140,0:34:40.080
Trog: Right? Have you guys seen 
those? They’re like, so—I’m 

0:34:40.080,0:34:41.340
talking about, this was like-this was probably  

0:34:41.340,0:34:45.090
like, 2004. This was like,
early, early, early YouTube.

0:34:45.090,0:34:47.520
Gir: ‘Cause I remember specifically like,  

0:34:47.520,0:34:48.522
Little Tortilla
Boy.

0:34:48.522,0:34:48.534
Wayne: What?

0:34:48.534,0:34:50.940
Trog: Yeah, there’s like—I don’t 
even know who that comedian 

0:34:50.940,0:34:52.200
is, but I remember that joke.

0:34:52.200,0:34:55.500
Gir: That was-I think that was-I 
think that was…. Oh, what’s 

0:34:55.500,0:34:57.600
that dude that’s really 
obnoxious and no one likes him…

0:34:57.600,0:34:59.100
Trog: Wow, damn. Got him.

0:34:59.100,0:35:00.120
Wayne: The one who steals jokes?

0:35:00.120,0:35:01.980
Trog: No, it’s not Carlos Mencia.

0:35:01.980,0:35:04.380
Gir: No, his deal was he-he  

0:35:05.640,0:35:07.002
like, did the like, McDonald’s
drive-thru joke.

0:35:07.002,0:35:07.860
Trog: Oh, uh, oh! Dane Cook,  

0:35:07.860,0:35:08.455
I think is who you’re thinking
of. Yeah, Dane Cook.

0:35:08.455,0:35:10.500
Gir: Dane Cook! Yeah. Yeah,  

0:35:10.500,0:35:12.054
I think it was Dane Cook that
did the Little Tortilla Boy joke.

0:35:12.054,0:35:14.760
Trog: There was a Dane Cook 
one, there was a Dave Chappelle 

0:35:14.760,0:35:19.500
one, but I-I was just—like it just 
dawned on me that, wow, that was my first 

0:35:19.500,0:35:25.980
exposure to standup comedy were these 
ancient YouTube vid—like, Naruto YouTube 

0:35:25.980,0:35:28.173
videos. It’s so weird to think about.

0:35:28.173,0:35:28.194
Gir: I remember that.

0:35:28.194,0:35:31.200
Trog: I don’t even like Naru—I 
didn’t even watch Naruto as a kid,  

0:35:31.200,0:35:33.583
but I loved those videos ‘cause of the standup.

0:35:33.583,0:35:36.240
Gir: See, okay, it’s funny you 
say that because I remember 

0:35:36.240,0:35:41.040
the same thing, but people did it with 
fucking Kingdom Hearts cutscenes. And I don’t 

0:35:41.040,0:35:43.118
like Kingdom Hearts but I did love those videos!

0:35:43.118,0:35:43.132
[Wayne laughs]

0:35:43.132,0:35:47.100
Baaulp: Yeah, like, even 
though there was no money to be 

0:35:47.100,0:35:50.880
made, people wanted to go viral, so when 
someone had a good idea people like, 

0:35:50.880,0:35:51.720
just copied them.

0:35:51.720,0:35:54.286
Trog: Yeah, people still do it to this very day.

0:35:54.286,0:35:54.570
Baaulp: Yeah. Yup.

0:35:54.570,0:35:58.620
Gir: People have done that as long as something 
has been popular. If something is popular  

0:35:58.620,0:36:02.760
someone else wants to do it, too, so they are 
popular. That’s just human-the human nature.

0:36:02.760,0:36:04.020
Trog: That’s right, I’m calling you out,  

0:36:04.020,0:36:07.789
Nikola Tesla. You thought you 
could invent electricity second?

0:36:07.789,0:36:09.420
Wayne: You don’t-no, don’t talk-no,  

0:36:09.420,0:36:11.340
don’t be mean to him, he
made my cool unicycle.

0:36:11.340,0:36:12.540
Trog: Oh, well.

0:36:12.540,0:36:14.460
Wayne: Don’t be-do that. Don’t be do that.

0:36:14.460,0:36:15.900
Gir: He didn’t make your unicycle.

0:36:15.900,0:36:17.700
Wayne: Yes he did his name’s on it! It says  

0:36:17.700,0:36:19.260
Nikola on it, it
has to be him.

0:36:19.260,0:36:23.640
Baaulp: I was a really weird 
kid in that like, when most 

0:36:23.640,0:36:28.200
kids came home from school and watched 
cartoons, but at some point after we got 

0:36:28.200,0:36:31.440
like, basic cable, we had Comedy Central, 
and I realized like, wait a minute, there’s 

0:36:31.440,0:36:36.000
just—I could watch cartoons, but the 
only cartoon I cared about watching was 

0:36:36.000,0:36:40.260
Yu-Gi-Oh! ‘cause it was-it was that era 
where like things were starting to get 

0:36:40.260,0:36:44.340
like, really bad and I like, started not 
to care about cartoons anymore, I was 

0:36:44.340,0:36:48.060
like, wait a minute, I could just come 
home after school and there’s just a 

0:36:48.060,0:36:52.260
channel that has standup comedy, I could 
watch that. So I was watching like—They 

0:36:52.260,0:36:56.700
would air the Chappelle Show, like reruns 
of the Chappelle Show and then they 

0:36:56.700,0:37:01.020
would air like—Comedy Central used to 
air a lot of standup, I watched that, I 

0:37:01.020,0:37:04.080
would watch people’s standup 
specials, I was a weird kid.

0:37:04.080,0:37:06.840
Wayne: What was the—when 
you were a kid, what was the 

0:37:06.840,0:37:10.440
cartoon that was the breaking point for 
you. Where you watched it and you would 

0:37:10.440,0:37:12.480
like—where you watched it 
and you just thought like,  

0:37:12.480,0:37:14.580
“I’m too old for this now.
Like this is not—”

0:37:14.580,0:37:16.373
Baaulp: Oh, like the turning 
point where it’s like, oh—

0:37:16.373,0:37:17.400
Wayne: The turning point.

0:37:17.400,0:37:24.540
Baaulp: I think for me it wasn’t 
cartoons, it-for me it was 

0:37:24.540,0:37:27.701
when Nickelodeon started like 
putting more live action—

0:37:27.701,0:37:28.315
Wayne: [Crosstalk] Live action.

0:37:28.315,0:37:30.030
Gir: Cartoon Network started 
doing live action stuff.

0:37:30.030,0:37:33.540
Baaulp: It was legitimately, 
I think like, Drake & Josh.

0:37:33.540,0:37:37.561
Trog: What? Drake & Josh was good!

0:37:37.561,0:37:37.612
Wayne: I liked Drake & 
Josh. Drake & Josh was good.

0:37:37.612,0:37:39.180
Baaulp: I don’t know, I watched it—

0:37:39.180,0:37:41.160
Wayne: Here’s the thing, Baaulp. 
I’m not saying like-I’m not 

0:37:41.160,0:37:44.820
saying like, “What? You don’t like 
Drake & Josh? You fucking freak! I’m 

0:37:44.820,0:37:51.360
gonna slam you on the pavement!” Like, 
the-like the thing with like, you have a 

0:37:51.360,0:37:54.100
much stranger history with TV than we do—

0:37:54.100,0:37:54.113
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:37:54.113,0:37:57.120
Wayne: —like you were watching 
Seinfeld at five, so like, it 

0:37:57.120,0:38:01.320
makes sense that you would step away 
from that in a different way than we did, 

0:38:01.320,0:38:04.680
but I think around the time of 
iCarly that is probably when I  

0:38:04.680,0:38:05.340
also stepped
away.

0:38:05.340,0:38:05.760
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:38:05.760,0:38:09.240
Gir: I have a twisted sense of television history  

0:38:09.240,0:38:10.200
as well
because—

0:38:10.200,0:38:10.872
Trog: Gir’s a little twisted.

0:38:10.872,0:38:13.305
Gir: Between—Fuck you, bitch.

0:38:13.305,0:38:15.869
Trog: He’s a little—he’s a little unhinged.

0:38:15.869,0:38:15.895
Wayne: A little fucked up.

0:38:15.895,0:38:19.020
Gir: Between 2008-between 2008—

0:38:19.020,0:38:19.661
Wayne: A little insane.

0:38:19.661,0:38:24.600
Gir: Thank you. Between 2008 
and 2012 I lived overseas and I 

0:38:24.600,0:38:26.580
had to watch AFN so I had only like,  

0:38:26.580,0:38:31.500
fucking, reruns of whatever DVD they had
kicking around in the broadcast studio,  

0:38:32.340,0:38:37.200
so when I got back to the United States
and saw whatever like, cartoons were again,  

0:38:38.040,0:38:43.825
it was like, Problem Solverz, and Secret
Mountain Fort Awesome.

0:38:43.825,0:38:44.820
Trog: I have no idea what that is, what is that?

0:38:44.820,0:38:45.360
Wayne: What the fuck?

0:38:45.360,0:38:46.110
Trog: What are you naming?

0:38:46.110,0:38:47.610
Log: You don’t remember Problem Solverz?

0:38:47.610,0:38:48.180
Trog: No.

0:38:48.180,0:38:49.740
Log: Like, that one was notorious.

0:38:49.740,0:38:52.920
Wayne: TV makes us all go a 
little crazy, huh, MasterGir?

0:38:52.920,0:38:56.280
Gir: I was like, “I don’t… think 
I like cartoons anymore if this 

0:38:56.280,0:38:57.049
is what it is, now.”

0:38:57.049,0:38:59.922
Log: Yeah, Trog, Google 
“Problem Solverz” with a Z.

0:38:59.922,0:38:59.933
Trog: Okay.

0:38:59.933,0:39:03.000
Wayne: I remember Problem Solverz 
because I remember seeing it as like,  

0:39:03.000,0:39:07.080
it was this weird like, bridge show between 
Cartoon Network and Adult Swim, I think they  

0:39:07.080,0:39:11.160
wanted it to be on Adult Swim but they didn’t 
get the okay so they had to tone it down.

0:39:11.160,0:39:13.313
Trog: What is this? What is this?

0:39:13.313,0:39:15.360
Wayne: Am I-am I right in remembering that  

0:39:15.360,0:39:16.260
history? Does
anyone else—?

0:39:16.260,0:39:17.460
Gir: That sounds right, yeah.

0:39:17.460,0:39:19.740
Wayne: Adult Swim would start 
at like, eleven and they would 

0:39:19.740,0:39:22.440
air that show at like, ten-thirty 
because they couldn’t quite get it on  

0:39:22.440,0:39:22.980
Adult
Swim.

0:39:22.980,0:39:26.340
Trog: It has the visual style 
of like, an Adult Swim show 

0:39:26.340,0:39:32.700
for sure. That-this is weird, no, I’ve 
never heard, never seen this show, this 

0:39:32.700,0:39:34.735
was like, far past my time, I think.

0:39:34.735,0:39:37.740
Gir: But yeah, like 
anything-anything between the end of 

0:39:37.740,0:39:44.520
2011 and like, early 2013 that was on TV 
I was like, “I don’t like this. I don’t 

0:39:44.520,0:39:46.135
think I want to watch cartoons anymore [laughs].”

0:39:46.135,0:39:49.860
Log: Around the time that I was 
thirteen it was just like, “Alright, 

0:39:49.860,0:39:54.720
well I don’t have cable in my room anymore, 
um, I’m gonna watch Let’s Plays of Silent 

0:39:54.720,0:39:57.941
Hill 3 and Hitman: Blood 
Money now.” And that was it.

0:39:57.941,0:39:57.952
Trog: Yeah.

0:39:57.952,0:40:01.260
Baaulp: I remember what killed 
it-what killed it for me was 

0:40:01.260,0:40:06.420
a combination of me already being a weird 
kid and I would watch like The Simpsons 

0:40:06.420,0:40:10.560
and Seinfeld so like, cartoons were like, 
the only thing cartoons had were like 

0:40:10.560,0:40:15.780
how goofy they were, right? ‘Cause 
you-‘cause you’d get goofy kid stuff but 

0:40:15.780,0:40:20.820
then like, once I started getting older 
and once like both Cartoon Network and 

0:40:20.820,0:40:25.320
Nickelodeon were like trying to bridge 
the gap and have like live action 

0:40:25.320,0:40:30.480
programming I was like, “All that, I like 
all that, ‘cause it’s goofy and Kenan 

0:40:30.480,0:40:35.746
Thompson is in a tub, but he’s fully 
dressed or y’know, weird shit like that—”

0:40:35.746,0:40:35.760
[Wayne laughs]

0:40:35.760,0:40:40.560
Baaulp: But wait, Drake & 
Josh is just a show about 

0:40:40.560,0:40:44.940
people, I don’t care about real people, 
if I wanted to watch that I’d watch 

0:40:44.940,0:40:50.280
Seinfeld, and also I got the Internet, 
yeah, I got the Internet so I like, I 

0:40:50.280,0:40:52.260
just watched like, Let’s Plays and stuff.

0:40:52.260,0:40:55.620
Trog: I feel like the breaking 
point-the breakoff point where 

0:40:55.620,0:41:00.180
I stopped caring about cartoons as much is 
I feel like-I feel like Teen Titans ended 

0:41:00.180,0:41:04.500
and I was like, “Cool, I’m done. I 
did it. I watched all the cartoons.”

0:41:04.500,0:41:07.590
Baaulp: That’s what weaned 
you into like, more serious—

0:41:07.590,0:41:11.280
Trog: Not even that, because 
like honestly, I didn’t even 

0:41:11.280,0:41:16.980
watch much like, serious adult animation 
or anything, I mean like, if you want 

0:41:16.980,0:41:21.360
to count Family Guy or whatever, sure. 
Just because they ran four reruns a day 

0:41:21.360,0:41:22.080
on Adult Swim.

0:41:22.080,0:41:26.160
Wayne: Other than like, iCarly, 
like-like it wasn’t that show 

0:41:26.160,0:41:29.100
specifically, but it was like that era 
whenever I got out of it. It was when 

0:41:29.100,0:41:31.530
Avatar the Last Airbender wrapped up and ended—

0:41:31.530,0:41:32.040
Trog: Yeah.

0:41:32.040,0:41:34.980
Wayne: —and then I was like, 
“Okay, I’m done with that, hmm, 

0:41:34.980,0:41:39.720
these like, episodic, actual stories are 
much cooler than like, Fairly OddParents 

0:41:39.720,0:41:42.300
or whatever the fuck. Um, I’m 
gonna get into Dragon Ball Z.”

0:41:42.300,0:41:43.133
Baaulp: Yeah, whatever Butch Fartman.

0:41:43.133,0:41:45.540
Wayne: And then I got hella into Dragon Ball Z and  

0:41:45.540,0:41:46.560
I still
think—

0:41:46.560,0:41:47.160
Baaulp: Yeahhhh, yeeeeaaaahhhh!

0:41:47.160,0:41:49.260
Wayne: And I still think Dragon Ball Z whips ass.

0:41:49.260,0:41:54.300
Baaulp: Oh man, there is one 
summer as a kid where—they used 

0:41:54.300,0:41:58.980
to air Dragon Ball Z on Cartoon 
Network, like they had an anime block—

0:41:58.980,0:42:01.122
Gir: Mhmm yeah, it was called Toonami.

0:42:01.122,0:42:01.500
Baaulp and Wayne: Yeah.

0:42:01.500,0:42:06.462
Wayne: No, they-they—I feel like before 
Toonami they would air Dragon Ball Z.

0:42:06.462,0:42:06.475
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:42:06.475,0:42:07.380
Gir: Eh-yeah they did.

0:42:07.380,0:42:09.420
Wayne: Like, Dragon Ball Z on 
Cartoon Network predates that.

0:42:09.420,0:42:15.060
Baaulp: And so, like, there was this one summer 
where like, for some reason there was a week—It  

0:42:15.060,0:42:20.220
was brutal, there was a week-almost week 
long power outage in my neighborhood like,  

0:42:20.220,0:42:24.900
it was gross, but there was also a heatwave so my 
parents were like, “Alright, what we’re gonna do  

0:42:24.900,0:42:33.420
is, like, the room that has the most windows is 
our living room, we’re gonna put out a mattress  

0:42:33.420,0:42:38.160
in the living room and we’ll sleep there and you 
can sleep on the couch,” ‘cause that is like,  

0:42:38.160,0:42:42.120
there’s no electricity, right? Like we can’t 
turn on the A/C, we can’t turn on the fan,  

0:42:42.120,0:42:46.920
we just gotta open all the windows and let the 
breeze come in. But after the power came back,  

0:42:46.920,0:42:51.780
they were too lazy to move the mattress 
back, and so there was a week and a half  

0:42:51.780,0:42:56.066
where I would just watch Dragon Ball Z and jump 
on a mattress in the living room, it was dope.

0:42:56.066,0:42:56.093
[Gir, Wayne, and Log laugh]

0:42:56.093,0:43:00.060
Wayne: That’s fucking awesome.

0:43:00.060,0:43:05.520
Gir: That reminds me of how uh, my experience 
with Dragon Ball as a kid was I saw maybe like  

0:43:05.520,0:43:10.620
a cou—a handful of episodes that weren’t even in 
like, sequence, and was like, “Oh, this is kinda  

0:43:10.620,0:43:17.400
cool, I kinda like this,” and then fast forward 
to like, sophomore year high school like, “Man, 

0:43:17.400,0:43:21.120
Dragon Ball seems like it’s kind of 
popular, I should like actually try to watch 

0:43:21.120,0:43:27.420
it from start to finish,” and then I 
fucking marathoned it, and I’m talkin’ 

0:43:27.420,0:43:33.840
like, did not sleep, twenty-four hours 
marathoned all of Dragon Ball Z and by 

0:43:33.840,0:43:38.640
the end of it I was like, “Oh, 
I love this. This is awesome.”

0:43:38.640,0:43:42.240
Wayne: For me I—I like saw 
an episode here and there of 

0:43:42.240,0:43:45.780
Dragon Ball Z of like, of the few times 
I got to watch Cartoon Network, because 

0:43:45.780,0:43:50.580
for some reason like—So, I grew up in a 
Christian family, but not like diehard 

0:43:50.580,0:43:54.480
Christian, we were like Protestant and 
my mom was like, mostly pretty lax, but 

0:43:54.480,0:44:00.720
for some reason she—the first time I 
watched Cartoon Network I watched Zoids 

0:44:00.720,0:44:04.320
and my mom saw Zoids and was like, “This 
channel’s too violent, you can never 

0:44:04.320,0:44:06.696
watch this again. You will watch Nickelodeon.”

0:44:06.696,0:44:06.713
Gir: Unchristian.

0:44:06.713,0:44:09.960
Wayne: Yeah, something about 
Zoids was bad, so yeah, I 

0:44:09.960,0:44:12.480
pretty much didn’t get to watch Cartoon 
Network, and the few times that I did I 

0:44:12.480,0:44:14.760
caught a few episodes of Dragon Ball Z 
and I was like, “This is kinda cool,” 

0:44:14.760,0:44:19.680
and like, I played—and I played Dragon 
Ball Z: Budokai and like, I got a lot of 

0:44:19.680,0:44:22.440
the story from Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 
for the first time, and I thought it was 

0:44:22.440,0:44:26.400
fuckin’ sick and I loved it. That 
game was awesome, but not really, but—

0:44:26.400,0:44:27.720
Gir: It was when you were a kid.

0:44:27.720,0:44:29.700
Wayne: I still have fun playing 
it, but it’s a bad game.

0:44:29.700,0:44:33.120
Baaulp: When anime hit the west 
it hit hard ‘cause it’s like,  

0:44:33.120,0:44:38.640
somehow like—‘Cause they used to make 
like, adventure serials for kids,  

0:44:38.640,0:44:43.920
and then somehow it turned into only 
comedy and only slapstick, and then like—

0:44:43.920,0:44:44.863
Gir: They followed the money.

0:44:44.863,0:44:47.400
Baaulp: And then anime hit, 
and it’s like, “Woah, what is 

0:44:47.400,0:44:52.080
this shit? It’s like, this isn’t funny, 
this is just serious, but it’s for kids 

0:44:52.080,0:44:52.860
like me!”

0:44:52.860,0:44:55.800
Wayne: So yeah, I-I got into 
it through that, and then when 

0:44:55.800,0:44:59.580
I was in middle school I was like, I 
was moving on from cartoons, but I would 

0:44:59.580,0:45:02.460
still watch some Family Guy and there 
was also a channel called Nicktoons 

0:45:02.460,0:45:07.800
Network where they would air like, the 
shows that got cancelled, it was an 

0:45:07.800,0:45:12.660
interesting like, channel in general but, 
they aired-they announced like, “Coming 

0:45:12.660,0:45:16.800
soon to Nicktoons Network, Dragon Ball 
Z Kai,” and I’m like, “Wow, this looks 

0:45:16.800,0:45:20.280
like, much cleaner than it used to, and 
this looks really cool,” and I watched 

0:45:20.280,0:45:24.660
that, and I watched that weekly and it 
was fuckin’ awesome. So, I actually got 

0:45:25.260,0:45:30.360
the full experience of Dragon Ball Z 
up to some point in the Cell Saga like, 

0:45:30.360,0:45:33.480
watching it bi-weekly as if I had actually 
been keeping up with the releases, 

0:45:33.480,0:45:34.620
it was fuckin’ dope.

0:45:34.620,0:45:37.920
Gir: Y’know, that reminds me, 
I want—I’m gonna reel it back 

0:45:37.920,0:45:41.280
once again to Halloween. That reminds 
me of my favorite Halloween memory of 

0:45:41.280,0:45:44.580
going out trick-or-treating, blah blah 
blah, you know all that fun stuff you 

0:45:44.580,0:45:48.420
usually do on Halloween, then coming 
home, turning off all the lights so people 

0:45:48.420,0:45:51.000
don’t try to get candy from us 
‘cause we didn’t have any for them—

0:45:51.000,0:45:51.315
[Baaulp laughs]

0:45:51.315,0:45:55.500
Gir: —and then turning on the 
TV and watching the Nicktoons 

0:45:55.500,0:45:58.980
Network Animation Film-Animated 
Film Festival. I feel like  

0:45:58.980,0:45:59.573
I’ve told this story
before—

0:45:59.573,0:46:00.720
Wayne: I remember that! Yeah.

0:46:00.720,0:46:01.260
Gir: Yeah.

0:46:01.260,0:46:04.140
Wayne: I also remember around 
Halloween time Nickelodeon would 

0:46:04.140,0:46:10.500
have like, these like bumpers between episodes 
of their shows that were like, genuinely 

0:46:10.500,0:46:14.940
scary, like, I don’t-I don’t remember 
much about them, but I bet someone out 

0:46:14.940,0:46:20.520
there does, where it was like this—It 
was a dual tone like, color scheme, it 

0:46:20.520,0:46:23.760
was literally just orange and black, and 
there was this weird like, short dude 

0:46:23.760,0:46:27.420
with long arms just like talking about 
like, “[In a deep voice] Uh, there’s you 

0:46:27.420,0:46:31.440
know—Do you like scary stories? There’s 
one kind and then there’s the other 

0:46:31.440,0:46:35.520
kind.” And then like just a bloody sawblade 
would appear or something like that 

0:46:35.520,0:46:38.184
and it was fuckin’ strange and 
uncharacteristic for Nickelodeon.

0:46:38.184,0:46:38.213
Gir: I don’t remember that.

0:46:38.213,0:46:39.840
Wayne: It scared the shit out of me.

0:46:39.840,0:46:41.149
Trog: No, I think you’re imagining this.

0:46:41.149,0:46:42.060
Wayne: No, it’s definitely real.

0:46:42.060,0:46:45.300
Log: Legend of Sleepy Hollow, 
Headless Horseman slashin’ 

0:46:45.300,0:46:45.960
through your screen!

0:46:45.960,0:46:48.480
Wayne: Nope, nope. [Laughs] 
Cutting through your selfies!

0:46:48.480,0:46:50.340
Gir: Do you remember Prometheus and Bob?

0:46:50.340,0:46:50.940
Baaulp: Yes.

0:46:50.940,0:46:51.559
Trog: Mhmm.

0:46:51.559,0:46:53.205
Gir: Fucking loved Prometheus and Bob.

0:46:53.205,0:46:53.215
Wayne: No.

0:46:53.215,0:46:54.600
Gir: You don’t?

0:46:54.600,0:46:55.500
Wayne: I don’t know what that is.

0:46:55.500,0:46:57.060
Baaulp: I loved KaBlam!.

0:46:57.060,0:46:59.268
Gir: Fucking KaBlam! was so good.

0:46:59.268,0:47:01.800
Wayne: What the fuck—Okay, now 
y’all are just making up things. 

0:47:01.800,0:47:03.720
Didn’t-didn’t you love Alien and George?

0:47:03.720,0:47:04.525
[Log laughs]

0:47:04.525,0:47:08.460
Gir: I mean, that’s what it was! 
It was an alien and a caveman!

0:47:08.460,0:47:10.680
Baaulp: KaBlam! was a variety show.

0:47:10.680,0:47:11.400
Gir: Yeah.

0:47:11.400,0:47:14.220
Baaulp: It was like-it was 
like a sketch variety show, but 

0:47:14.220,0:47:18.900
it—This is why like, Nickelodeon was 
cool. It was a sketch variety show that 

0:47:18.900,0:47:21.240
was a mix of animation, and live action,  

0:47:21.240,0:47:24.420
and Claymation, it was like all
animated in different ways, but it  

0:47:24.420,0:47:29.400
was a sketch variety show, and Prometheus
and Bob was just like, a slapstick,  

0:47:29.400,0:47:34.380
almost Tom and Jerry-esque show like,
little segment they’d have and it was  

0:47:34.380,0:47:39.300
hilarious as a kid because like, Prometheus
was this alien that was desperately trying  

0:47:39.300,0:47:44.160
to teach this caveman like, advanced
concepts and like, it’s slap-it’s like  

0:47:44.160,0:47:47.700
slap—it’s like a different dynamic than
say like, Tom and Jerry where like,  

0:47:47.700,0:47:52.680
they’re enemies like, the alien is genuinely
trying to help the caveman and the caveman  

0:47:52.680,0:47:55.731
just doesn’t get it and like, fucks
everything up and it was hilarious.

0:47:55.731,0:47:57.900
Gir: And there was-and there 
was a monkey that would fuck 

0:47:57.900,0:48:00.480
things up, too, ‘cause the monkey was smarter.

0:48:00.480,0:48:03.300
Wayne: Y’all remember the 
Nickelodeon show that like, to me, 

0:48:03.300,0:48:06.540
all memories of it feel like a 
fever dream, that was about like,  

0:48:06.540,0:48:07.740
a naked action
figure?

0:48:07.740,0:48:09.210
Trog: That was part of KaBlam!.

0:48:09.210,0:48:11.040
Gir: I think that was Action Team Now?

0:48:11.040,0:48:13.500
Wayne: That was part of KaBlam!? 
That’s why-that’s why it 

0:48:13.500,0:48:14.447
came to my memory, I guess.

0:48:14.447,0:48:16.620
Trog: It was either Action Team or Action League,  

0:48:16.620,0:48:17.880
something like
that.

0:48:17.880,0:48:18.240
Gir: Action League.

0:48:18.240,0:48:21.000
Wayne: That shit was weird, 
I don’t remember shit about 

0:48:21.000,0:48:24.060
that. There were many things that scared 
me when I was akid that shouldn’t, I 

0:48:24.060,0:48:27.720
remember that show just, making 
me like vaguely upset, like,  

0:48:27.720,0:48:29.100
whenever I watched
it.

0:48:29.100,0:48:29.258
[Trog laughs]

0:48:29.258,0:48:29.273
Baaulp: Really?

0:48:29.273,0:48:32.252
Wayne: Just this weird sense 
of discontent. It was strange.

0:48:32.252,0:48:33.000
Trog: It was just like, not Claymation,  

0:48:33.000,0:48:34.660
but it was stop motion
action figures.

0:48:34.660,0:48:34.673
Baaulp: Yeah.

0:48:34.673,0:48:36.570
Wayne: It was stop motion of these weird, naked—

0:48:36.570,0:48:40.080
Gir: It was part stop motion 
and part like, toys on strings.

0:48:40.080,0:48:40.500
Trog: Yeah.

0:48:40.500,0:48:43.080
Baaulp: Yeah, them just dragging toys around.

0:48:43.080,0:48:46.320
Wayne: Was there other characters 
than the naked guy? I only 

0:48:46.320,0:48:47.520
remember the naked guy.

0:48:47.520,0:48:48.540
Baaulp: There was a Wonder Woman  

0:48:50.400,0:48:52.050
equivalent, and then there
was Stinky Diver.

0:48:52.050,0:48:55.680
Trog: I remember that, I remember Stinky Diver.  

0:48:55.680,0:48:57.281
What a good
name.

0:48:57.281,0:48:57.295
[Wayne laughs]

0:48:57.295,0:49:00.660
Gir: Wayne, you’re thinking of 
The Flesh. He’s quote, “Super 

0:49:00.660,0:49:02.144
strong and super naked.”

0:49:02.144,0:49:02.880
Trog and Wayne: Yeah.

0:49:02.880,0:49:03.115
Wayne: It’s coming back to me now.

0:49:03.115,0:49:09.180
Gir: He has Thunder Girl, “She flies 
like thunder,” Stinky Diver, “A former  

0:49:09.180,0:49:13.740
Navy commando who has an attitude—with 
an attitude as bad as his odor,” uh,  

0:49:13.740,0:49:17.320
Meltman, my favorite, “With the power to… melt!”

0:49:17.320,0:49:17.335
Trog: Oh, yeah.

0:49:17.335,0:49:20.680
Log: You guys can watch your dumb-dumb shows—

0:49:20.680,0:49:20.695
[Baaulp laughs]

0:49:20.695,0:49:22.710
Log: I was watching fuckin’ Cubix.

0:49:22.710,0:49:22.733
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

0:49:22.733,0:49:26.340
Wayne: Fuck you. Fuck you, bitch.

0:49:26.340,0:49:28.080
Gir: Fuck you and your trash.

0:49:28.080,0:49:31.800
Trog: Log was all in on those-on 
those Korean animations.

0:49:31.800,0:49:35.973
Log: Yo, man, I discovered so 
many secret shows as a five 

0:49:35.973,0:49:39.660
year old, like I was watching 
Cubix, I was watching .hack//Sign.

0:49:39.660,0:49:40.020
[Trog laughs]

0:49:40.020,0:49:40.615
Wayne: What? You were watching .hack at five?

0:49:40.615,0:49:44.700
Log: I didn’t know what .hack//Sign 
was—Yeah! ‘Cause it came 

0:49:44.700,0:49:46.073
on at like, 2AM, like sometime—

0:49:46.073,0:49:48.960
Wayne: Don’t people get—You 
were up at 2AM at five?

0:49:48.960,0:49:50.340
Trog: Why were you up at 2AM?

0:49:50.340,0:49:55.200
Log: Whenever I was a little kid like, 
sometimes over—like sometime-like 

0:49:55.200,0:49:59.280
you don’t have to go to school sometimes, 
right? So it was like, “Whatever, it’s 

0:49:59.280,0:50:02.900
Saturday,” sometimes I’m just in the living 
room, sleeping on the couch ‘cause five 

0:50:02.900,0:50:06.960
year olds want to sleep on the couch 
sometimes, and I look at the TV and it’s like, 

0:50:06.960,0:50:08.880
“Oh! What’s this? It’s about video games,  

0:50:08.880,0:50:12.000
man I wish I knew what video game
this was, I would play it.”

0:50:12.000,0:50:12.672
[Baaulp, Trog, and Wayne laugh]

0:50:12.672,0:50:16.080
Gir: I will say because my 
parents didn’t really pay too 

0:50:16.080,0:50:20.880
much attention or really care all too 
much what I was watching on TV, as like a 

0:50:20.880,0:50:23.700
six or seven-year-old I was watching South Park.

0:50:23.700,0:50:27.180
Baaulp: When I was a kid, the 
thing that I always tried to 

0:50:27.180,0:50:30.540
stay up to watch but never could ‘cause I 
would always get too tired and fall asleep 

0:50:30.540,0:50:36.300
were like—I really like the 
Conan O’Brien show. But it—

0:50:36.300,0:50:36.712
Gir: You’re so weird.

0:50:36.712,0:50:40.440
Baaulp: But it came on so late 
that I like always passed out. 

0:50:40.440,0:50:47.280
Like, I would see—I remember my cousin 
showing me clips of it and like, I guess 

0:50:47.280,0:50:51.000
he had like DVDs or something and 
it was like, man, I thought it  

0:50:51.000,0:50:51.540
was really
funny.

0:50:53.220,0:50:53.700
Wayne:  

0:51:10.740,0:51:15.900
Happy Halloween! It’s time for scary questions.
Ooouuuhhhh!

0:51:15.900,0:51:21.360
[An assortment  

0:51:21.360,0:51:24.180
of scary sounds are made by the crew]

0:51:24.180,0:51:26.280
Wayne: Guys, I got hooked you gotta unhook me.

0:51:27.585,0:51:28.440
Trog and Gir: I don’t get it.

0:51:28.440,0:51:32.085
[Gir and Wayne laugh]

0:51:32.085,0:51:33.300
Wayne:  

0:51:33.300,0:51:36.660
If you want to ask us questions that 
will be answered on the Where Do We  

0:51:36.660,0:51:39.840
Begin podcast that you are listening 
to right now, there are two ways to  

0:51:39.840,0:51:44.160
do it. You can join the WayneRadioTV 
Discord server, discord.gg/wayneradiotv,  

0:51:45.060,0:51:48.360
we don’t even need some crazy URL that we 
have to put in the description anymore,  

0:51:48.360,0:51:56.400
I can say it to you right now. Or, you can email 
us at wheredowebeginqa@gmail.com, where you can  

0:51:56.400,0:52:01.200
send us questions and get—if-if you email them 
you get-you get your questions put on a pedestal.

0:52:01.200,0:52:03.480
Baaulp: They still have to be 
good, though. They still have 

0:52:03.480,0:52:04.020
to be good.

0:52:04.020,0:52:05.460
Log: And they still have to be questions.

0:52:05.460,0:52:07.440
Wayne: Yes, you still have to follow our rules.

0:52:07.440,0:52:08.160
Baaulp: I’m the  

0:52:08.160,0:52:14.520
one that checks the email account and man,
we got—you gotta-the email, the few emails we get,  

0:52:14.520,0:52:16.140
they gotta be better. Just
sayin’.

0:52:16.140,0:52:20.280
Trog: I feel like we may have 
actually answered this before 

0:52:20.280,0:52:25.080
on the podcast, so stop me if we’ve 
already done this one, ‘cause I literally 

0:52:25.080,0:52:29.220
all-all memories of the podcast leave 
my brain as soon as we stop recording, 

0:52:29.220,0:52:34.260
but we have a question here from Blue 
who says, “If you were a clown, what 

0:52:34.260,0:52:37.140
would your clown name be and 
what’s your special trick?”

0:52:37.140,0:52:39.180
Wayne: Well we definitely 
haven’t answered that before.

0:52:39.180,0:52:40.560
Baaulp: Yeah, I think that one’s new.

0:52:40.560,0:52:44.160
Wayne: I already answered both 
these questions—parts of this 

0:52:44.160,0:52:47.640
question on my stream last night, my 
clown name would be PenisFuck and I  

0:52:47.640,0:52:48.240
would have
a monkey.

0:52:48.240,0:52:50.760
Gir: That would be your special 
trick? Is have a monkey?

0:52:50.760,0:52:51.480
Baaulp: I mean that counts, yeah.

0:52:51.480,0:52:53.250
Wayne: I’m a monkey clown.

0:52:53.250,0:52:55.560
Trog: Your trick can’t just be, “Has a monkey.”

0:52:55.560,0:52:57.480
Wayne: Well no, I have a monkey clown and I  

0:52:57.480,0:52:58.050
do tricks with a
monkey.

0:52:58.050,0:52:58.073
Trog: Yeah, what is it?

0:52:58.073,0:52:59.580
Wayne: Like we juggle together, and I make him  

0:52:59.580,0:53:00.151
do dances. And
I—He—

0:53:00.151,0:53:03.360
Trog: What’s your-what’s 
your—Okay, you-you are PenisFuck 

0:53:03.360,0:53:07.980
the monkey clown. What is your grand finale 
trick that like, leaves everyone stunned?

0:53:07.980,0:53:11.340
Wayne: Uh, the monkey pretends to murder me.

0:53:11.340,0:53:17.100
[Trog and  

0:53:17.100,0:53:18.895
Baaulp laugh]

0:53:18.895,0:53:19.020
Gir: Alright!

0:53:19.020,0:53:22.260
Wayne: We got-we got-we got 
like squibs-we got like squibs 

0:53:22.260,0:53:26.520
and everything. Like he bites my neck, 
and I’m wearing like a big clown collar, 

0:53:26.520,0:53:29.340
right? But he bites the neck and the 
squibs under there and it fuckin’ explodes.

0:53:29.340,0:53:31.560
Baaulp: A big-a big clown collar?

0:53:31.560,0:53:33.780
Wayne: Yeah! You know what 
a clown collar looks like!

0:53:33.780,0:53:37.576
Trog: This is like a setup for 
a CSI episode where it’s like—

0:53:37.576,0:53:37.614
Baaulp: The monkey actually kills you!

0:53:37.614,0:53:40.740
Trog: —“Oh yeah, this clown 
always did a trick where he gave 

0:53:40.740,0:53:45.000
his monkey a gun with blanks in it, but 
this time somebody replaced the blanks 

0:53:45.000,0:53:46.140
with real bullets.”

0:53:46.140,0:53:49.080
Wayne: That is also great. 
A monkey with a gun full of 

0:53:49.080,0:53:52.644
blanks is like the funniest 
thing a man could think of, like—

0:53:52.644,0:53:52.673
[Trog, Baaulp, and Gir laugh]

0:53:52.673,0:53:57.000
Wayne: Now if you could arrange that—that 
that gun could have infinite blanks somehow,  

0:53:57.000,0:54:02.100
that would be amazing. Just a fuckin’ 
macaque runnin’ around your town like,  

0:54:02.100,0:54:07.320
trying to do monkey run-bys on people, and 
like—Oh man, it’d be so good, so funny.

0:54:07.320,0:54:12.420
Gir: Alright, my clown name is 
uh, the children all scream. 

0:54:14.220,0:54:16.380
If they want to address me, all 
the children have to scream.

0:54:16.380,0:54:18.480
Trog: Ah, I see, so it’s sort of like—

0:54:18.480,0:54:19.140
Gir: Okay?

0:54:19.140,0:54:21.900
Trog: —less of something that 
you can write down and more of 

0:54:21.900,0:54:22.740
like, a vibe.

0:54:22.740,0:54:27.000
Gir: Yeah, and then my special 
trick is if the parents want 

0:54:27.000,0:54:28.680
the kids to stop screaming, 
they have to pay extra.

0:54:28.680,0:54:30.098
Trog: That’s a pretty good trick.

0:54:30.098,0:54:31.800
Wayne: That’s not a trick-that’s 
not pretty—that’s not very 

0:54:31.800,0:54:34.140
funny, that’s not very funny for like, a clown.

0:54:34.140,0:54:36.600
Trog: No, it’s not a funny 
trick, but it is a-it is a—

0:54:36.600,0:54:38.220
Gir: Nobody said the clown had to be funny.

0:54:38.220,0:54:39.540
Wayne: It’s a lucrative—

0:54:39.540,0:54:40.274
Trog: It’s a lucrative trick.

0:54:40.274,0:54:40.313
Gir: [Laughs] It’s a lucrative trick.

0:54:40.313,0:54:43.500
Wayne: Why would anybody hire 
this clown? Shouldn’t—Aren’t 

0:54:43.500,0:54:44.914
you supposed to disclose that kind of stuff.

0:54:44.914,0:54:45.692
Trog: [Crosstalk] Because they don’t know.

0:54:45.692,0:54:45.715
Gir: They don’t know.

0:54:45.715,0:54:47.580
Log: You can’t advertise as this clown,  

0:54:47.580,0:54:48.360
so it doesn’t
matter.

0:54:48.360,0:54:51.780
Wayne: I almost feel like any parent 
that’s getting their kid a clown for  

0:54:51.780,0:54:53.792
their birthday party isn’t gonna check 
shit, like they just need a clown.

0:54:53.792,0:54:53.815
Gir: No, yeah, exactly.

0:54:53.815,0:54:59.040
Log: I got a clown name last 
night, too. Uh, I’m PenMaster 

0:54:59.040,0:55:04.500
and I would do like, magic tricks with 
drawings. So they’d give me big easel and 

0:55:04.500,0:55:08.160
you can draw pictures on the page and 
it’d probably have a little trick in it 

0:55:08.160,0:55:09.660
that lets you move the paper.

0:55:09.660,0:55:11.760
Wayne: That actually—that’d be pretty cool.

0:55:11.760,0:55:12.780
Log: There’s probably  

0:55:12.780,0:55:17.100
a clown that does that already. Probably.
But I’m just guessin’ off the top of my head.

0:55:17.100,0:55:17.676
Wayne: Mhmm.

0:55:17.676,0:55:17.688
Trog: Uhh—

0:55:17.688,0:55:18.660
Wayne: They call him The Magic Pens.

0:55:18.660,0:55:21.600
Trog: I couldn’t come up with 
a good answer off the top of 

0:55:21.600,0:55:25.740
my head, so whenever I don’t know how 
to answer a question like this, my first 

0:55:25.740,0:55:32.280
thing is always to turn to software to 
help me. So I opened up AI Dungeon and I 

0:55:32.280,0:55:37.260
said, “You are a clown named—” and it 
said, “You are a clown named The Clown.” 

0:55:38.700,0:55:39.641
So that’s it.

0:55:39.641,0:55:39.655
[Wayne laughs]

0:55:39.655,0:55:42.540
Log: You are a clown named Software.

0:55:42.540,0:55:48.480
Wayne: I mean, hey, I think if that’s your 
name, like, you-you draw two traits. You’re  

0:55:48.480,0:55:53.580
not memorable, but you have some balls. Like, 
you have the balls to name yourself like,  

0:55:53.580,0:55:58.848
“Yeah, I’m The Clown. I am the 
titular, singular, specific clown.”

0:55:58.848,0:56:02.880
Trog: Yeah. I am The Clown. 
And uh, my special trick is…

0:56:02.880,0:56:04.140
Wayne: Got that air of confidence.

0:56:04.140,0:56:07.020
Trog: My special trick is…  

0:56:07.680,0:56:10.800
I throw a pie in your face and
your pants fall down.

0:56:10.800,0:56:11.567
[Wayne laughs]

0:56:11.567,0:56:12.991
Baaulp: That’s not nice!

0:56:12.991,0:56:14.040
Trog: No, it’s not.

0:56:14.040,0:56:15.780
Wayne: There’s like a-like 
a—What are those call-what are 

0:56:15.780,0:56:19.800
they called, bolas? There’s like fuckin’ 
bolas that swing at your pants along 

0:56:19.800,0:56:21.180
with the pie and pull them down.

0:56:21.180,0:56:23.700
Gir: Trog I love that like—You say that like  

0:56:23.700,0:56:26.844
it’s guaranteed to make your 
pants fall down every time.

0:56:26.844,0:56:28.080
Trog: Oh, yeah. That’s why it’s 
like—It’s the special trick.

0:56:28.080,0:56:29.700
Gir: That’s why it’s a special trick, yeah.

0:56:29.700,0:56:32.280
Trog: Yeah. It makes your 
pants fall down no matter what.

0:56:32.280,0:56:35.400
Gir: “What the fuck? I had a 
belt on!” “What the hell, I was 

0:56:35.400,0:56:38.400
wearing suspenders!” “What the 
hell, I wasn’t even wearing pants!”

0:56:38.400,0:56:40.560
Wayne: Makes your pants 
disappear. I mean, then we’re in 

0:56:40.560,0:56:45.149
more of like, magician territory 
than clown. When you affect others.

0:56:45.149,0:56:47.880
Baaulp: My… clown name would 
be-would be—I think-I think I 

0:56:47.880,0:56:51.420
would use the one from last 
night. Flower Squirt, and—

0:56:51.420,0:56:51.828
Gir: You have a flower that squirts.

0:56:51.828,0:56:56.321
Baaulp: My trick is I have Spiderman web shooters.

0:56:56.321,0:56:56.335
[Wayne laughs]

0:56:56.335,0:56:57.869
Gir: Are they shaped like flowers?

0:56:57.869,0:56:57.894
Baaulp: No—I mean, yes.

0:56:57.894,0:56:59.340
Trog: What do you do with them?

0:56:59.340,0:57:01.740
Wayne: I mean the joke is that 
he’s just more like Spiderman 

0:57:01.740,0:57:04.080
than a clown, and it’s not quite right, so—

0:57:04.080,0:57:04.481
Trog: [Laughs] Yeah.

0:57:04.481,0:57:04.493
[Gir laughs]

0:57:04.493,0:57:05.640
Wayne: It’s very funny.

0:57:05.640,0:57:09.000
Gir: I do like the idea of someone 
coming to like, a party like, 

0:57:09.000,0:57:11.345
“Hey, I’m the clown!” And they’re just 
completely dressed like Spiderman.

0:57:11.345,0:57:11.360
[Baaulp laughs]

0:57:11.360,0:57:15.150
Wayne: That’s a good—That is 
actually a good clown bit.

0:57:15.150,0:57:17.370
Trog: They don’t know what 
a clown or Spiderman is.

0:57:17.370,0:57:19.740
Wayne: That element would 
confuse the kids, but it’d be 

0:57:19.740,0:57:20.580
funny for the parents.

0:57:20.580,0:57:21.000
Trog: Yeah.

0:57:21.000,0:57:24.060
Gir: “Why are you dressed like 
Spiderman?” “Oh, ‘cause it’s 

0:57:24.060,0:57:25.020
funny, I’m a clown!”

0:57:25.020,0:57:27.720
Wayne: “I’m sort of like a high 
concept, like avantgarde, absurdist 

0:57:27.720,0:57:30.000
clown, like I’m gonna do some things that 
are going to make you guys laugh, your 

0:57:30.000,0:57:32.010
kids don’t know what the fuck’s 
gonna go on, like-you’re gonna—”

0:57:32.010,0:57:34.080
Gir: “Listen to your kid, I’m the people’s clown,  

0:57:34.080,0:57:35.400
I do what’s
funny to me.”

0:57:35.400,0:57:37.620
Wayne: No, then you’re not the people’s clown.

0:57:37.620,0:57:39.480
Log: I’m an open source clown.

0:57:39.480,0:57:41.805
Wayne: You have a selfish-you’re a selfish clown.

0:57:41.805,0:57:42.960
Gir, laughing: Shut up, kid!

0:57:42.960,0:57:44.460
Wayne: I’m twenty-fwive.

0:57:44.460,0:57:47.773
Log: If you upload it to GitHub I’ll do ‘em.

0:57:47.773,0:57:47.786
[Trog laughs]

0:57:47.786,0:57:47.804
Gir: Twenty-fwive!

0:57:47.804,0:57:50.520
Wayne: [Laughs] I’m also not twenty-five,  

0:57:50.520,0:57:52.000
I don’t know why I
like—

0:57:52.000,0:57:55.200
Trog, laughing: You just—That 
is like, entirely incorrect.

0:57:55.200,0:58:00.840
Wayne: It’s like-it’s incorrect, but just slightly 
incorrect enough that it doesn’t make any sense.  

0:58:00.840,0:58:04.620
Like, it’s not like I said like I’m forty, 
I’m not doing a joke like I’m older than I am.  

0:58:05.280,0:58:07.560
It’s just wrong, like my brain failed.

0:58:07.560,0:58:12.660
Trog: Uh, we have a question here 
from Discord user, ArthurLovesYou,  

0:58:12.660,0:58:17.340
who says, “If you absolutely had to 
get a tattoo, what would you get?”

0:58:17.340,0:58:20.760
Wayne: I thought about this 
many times. Because the concept 

0:58:20.760,0:58:24.930
of a tattoo I love, but I don’t know 
what the fuck—I can’t never decide.

0:58:24.930,0:58:26.880
Trog: It’s a really daunting decision.

0:58:26.880,0:58:33.420
Baaulp: This is why I don’t have a tattoo now, 
because like-like ever since like—Y’know I feel  

0:58:33.420,0:58:38.100
like the idea of tattoos being cool kinda starts 
to creep in in high school. Like high school is  

0:58:38.100,0:58:44.640
when I remember my friends going like, “Yeah, 
what if I got a tattoo?” And that just like,  

0:58:44.640,0:58:50.040
is a concept to you now. But like, I think 
about it—I’m like, I like a lot of things,  

0:58:50.040,0:58:58.800
there’s nothing I like that much that I would 
throw down money for an artist to etch on my body.

0:58:58.800,0:58:59.760
Gir: It’s true.

0:58:59.760,0:59:01.894
Baaulp: Y’know-you know what 
I mean? Like, I like Pokem—

0:59:01.894,0:59:02.505
Gir: That’s exactly how I feel.

0:59:02.505,0:59:03.120
Baaulp: For example,  

0:59:04.080,0:59:08.400
um, there’s a kid that really liked
sailing, and so they had like a  

0:59:08.400,0:59:12.720
sailing sextant tattooed—They were like, “Ooh,
what if I got a sextant tattooed on me,” I’m like,  

0:59:13.380,0:59:17.520
I don’t think I—Y’know. Or I
met a guy who like, really liked  

0:59:17.520,0:59:22.020
Pokemon, so they had Squirtle tattooed on
them, y’know? It’s like y’know, whatever,  

0:59:22.020,0:59:25.800
y’know, like some people are so
casual about it, but I’m here like,  

0:59:26.400,0:59:30.900
I would not do that! Like, I like so many
things but there’s nothing that I—

0:59:30.900,0:59:32.650
Wayne: Baaulp. I’ve got you 
pinned, I’ve got you cornered.

0:59:32.650,0:59:32.693
Baaulp: What would I get? What would I get?

0:59:32.693,0:59:34.680
Wayne: You would get a tattoo of the Cupman from  

0:59:34.680,0:59:35.700
Neverwinter
Nights.

0:59:36.560,0:59:40.260
Baaulp: …No! I don’t want that etched on my  

0:59:40.260,0:59:41.733
body! Here’s the
thing, like—

0:59:41.733,0:59:41.755
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

0:59:41.755,0:59:44.220
Gir: Yeah, what are you talking 
about? He likes that, but—

0:59:44.220,0:59:49.320
Baaulp: Would I—Okay, would I 
get Cupman on a shirt? Yes. Would 

0:59:49.320,0:59:53.400
I get Cupman on a cake and then eat it? Yes.

0:59:53.400,0:59:55.980
Wayne: Yakuza-style back tattoo of the Cupman.  

0:59:55.980,0:59:57.180
Full back
tattoo.

0:59:57.180,0:59:58.260
Baaulp: Would I get like,  

0:59:58.260,1:00:05.220
a Cupman—Would I get a Cupman
decal on my car? Yes. But I would not get Cupman  

1:00:05.220,1:00:06.893
etched on my body ‘cause that
seems stupid.

1:00:06.893,1:00:09.780
Wayne: What if it’s like extremely 
funny and not public facing? 

1:00:09.780,1:00:13.260
Like, would you get a Cupman tattoo 
on your ass that no one sees? But  

1:00:13.260,1:00:14.100
you can
say that.

1:00:14.100,1:00:16.074
Gir: That would be kind of 
funny, actually [laughs].

1:00:16.074,1:00:19.920
Trog: But then if somebody does see it, 
it’s going to be even more confusing.

1:00:19.920,1:00:23.460
Baaulp: I still-I still wouldn’t 
want that. I still wouldn’t 

1:00:23.460,1:00:24.060
want that.

1:00:24.060,1:00:27.060
Trog: Can I suggest another 
one for you, Baaulp? Because 

1:00:27.060,1:00:31.200
whenever Wayne started suggesting a tattoo 
I thought he was going to take it in 

1:00:31.200,1:00:34.020
this direction. I think you should 
just get a chicken wing somewhere.

1:00:34.020,1:00:35.421
Baaulp: Uhhh… I don’t know…

1:00:35.421,1:00:35.799
Trog: You do love chicken wings.

1:00:35.798,1:00:39.840
Wayne: See, you run the risk—You 
have to have this balance 

1:00:39.840,1:00:43.320
of both importance and also like, 
the fact that it would look good.

1:00:43.320,1:00:46.560
Trog: And also that it’s on 
you until you want to get it 

1:00:46.560,1:00:47.310
painfully removed.

1:00:47.310,1:00:50.100
Wayne: You don’t want to be 
like that one redhead dude that 

1:00:50.100,1:00:54.180
I can’t remember the name of—I think his 
name’s like—Ed Markey’s what’s coming 

1:00:54.180,1:00:58.260
to my head, but I kn—That’s the politician. 
The fuckin’-the fuckin’ annoying 

1:00:58.260,1:01:02.880
singer who has a fucking like Heinz 
ketchup bottle tattooed on his arm, like 

1:01:02.880,1:01:03.840
you don’t want to end up like that.

1:01:03.840,1:01:06.180
Trog: That’s some Coach McGuirk shit.

1:01:06.180,1:01:07.800
Wayne: What is his name? You know his name.

1:01:07.800,1:01:08.736
Trog: I have no idea who you’re talking about.

1:01:08.736,1:01:11.400
Wayne: The redhead guy! The redhead 
guy who looks a little goofy.

1:01:11.400,1:01:12.173
Baaulp: The guy!

1:01:12.173,1:01:13.380
Wayne: And he makes boring music.

1:01:13.380,1:01:14.392
Trog: What are you talking about?

1:01:14.392,1:01:16.140
Baaulp: That’s a lot of people, bro.

1:01:16.140,1:01:20.940
Trog: The redhead—Oh, oh! 
Fuck, no, I know who you’re 

1:01:20.940,1:01:23.250
talking about, but I don’t know 
his name, either. It’s a musician.

1:01:23.250,1:01:24.883
Wayne: Why the fuck can’t we remember who this is?

1:01:24.883,1:01:25.920
Baaulp: ‘Cause we don’t listen to pop!

1:01:25.920,1:01:26.820
Gir: He’s unmemorable!

1:01:26.820,1:01:29.750
Trog: I don’t know—Is it Ed 
Sheeran? Is it Ed Sheeran?

1:01:29.750,1:01:31.588
Wayne: Ed Sheer—[Claps once] 
It is Ed Sheeran, you got it.

1:01:31.588,1:01:31.613
Trog: That’s who it is.

1:01:31.613,1:01:34.080
Wayne: I don’t know why-I 
couldn’t think anything but Ed 

1:01:34.080,1:01:36.120
Markey, and I know who Ed Markey is.

1:01:36.120,1:01:38.880
Trog: Yeah, Ed Sheeran has a 
fucking ketchup bottle tattooed 

1:01:38.880,1:01:40.772
on like he’s Coach McGuirk from Home Movies.

1:01:40.772,1:01:40.793
[Wayne and Log laugh]

1:01:40.793,1:01:47.880
Wayne: Honestly, getting a 
BabyBel cheese cow tattoo would 

1:01:47.880,1:01:49.748
be like, a fucking great tattoo.

1:01:49.748,1:01:49.764
[Baaulp laughs]

1:01:49.764,1:01:49.793
Trog: Gotta love that cheese.

1:01:49.793,1:01:51.720
Wayne: I’m not even-I’m not even the  

1:01:51.720,1:01:53.580
biggest Home Movies fan,
and that would be great.

1:01:53.580,1:01:56.100
Trog: I’m sure so many people have that, like—

1:01:56.100,1:02:00.060
Wayne: Unlike-unlike Baaulp, who said like, 
Baaulp was like, “ I don’t really like-I don’t  

1:02:00.060,1:02:07.500
love a piece of media enough to like, engrave 
that onto me,” I am an independent being who  

1:02:07.500,1:02:13.860
thinks for themselves, and is understanding of 
like the downsides of media and what they play  

1:02:13.860,1:02:21.120
in our lives. However, I do love myself some 
media. But I am of the concern of like, if  

1:02:21.120,1:02:25.260
you’re gonna get a tattoo from like a video game 
or a movie or an anime or something like that,  

1:02:25.260,1:02:30.900
it cannot be like, super easily recognizable 
because then it’s like-it just fuckin’ blows.  

1:02:30.900,1:02:36.060
Like-like I would not get a tattoo of just 
like, a picture of Goku on my arm, although—

1:02:36.060,1:02:37.740
Trog: So you’d get the Triforce, right?

1:02:37.740,1:02:40.560
Wayne: Saying that out loud, 
that would be pretty funny. Like, 

1:02:40.560,1:02:44.940
just Goku. Just concept art of 
Goku like, the basic reference art.

1:02:44.940,1:02:46.260
Trog: That’d be an expensive tattoo.

1:02:46.260,1:02:49.500
Wayne: Yeah. For me, if it’s a 
reference to something, like, 

1:02:49.500,1:02:54.720
it has to be very cool in itself, and 
I’ve only ever had one idea that I’ve 

1:02:54.720,1:02:59.640
been like, close to doing, but the thing 
that holds me back is that like, it is 

1:02:59.640,1:03:03.900
too elaborate and I feel like it could 
get fucked up and not be good. I think a 

1:03:03.900,1:03:08.100
really cool tattoo from an anime would 
be Scar’s destruction arm from Full 

1:03:08.100,1:03:11.004
Metal Alchemist: Brotherhood, 
like the engravings on his arm.

1:03:11.004,1:03:11.033
Trog: That’d be cool. Yeah.

1:03:11.033,1:03:13.980
Wayne: Yeah, like that would 
be sick. But the two things I 

1:03:13.980,1:03:17.100
need in order to pull that off: I need 
to find a really good tattoo artist, and 

1:03:17.100,1:03:19.560
I need to get buff. I-I don’t 
earn it if I’m not buff.

1:03:19.560,1:03:22.560
Trog: And you have to always 
wear a cloak so that like, you 

1:03:22.560,1:03:24.660
can whip it out and threaten people with it.

1:03:24.660,1:03:26.760
Wayne: And I have to kill 
any alchemists that I see.

1:03:26.760,1:03:27.584
Trog: Yeah.

1:03:27.584,1:03:30.240
Wayne: [Laughs] I have to kill all alchemists.

1:03:30.240,1:03:32.520
Trog: You have to be really threatening with it.

1:03:32.520,1:03:36.720
Gir: I’ve thought about it before, ‘cause I could 
literally get one tomorrow if I wanted because my,  

1:03:36.720,1:03:43.860
uh, my mom is like a tart—tartoo—tattoo 
artist, and I think if anything—‘Cause  

1:03:43.860,1:03:47.700
I’m with Baaulp, there’s nothing that I
really like enough that I want-I want it  

1:03:47.700,1:03:51.270
etched onto my body—but I think I would 
probably get the Turtle School symbol.

1:03:51.270,1:03:52.560
Trog: Not a bad one.

1:03:52.560,1:03:54.900
Wayne: Where? On your chest or on your back?

1:03:54.900,1:03:58.620
Gir: No—Like, on my back, 
on my shoulder blade, maybe.

1:03:58.620,1:03:59.760
Wayne: Like a full back size?

1:03:59.760,1:04:00.810
Trog: On both of my palms.

1:04:00.810,1:04:03.300
Gir: No, no! On my shoulder blade!

1:04:03.300,1:04:04.080
Wayne: Oh.

1:04:04.080,1:04:05.220
Baaulp: Are you sure you wouldn’t  

1:04:05.220,1:04:06.897
want a third eye on your
forehead like Tien [laughs]?

1:04:06.897,1:04:06.931
Trog: [Laughs] That would be sick.

1:04:06.931,1:04:12.600
Wayne: Now that’d be dope. 
That would be sick. You will 

1:04:12.600,1:04:15.330
actually be able to do Tri-Beams 
if you do that. Just so you know.

1:04:15.330,1:04:18.120
Trog: Yeah, nobody’s ever 
tried it before because they’re 

1:04:18.120,1:04:18.720
too scared.

1:04:18.720,1:04:19.074
[Wayne laughs]

1:04:19.074,1:04:21.420
Log: Maybe you should tattoo your skin green.

1:04:21.420,1:04:23.204
Trog: Just like Piccolo.

1:04:23.204,1:04:23.212
Gir: No.

1:04:23.212,1:04:24.480
Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

1:04:24.480,1:04:28.200
Gir: ‘Cause I knew a guy, he 
used to work at the place I 

1:04:28.200,1:04:33.420
worked, uh, but he would still come 
in a lot, and he had-he had one arm 

1:04:33.420,1:04:36.035
completely dedicated to Halo tattoos.

1:04:36.035,1:04:36.053
Baaulp: Oh my god.

1:04:36.053,1:04:40.080
Wayne: That’s fuckin’ sick. 
That-that is so lame and so sick 

1:04:40.080,1:04:40.795
at the same time. I love that.

1:04:40.795,1:04:43.080
Gir: It was pretty cool. If 
it was lame I wouldn’t have 

1:04:43.080,1:04:46.380
brought it up, but he had like 
a big ass energy sword on there,  

1:04:46.380,1:04:47.370
he had like the
legendary—

1:04:47.370,1:04:48.960
Wayne: It’s lame in the good way.

1:04:49.560,1:04:50.052
Gir: Mhmm.

1:04:50.052,1:04:52.140
Wayne: Like, that’s so cheesy. I love it.

1:04:52.140,1:04:55.140
Baaulp: For me it’s about 
execution. Like if the art is 

1:04:55.140,1:04:56.340
legitimately good—

1:04:56.340,1:04:56.795
Gir: It was good art.

1:04:56.795,1:05:00.060
Baaulp: —and if-if-if it’s like your  

1:05:00.060,1:05:03.089
full arm, then it wraps
around to being cool.

1:05:03.089,1:05:03.660
Gir: It was the full arm, too. Yeah.  

1:05:03.660,1:05:06.180
It was the full arm, he
had like a big ass Master Chief  

1:05:06.180,1:05:10.680
on there, he had like the legendary difficulty
logo, he had like, he had all kinds of shit on  

1:05:10.680,1:05:11.880
there, it was pretty tight,
actually.

1:05:11.880,1:05:15.000
Wayne: There’s another kind of 
tattoo that I would want but 

1:05:15.000,1:05:17.280
I can’t get because it’s not okay—Like,  

1:05:17.280,1:05:22.200
a genuine yakuza-style back tattoo
would be fucking awesome, but like,  

1:05:22.200,1:05:27.042
it’s not good to do that, like, for
multiple reasons why you can’t do that.

1:05:27.042,1:05:27.055
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:05:27.055,1:05:29.340
Gir: You can’t-you can’t 
visit Japan if you do that.

1:05:29.340,1:05:31.740
Log: Yeah, you’d get—You’d get into a battle.

1:05:31.740,1:05:34.740
Wayne: You can’t visit Japan, 
that-that means bad things in 

1:05:34.740,1:05:40.920
Japan, and also like, it is-I think 
it is appropriation, in a way, the-you 

1:05:40.920,1:05:44.280
shouldn’t do that. But it looks so 
cool. Those fuckin’-those fucking 

1:05:44.280,1:05:46.855
flowing back tattoos onto 
the arms are so fucking sick.

1:05:46.855,1:05:49.080
Log: The street thugs would get at you if you  

1:05:49.080,1:05:49.860
were wearing
that tattoo.

1:05:49.860,1:05:52.500
Wayne: Every—Yeah, every 
five minutes walking down the 

1:05:52.500,1:05:56.040
street four men in suits would come out 
and try to—They would challenge me to a 

1:05:56.040,1:05:58.320
fight, and they would take turns 
throwing punches at me in a circle.

1:05:58.320,1:06:01.200
Baaulp: And then a giant 
eight-foot man would like,  

1:06:01.200,1:06:02.204
slam you
on the ground.

1:06:02.204,1:06:04.260
Wayne: [Laughs] Rips all 
the money out of your pants.

1:06:04.260,1:06:06.120
Baaulp: Yeah, all the money 
in your checking account  

1:06:06.120,1:06:06.761
would
disappear.

1:06:06.761,1:06:06.775
[Wayne laughs]

1:06:06.775,1:06:10.500
Log: Yeah, I wouldn’t really 
want a tattoo. I think if I had 

1:06:10.500,1:06:14.940
to get one I’d want one that would 
look like just a weird-like an abstract 

1:06:14.940,1:06:20.760
photoshop project. Like, just take 
standard images but have them to where it 

1:06:20.760,1:06:24.060
looks like they’re just like 
cleanly separated, y’know? Like,  

1:06:24.840,1:06:26.084
y’know what I’m
talking about?

1:06:26.084,1:06:26.092
Gir: No.

1:06:26.092,1:06:28.230
Baaulp: Yeah, like you want something abstract—

1:06:28.230,1:06:31.320
Log: The box will—Like Box 
Select like part of it, and then 

1:06:31.320,1:06:35.520
like, move it away so that it’s 
like the full thing is there but  

1:06:35.520,1:06:36.271
it’s like
separated.

1:06:36.271,1:06:36.295
Gir: That could be cool.

1:06:36.295,1:06:39.480
Log: I feel like that could 
be—I feel like that could look 

1:06:39.480,1:06:40.140
kinda cool.

1:06:40.140,1:06:40.700
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:06:40.700,1:06:45.420
Log: Uh, either that or just 
like-like a shitty rubber boot 

1:06:45.420,1:06:49.962
that you would get by fishing 
in a river or something.

1:06:49.962,1:06:49.975
[Trog laughs]

1:06:49.975,1:06:52.560
Log: But just like the line 
art of it, and really small.

1:06:52.560,1:06:55.320
Gir: I think like a little 
rubber boot on like a hook and 

1:06:55.320,1:06:55.860
line could be—

1:06:55.860,1:06:58.380
Log: Nah, no hook and line, just like a boot.

1:06:58.380,1:07:00.720
Gir: Just a shit boot? Would you like, put that on  

1:07:00.720,1:07:01.380
like your
ankle?

1:07:01.380,1:07:02.700
Log: Nah, just anywhere.

1:07:02.700,1:07:04.260
Gir: On your palm.

1:07:04.260,1:07:05.383
Log: Yeah.

1:07:05.383,1:07:05.395
[Gir laughs]

1:07:05.395,1:07:08.220
Log: Put a boot on my palm.

1:07:08.220,1:07:12.300
Baaulp: [Sighs] I-I 
legitimately—Okay, the one thing I can 

1:07:12.300,1:07:19.320
think of, like—The way I see tattoos is 
like, you gotta really—It’s gotta like 

1:07:19.320,1:07:22.020
really mean something to you. It’s gotta be—

1:07:22.020,1:07:22.440
Gir: Oh!

1:07:22.440,1:07:26.400
Baaulp: It’s gotta like 
really, really mean something 

1:07:26.400,1:07:27.600
to you, y’know what I mean? Like—

1:07:27.600,1:07:28.740
Gir: Yeah, I-I actually—

1:07:28.740,1:07:30.300
Baaulp: I’ve always grown 
up thinking about that—What?

1:07:30.300,1:07:32.625
Gir: I have a suggestion for you, Trog.

1:07:32.625,1:07:34.140
Trog: [Laughs] Sure, what is it.

1:07:34.140,1:07:36.060
Gir: Uh, Marshie the Marshmallow.

1:07:36.060,1:07:38.191
Trog: Oh my god, no, that’s-that would be…

1:07:38.191,1:07:38.213
[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

1:07:38.213,1:07:42.180
Wayne: A Homestar Runner tattoo 
would be pretty good. I’d 

1:07:42.180,1:07:44.700
definitely get a Homestar tattoo 
if I could think of the right one.

1:07:44.700,1:07:49.500
Trog: I’m-I’m with Log in that 
I do not ever foresee myself 

1:07:49.500,1:07:54.600
ever getting a tattoo. Part 
of that comes from my uh,  

1:07:54.600,1:07:56.363
incredible fear of
needles, but—

1:07:56.363,1:07:56.380
Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

1:07:56.380,1:07:56.394
[Wayne laughs]

1:07:56.394,1:08:01.380
Trog: —the other part of it comes from 
the fact that I-I legitimately like—I  

1:08:02.160,1:08:08.539
mean, I like a lot of media, but I don’t know if I 
like anything, anything, enough to like permanent—

1:08:08.539,1:08:08.574
Baaulp: Yeah, that’s the thing—

1:08:08.574,1:08:10.620
Trog: —well, not permanent, 
but y’know like, essentially 

1:08:10.620,1:08:15.586
permanently add it to me. 
Like it becomes part of me.

1:08:15.586,1:08:18.720
Baaulp: Yeah. That’s exactly 
like—I’ll buy it, I’ll buy a 

1:08:18.720,1:08:21.960
poster, I’ll frame it, I’ll have the 
art in my home, I’ll buy-I’ll play the 

1:08:21.960,1:08:27.240
game, I’ll buy—I’ll eat fuckin’-I’ll 
eat the fuckin’ fruit snacks! But like, 

1:08:28.020,1:08:33.180
you-If you’re like, “Okay, etch this 
onto your skin,” that like, crosses some 

1:08:33.180,1:08:39.060
line in my head where it’s like, “No, 
I don’t want something like that,” 

1:08:39.060,1:08:43.740
y’know. And like it being permanent has 
nothing to do with it, right? ‘Cause if 

1:08:43.740,1:08:47.640
I’m buying a poster I want it in my 
home, but it’s like, it being on my skin 

1:08:47.640,1:08:49.140
it’s like-I don’t need it to go that far.

1:08:49.140,1:08:55.140
Trog: I would-so I would get—So if I was 
forced to and I can’t just pick like a  

1:08:55.140,1:09:00.300
cop-out like, “Oh I get a dot on my ankle,” 
or whatever, like it has to be a real tattoo,  

1:09:00.300,1:09:07.355
I wanna go all in and I just wanna get the exact 
tattoos from the movie Memento all over my body—

1:09:07.355,1:09:07.374
Baaulp: Ohhhh fuck.

1:09:07.374,1:09:12.600
Trog: —so that I can walk around 
in public and then pretend 

1:09:12.600,1:09:16.440
to have amnesia and start freaking out 
and then take my clothes off and look at 

1:09:16.440,1:09:18.060
all of my tattoos and then calm down.

1:09:18.060,1:09:18.720
Baaulp: Nice.

1:09:18.720,1:09:21.660
Gir: Consider this about your 
fear of needles, uh, that 

1:09:21.660,1:09:23.580
needle stabs you so fast you can’t even see it.

1:09:23.580,1:09:23.940
Trog: I know.

1:09:23.940,1:09:24.900
Wayne: Invisible needles.

1:09:24.900,1:09:27.180
Trog: No, legitimately I just 
wouldn’t want to get a tattoo 

1:09:27.180,1:09:29.700
because I just can’t think of 
anything good enough. If I can  

1:09:29.700,1:09:30.420
think of something
good enough—

1:09:30.420,1:09:32.740
Wayne: The Covid vaccine will be invisible!

1:09:32.740,1:09:32.753
[Trog laughs]

1:09:32.753,1:09:35.094
Wayne: So that it doesn’t scare Trog [laughs].

1:09:35.094,1:09:39.900
Trog: If I-if I-if I could 
think of something cool enough 

1:09:39.900,1:09:44.880
that I like—Y’know, honestly, what came 
to my mind, but I probably wouldn’t do 

1:09:44.880,1:09:48.960
this because this would be like-it would 
have to be a big tattoo to work and I 

1:09:48.960,1:09:53.880
wouldn’t want like a big tattoo, is like, 
I kind of would get—maybe think about 

1:09:53.880,1:09:57.660
getting like the fucking Amiga 
Juggler somewhere on my body—

1:09:57.660,1:09:58.174
[Baaulp laughs]

1:09:58.174,1:10:01.500
Trog: —just because I feel 
like that’s like just obscure 

1:10:01.500,1:10:07.500
enough but within my realm of things I 
think are quaint and neat that like I 

1:10:07.500,1:10:10.980
could maybe see that, but that 
would be a really obscure thing  

1:10:10.980,1:10:12.240
to get tattooed
on your body.

1:10:12.240,1:10:15.060
Wayne: Y’know-y’know what would 
be a good spot for like a funny 

1:10:15.060,1:10:18.637
tattoo? Would be like right at the top 
of your spine on the back of your neck—

1:10:18.637,1:10:18.653
Trog: Oh my god.

1:10:18.653,1:10:20.640
Wayne: Like it just creeps out from  

1:10:20.640,1:10:22.069
behind a shirt collar,
so someone-someone—

1:10:22.069,1:10:23.700
Gir: Right where it would hurt the most.

1:10:23.700,1:10:26.068
Trog: I was about to say, that would hurt so bad.

1:10:26.068,1:10:26.081
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:10:26.081,1:10:28.500
Wayne: Yeah, yeah. But 
someone-someone walking behind you 

1:10:28.500,1:10:30.960
would like, just get this-the 
little juggler popping out.

1:10:30.960,1:10:32.924
Trog: Yeah, they get a little peak.

1:10:32.924,1:10:33.945
Wayne: [Laughs] Yeah.

1:10:33.945,1:10:37.800
Baaulp: I’ll give you one 
scenario I can see myself getting 

1:10:37.800,1:10:43.920
a tattoo is—And there’s like a precedent 
for this in like, I think certain 

1:10:43.920,1:10:49.860
places in Asia, I remember watching a 
video from a documentary about it, this 

1:10:49.860,1:10:56.100
like-they do this in Southeast Asia I 
think, but like, practitioners, like, if 

1:10:56.100,1:11:02.340
you’re a practitioner of a specific style 
of animal Kung Fu, like Tiger style, 

1:11:02.340,1:11:09.060
or Mantis style, you get that animal 
tattooed on you, and that’s what I’d do. 

1:11:09.060,1:11:14.700
If I was like, “I’m gonna try Tiger 
style Kung Fu,” and I like, find myself 

1:11:14.700,1:11:19.740
getting really good at it, I would get 
a tiger tattooed on me. ‘Cause then it 

1:11:19.740,1:11:23.910
wraps around to like, this means 
something. And it’s also badass.

1:11:23.910,1:11:26.640
Wayne: But it’ll never be as 
cool as a yakuza back tattoo.

1:11:26.640,1:11:29.400
Gir: No, you get-you do Snake 
style so you have like the 

1:11:29.400,1:11:31.080
snake that wraps around 
your arm and then you like—

1:11:31.080,1:11:31.710
Wayne: That is actually dope.

1:11:31.710,1:11:33.600
Gir: Have it on the side of 
your hand so you can open your 

1:11:33.600,1:11:35.100
hand and it’s like the snake opens its mouth.

1:11:35.100,1:11:37.680
Wayne: Yeah, if you have 
like—Honestly, the concept of like-like 

1:11:37.680,1:11:40.860
a snake wrapped around your back 
and it turns into your hands,  

1:11:40.860,1:11:41.820
that’s pretty
fuckin’ rad.

1:11:41.820,1:11:44.940
Baaulp: But like, that’s an 
example of the kind of devotion 

1:11:44.940,1:11:49.440
I would have to have in something for me 
to be like, “Yeah, it’s a good idea to 

1:11:49.440,1:11:53.640
get a tattoo,” like, oh I’m a 
practitioner of this martial art.

1:11:53.640,1:11:55.380
Wayne: Get a tattoo of Bob from Tekken.

1:11:55.380,1:11:56.790
Baaulp: That’s a video game!

1:11:56.790,1:11:59.820
Wayne: Yeah, but you’re a 
practitioner of that martial art 

1:11:59.820,1:12:02.820
and you’ve-you’ve dedicated thousands 
of hours of your life to playing as Bob.

1:12:02.820,1:12:04.380
Gir: You do have speed and weight.

1:12:04.380,1:12:05.970
Wayne: See? You see what I’m sayin’.

1:12:05.970,1:12:07.133
Baaulp: But that’s so lame, ugh.

1:12:07.133,1:12:10.440
Wayne: Final answer for me, 
another-another good tattoo idea 

1:12:10.440,1:12:15.000
that just requires the right word—Knuckle 
tatts with a word. I like-we’ve—Log 

1:12:15.720,1:12:19.560
had that fucking hilarious idea a long 
ass time ago where it’s like, the best 

1:12:19.560,1:12:23.160
knuckle tattoo says, “Bonus 
Fingers,” and you have extra fingers.

1:12:23.160,1:12:23.610
[Baaulp laughs]

1:12:23.610,1:12:25.500
Trog: [Laughs] Yeah, I think about that a lot.

1:12:25.500,1:12:29.340
Baaulp: Have a Tiger style—Like, 
have a tiger right next to 

1:12:29.340,1:12:32.940
your Heinz ketchup bottle to symbolize 
that you like ketchup and you’re 

1:12:32.940,1:12:34.260
a practitioner of Tiger style.

1:12:34.260,1:12:38.520
Wayne: Uh, okay, I really like 
this question from tyefyedie, 

1:12:38.520,1:12:41.880
which is, “What’s something you’ve come 
across the Internet that you’ve tried 

1:12:41.880,1:12:44.160
to find again, but have been 
unable to find it at all?”

1:12:44.160,1:12:45.400
Trog: Oooh.

1:12:45.400,1:12:47.760
Wayne: Whether it’s you just 
simply lost it, or you think it 

1:12:47.760,1:12:50.100
got removed and you can’t find any archive of it—

1:12:50.100,1:12:51.933
Gir: “Rebuild the Internet, Andy!”

1:12:51.933,1:12:51.953
Trog: That’s gone.

1:12:51.953,1:12:54.240
Wayne: That’s one, that’s our conjoined answered.

1:12:54.240,1:12:55.733
Gir: “Rebuild the Internet!”

1:12:55.733,1:13:00.660
Wayne: Our conjoined answer 
is the uh, this video of this 

1:13:00.660,1:13:07.120
man filming himself in a mirror, uh, 
he’s unkempt and bearded, and uh, he—

1:13:07.120,1:13:07.800
Gir: Shirtless.

1:13:07.800,1:13:08.610
Wayne: Was he shirtless?

1:13:08.610,1:13:09.300
Trog: Yes.

1:13:09.300,1:13:10.402
Gir: He was shirtless.

1:13:10.402,1:13:10.426
Trog: He was definitely.

1:13:10.426,1:13:12.120
Wayne: He was standing in a 
mirror filming himself and he 

1:13:12.120,1:13:16.380
was just babbling on about inventing the 
Internet and the iPhone and specifically 

1:13:16.380,1:13:22.560
he was like, “Andy, this is Steve Jobs 
talking to you! Rebuild the Internet, 

1:13:22.560,1:13:28.620
Andy! Rebuild the Internet! I bet you 
seventy-five fucking cents you cannot rebuild 

1:13:28.620,1:13:33.420
the Internet, Andy! This is Steve Jobs 
talking to you!” And he just progressively 

1:13:33.420,1:13:36.519
gets louder and louder and it 
was like one of the best videos.

1:13:36.519,1:13:36.534
[Baaulp laughs]

1:13:36.534,1:13:39.060
Trog: And nobody saved it. ‘Cause we’re stupid.

1:13:39.060,1:13:40.320
Gir: “Take the bet, kid!”

1:13:40.320,1:13:42.461
Wayne: “Take the bet!” Yeah, 
I forgot about that part.

1:13:42.461,1:13:42.473
[Gir laughs]

1:13:42.473,1:13:44.340
Wayne: The last time I brought 
this up was during the Half Life: 

1:13:44.340,1:13:46.980
Alyx stream and someone was like, “You 
just need to recreate that, Wayne,” and 

1:13:46.980,1:13:47.880
I was like, yeah-why the fuck—

1:13:47.880,1:13:48.744
Trog: It’ll never be the same.

1:13:48.744,1:13:48.760
Gir: It won’t.

1:13:48.760,1:13:48.773
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:13:48.773,1:13:51.540
Wayne: I can get pretty close. 
I mean, it won’t be the same, 

1:13:51.540,1:13:52.920
but archives the concept.

1:13:52.920,1:13:54.840
Gir: ‘Cause you’re not a lunatic talking to  

1:13:54.840,1:13:55.780
themself in a
mirror!

1:13:55.780,1:13:55.793
[Trog laughs]

1:13:55.793,1:13:58.020
Wayne: That’s the thing, is it 
loses the authenticity factor 

1:13:58.020,1:14:00.870
that that guy was saying that, fully 
believing it-whatever he was saying.

1:14:00.870,1:14:01.320
Trog: Yeah.

1:14:01.320,1:14:05.160
Baaulp: My lost media thing, 
I actually found again!

1:14:05.160,1:14:06.240
Trog: Well then it’s not lost.

1:14:06.240,1:14:08.627
Wayne: Well then it’s not-well then 
it’s not part of this question!

1:14:08.627,1:14:09.900
Baaulp: Huh, well alright…

1:14:09.900,1:14:11.100
Gir: It’s true. Sorry, Baaulp.

1:14:11.100,1:14:12.420
Wayne: You found it, you found it,  

1:14:12.420,1:14:13.157
so it’s not the right
answer.

1:14:13.157,1:14:13.193
Baaulp: Okay, alright, who’s next?

1:14:13.193,1:14:15.240
Wayne: I’m just-you can talk about it,  

1:14:15.240,1:14:17.143
but I had to drill
you on that for fun.

1:14:17.143,1:14:20.580
Baaulp: [Laughs] For the long—When I was 
a kid, y’know every kid is gonna watch  

1:14:20.580,1:14:28.740
like-that grew up in the same era as me, watched 
Flash animations, and like it was slim pickings,  

1:14:28.740,1:14:33.480
you took what you could get, and for some 
reason, this wasn’t even meant for kids,  

1:14:33.480,1:14:38.460
it was meant for adults—Not in that it was 
an adult subject matter, it was a cooking  

1:14:38.460,1:14:45.360
show. It was a cooking show that was animated 
in Flash, and not only was it a cooking show,  

1:14:45.360,1:14:51.000
it was a cooking show that was like, where the 
premise was there was a fake talk show—This was  

1:14:51.000,1:14:57.480
something that would have gone over my head 
so much, but I loved it, I love hearing about  

1:14:57.480,1:15:04.140
the merit of Old Bay Seasoning and how to use 
it for your seafood dishes, and how to deep  

1:15:04.140,1:15:09.120
fry chicken and this and that. It was like, 
what the fuck is this show. And it also like,  

1:15:09.120,1:15:18.180
was hosted by a cartoon octopus and I found it-it 
probably hasn’t aged well because it’s like what,  

1:15:18.180,1:15:26.280
a cooking show from 2005 animated in Flash 
that had like five episodes? I have no idea  

1:15:26.280,1:15:31.020
who made these or like what their end goal was 
because I can’t imagine them getting a lot of  

1:15:31.020,1:15:36.060
money out of this. It was probably like some 
kitchenware company, I don’t know, but it was  

1:15:36.060,1:15:44.880
called Deep Fried LIVE with Tako the Octopus. 
What the fuck. But I found it, so that’s cool.

1:15:44.880,1:15:47.820
Gir: I can’t think of anything 
beyond that “rebuild the  

1:15:47.820,1:15:48.320
Internet”
video.

1:15:48.320,1:15:52.440
Trog: Yeah, I don’t know. I’m 
trying to think of anything 

1:15:52.440,1:15:56.280
that I would’ve saw as a kid, but I feel 
like anything I saw as a kid, like I 

1:15:56.280,1:15:59.210
can still get it, like I can still find it.

1:15:59.210,1:16:01.020
Gir: Wait are we talking about 
as a kid or just in general?

1:16:01.020,1:16:02.100
Log: In general.

1:16:02.100,1:16:02.580
Gir: Okay.

1:16:02.580,1:16:04.200
Log: There’s a video of the kid in  

1:16:04.200,1:16:05.514
the go-kart that keeps
crashing into the wall.

1:16:05.514,1:16:07.080
Trog: Yeah, I guess that’s my answer.

1:16:07.080,1:16:07.560
Baaulp: That—

1:16:07.560,1:16:11.640
Trog: There’s some YouTube 
video that’s called like, “Epic 

1:16:11.640,1:16:15.180
Jared Fail 2003,” or something like that—

1:16:15.180,1:16:16.920
Wayne: That is a good fucking answer.

1:16:16.920,1:16:17.820
Gir: Is that missing?

1:16:17.820,1:16:19.860
Wayne: It was-it was this 
video called, “Epic Jared Fail 

1:16:19.860,1:16:22.680
2003,” where it played a song 
from Oneohtrix Point Never  

1:16:23.640,1:16:28.080
um, where it’s just a
kid in a go-kart like, failing  

1:16:28.080,1:16:32.100
to move out of this corner and just repeatedly
crashing into the wall over and over again,  

1:16:32.100,1:16:37.920
surprisingly hard, while his dad
just goes, “Jared! No, Jared you  

1:16:37.920,1:16:43.020
gotta just go in reverse! Jared!” And he
sounds so fucking like, defeated and sad.

1:16:43.020,1:16:47.040
Baaulp: Yeah, it’s like this 
dad like, desperately trying to 

1:16:47.040,1:16:52.860
teach a kid how to like, y’know turn, 
like the concept of like, “Alright, back 

1:16:52.860,1:16:57.540
up and turn the corner,” y’know, and 
the kid just does not get it, just slams 

1:16:58.260,1:17:01.734
into the-slams the go-kart 
over and over again [laughs].

1:17:01.734,1:17:06.736
Trog: I am—So we’re officially here on Where Do We 
Begin, we’re putting out an all-points bulletin—

1:17:06.736,1:17:06.774
Wayne: For “Epic Jared Fail 2003.”

1:17:06.774,1:17:10.740
Trog: We know we’ve asked for 
many things-we’ve asked for 

1:17:10.740,1:17:15.420
many things in the past, I know we-we 
asked for the um, will.i.am entertainment 

1:17:15.420,1:17:19.560
tonight and you guys managed to find 
that, so this is an all-points bulletin 

1:17:19.560,1:17:24.600
for a video called, “Epic Jared 
Fail,” and then some year after it,  

1:17:24.600,1:17:27.754
either like
2003 or 2005—

1:17:27.754,1:17:27.774
Wayne: 2003 or 2005.

1:17:27.774,1:17:29.100
Trog: Some year.

1:17:29.100,1:17:32.760
Baaulp: And I remember this-I 
hope I’m not wrong, ‘cause I 

1:17:32.760,1:17:35.640
don’t want to lead people astray, but 
I remember the go-kart being green.

1:17:35.640,1:17:37.200
Log: Why would that matter.

1:17:37.200,1:17:39.840
Baaulp: ‘Cause that helps 
people-that helps people narrow it 

1:17:39.840,1:17:41.460
down. It’s a kid in a green go-kart.

1:17:41.460,1:17:44.340
Trog: You will definitely know 
the video if you manage to 

1:17:44.340,1:17:47.880
find it, it’s possible that it’s not 
even out there, but if it is out there, 

1:17:47.880,1:17:48.900
please let us know.

1:17:48.900,1:17:51.540
Wayne: I can probably find 
the OPN song that was in the 

1:17:51.540,1:17:54.780
video, too. The uh, I don’t 
rem—I remember exactly what  

1:17:54.780,1:17:55.670
it sounds like I just
don’t remember the—

1:17:55.670,1:17:58.200
Trog: But yes, we miss that video forever,  

1:17:58.200,1:17:59.460
it’s very sad
that it’s gone.

1:17:59.460,1:18:03.900
Log: Well, there’s that. The 
only other thing I can think of 

1:18:03.900,1:18:07.440
is something that I actually 
was able to find recently.

1:18:07.440,1:18:08.160
Baaulp: Nice.

1:18:08.160,1:18:10.260
Gir: See, I have the same thing as well.

1:18:10.260,1:18:14.340
Log: It was like-it was like a 
mix that I just couldn’t find 

1:18:14.340,1:18:22.080
for like eight years, ‘cause it was 
something that I only knew of from-it was a 

1:18:22.080,1:18:29.040
site called JetSetRaid.io, like y’know, 
Jet Set Radio but .io, and or, that 

1:18:29.040,1:18:32.940
might be what exists now, there’s some 
site that’s like a radio station site 

1:18:32.940,1:18:36.600
with a Jet Set Radio theme that plays 
songs, whatever. There used to be another 

1:18:36.600,1:18:39.720
one that was just a list of tracks 
and it was like, “Alright, here’s my 

1:18:39.720,1:18:44.700
recommendations.” Um, there was one on 
there that was just a mix with an unknown 

1:18:44.700,1:18:51.960
artist and it was-I thought it was good, and 
it was like-the name of it was in gib-was 

1:18:51.960,1:18:58.020
like gibberish, too. And that site just 
went down at some point and it never 

1:18:58.020,1:18:58.620
came back up.

1:18:58.620,1:19:00.960
Wayne: Before we move too far 
on, I did figure out the name 

1:19:00.960,1:19:05.460
of the song from the Epic Jared Fail 
video, it’s the Oneohtrix Point Never – 

1:19:05.460,1:19:09.600
Replica, that is the song that 
plays in the Epic Jared Fail video.

1:19:09.600,1:19:12.900
Trog: Please find this for 
us. We’ve looked everywhere, 

1:19:12.900,1:19:15.420
so it’s probably gone, but if it’s not…

1:19:15.420,1:19:19.680
Gir: I did have a video, or 
rather a person who made videos 

1:19:19.680,1:19:26.460
that I also could not find for fucking 
years at a time, and then a couple 

1:19:26.460,1:19:30.420
months ago finally discovered it. I 
could not tell you the person’s name off 

1:19:30.420,1:19:36.120
the top of my head right now, but it 
was this guy that would make microwave 

1:19:36.120,1:19:40.440
art, where he would throw shit into a 
microwave and then once it came back out 

1:19:40.440,1:19:45.720
all melted and fucked up and burnt, he 
would like stick like eyeballs on-like 

1:19:46.560,1:19:51.240
plastic eyes onto it and different 
colors and shit all over it,  

1:19:52.140,1:19:56.460
and I remember just
being fascinated by this guy when I was younger.  

1:19:57.000,1:20:02.340
And then for, I guess in 2010
he got banned from YouTube—

1:20:02.340,1:20:03.060
Trog: Damn.

1:20:03.060,1:20:07.140
Gir: And that’s why I couldn’t 
find him. And then come year 2020 

1:20:07.140,1:20:10.770
I finally found all his videos, 
they were just up on Dailymotion.

1:20:10.770,1:20:14.220
Log: That’s cool Gir, but I 
wasn’t finished with my story.

1:20:14.220,1:20:16.560
Gir: Okay, well my story was better, so.

1:20:16.560,1:20:16.980
Log: Mmm.

1:20:16.980,1:20:17.590
Gir: Mmm [laughs].

1:20:17.590,1:20:22.740
Log: Well, anyways, that site 
was gone-that site was gone, 

1:20:22.740,1:20:27.720
it took me till this year to think, “Oh, 
maybe I should just go on the Wayback Machine 

1:20:28.260,1:20:33.840
on that site, and so I did and it worked, 
I mean obviously the songs-the sound 

1:20:33.840,1:20:36.720
files weren’t there anymore, 
but the title was there,  

1:20:36.720,1:20:39.600
tried Google searching it
but it was just like, like I said,  

1:20:39.600,1:20:43.920
it was gibberish. I got a Reddit thread by
the guy who made the mix and he was like,  

1:20:43.920,1:20:49.089
“Hey, I made this mix, go check it
out.” But the link was to fuckin’ Megaupload.

1:20:49.089,1:20:49.324
Trog and Gir: Oh no.

1:20:49.325,1:20:49.490
[Wayne laughs]

1:20:49.489,1:20:55.120
Trog: He wanted to send files across the globe!

1:20:55.120,1:20:55.133
Gir: Classic.

1:20:55.133,1:20:56.340
Wayne: Oh, man.

1:20:56.340,1:21:01.500
Log: I was-I was like, “Nooo! 
But wait, where do I share my 

1:21:01.500,1:21:06.420
files across the globe now?” I go on 
SoundCloud, I type it in, and what do you 

1:21:06.420,1:21:10.860
know, somebody uploaded-somebody uploaded 
that mix without permission and now 

1:21:10.860,1:21:13.554
it’s the only source of it existing 
in the entire Internet now.

1:21:13.554,1:21:15.235
Trog: Hell yeah. Well, hey, you did it, then.

1:21:15.235,1:21:15.840
Gir: Gotta love it.

1:21:15.840,1:21:22.800
Wayne: My answer’s a lumpsum 
of things. I want to see-I wish 

1:21:22.800,1:21:26.460
I still had access to the first ever 
YouTube Poop I ever watched. I remember it 

1:21:26.460,1:21:29.820
by name, but it doesn’t exist anymore. 
I don’t remember who uploaded it, it was 

1:21:29.820,1:21:34.560
called, uh, it was called, “Youtube 
Poop: Insert Your Blank Here,” and it was 

1:21:34.560,1:21:40.380
like, it was a YouTube Poop of 
Egoraptor’s—what were his-what  

1:21:40.380,1:21:41.875
were his original
series that got him—

1:21:41.875,1:21:42.300
Gir: Awesome Series.

1:21:42.300,1:21:45.660
Wayne: Yeah, it was like Katamari 
Awesome, it was just like 

1:21:45.660,1:21:50.460
this loop of like the-the King of All 
Cosmos saying, “Good work, son, now it’s 

1:21:50.460,1:21:54.480
time to play on Uranus!” Over and over, 
and then like it just would be different 

1:21:54.480,1:21:56.760
every time. It was the most simple 
shit, but I thought it was fuckin’ 

1:21:56.760,1:22:00.720
hilarious. And the other lost videos 
that I can’t watch anymore that are 

1:22:00.720,1:22:06.000
literally gone is every video that was 
on my original YouTube account that got 

1:22:06.000,1:22:10.440
taken down for like a trap video or 
whatever. If you don’t know what a trap 

1:22:10.440,1:22:14.100
video is, it’s whenever you fuckin’ like, 
upload a video that’s like, “Halo 3 All 

1:22:14.100,1:22:18.180
Cheat Codes,” and it’s just a bunch of 
loud noises with a thumbnail in the middle 

1:22:18.180,1:22:22.500
that was popular back in like 2010. That 
was like, before they had figured out 

1:22:22.500,1:22:25.860
the YouTube algorithm, that kind of shit 
doesn’t happen anymore. You never get 

1:22:25.860,1:22:30.180
recommended some shit on YouTube that’s 
like, “Wow! Craziest Sharpest Knife in 

1:22:30.180,1:22:32.416
the World!” And it’s just a bunch 
of loud noise, that doesn’t happen.

1:22:32.416,1:22:32.440
Trog: Yeah, it’s true.

1:22:32.440,1:22:32.453
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:22:32.453,1:22:35.100
Wayne: They-they definitely 
figured out how to stop that 

1:22:35.100,1:22:38.820
phenomenon, which is funny. Yeah, I 
would-I would like to see all my old, 

1:22:38.820,1:22:42.600
original YouTube Poops. Do you 
remember what your earliest  

1:22:42.600,1:22:44.880
YouTube Poops were called?
Whoever used to make them?

1:22:44.880,1:22:46.133
Baaulp: I still have them up.

1:22:46.132,1:22:48.719
Gir: Yeah, let me go to my 
YouTube Channel and look at them.

1:22:48.720,1:22:49.800
Wayne: That’s true,  

1:22:49.800,1:22:51.286
that’s-you guys actually have them
archived.

1:22:51.286,1:22:53.550
Trog: Yeah, I don’t. Mine are gone, unfortunately.

1:22:53.550,1:22:56.280
Wayne: My first ever YouTube 
Poop was called, “Yoshi likes 

1:22:56.280,1:23:02.640
to burp,” and it was-it was like Yoshi 
burping and Windows Movie Maker stock 

1:23:02.640,1:23:03.460
sound effects.

1:23:03.460,1:23:03.475
[Baaulp laughs]

1:23:03.475,1:23:08.460
Gir: Let me look, just ‘cause I’m 
curious now. Here it is, “YouTube 

1:23:08.460,1:23:09.660
Poop - Sorry.”

1:23:09.660,1:23:12.224
[Wayne, Baaulp, and Trog laugh]

1:23:12.223,1:23:16.259
Trog: This question is from 
Fae, who asks, “What’s something 

1:23:16.260,1:23:18.360
that you didn’t like at first but grew on you,  

1:23:18.360,1:23:20.940
or you revisited and found
things to like about it?”

1:23:20.940,1:23:22.140
Wayne: Dead by Daylight.

1:23:22.140,1:23:26.580
Gir: Oh yeah, that’s easy for 
Wayne. For me, it was Mass 

1:23:26.580,1:23:32.040
Effect. When I first played 
Mass Effect, I fucking hated it.

1:23:32.040,1:23:33.510
Wayne: Which one did you start with? One?

1:23:33.510,1:23:34.440
Gir: Number one!

1:23:34.440,1:23:35.025
Wayne: Yeah.

1:23:35.025,1:23:38.400
Gir: I fucking got it-I got 
it and I fucking played like 

1:23:38.400,1:23:42.300
half an hour, I think I didn’t even make 
it off—I think I made it off of the like, 

1:23:42.300,1:23:47.340
main pl-the first planet you’re on, basically 
the tutorial planet, and I was like, 

1:23:47.340,1:23:50.700
“This game fucking sucks! This game 
blows, what the fucking big deal about 

1:23:50.700,1:23:57.180
this?” And then it was-I want to say it 
was the summer that Mass Effect 3 came 

1:23:57.180,1:24:03.540
out or like the summer after, and uh, I was 
just really bored and I was like, “Y’know 

1:24:03.540,1:24:06.780
what? I’m gonna ahead and give this 
another try, I didn’t-I don’t even remember 

1:24:06.780,1:24:13.500
how much of it I played.” And I finished 
it all in like a day or two and I was 

1:24:13.500,1:24:18.480
like, “Well that was fucking fantastic, 
let’s move onto the next one." And then 

1:24:18.480,1:24:23.880
I played all of fuckin two in a couple 
days, and then I moved onto three and 

1:24:23.880,1:24:26.340
uh, saw why everyone was disappointed.

1:24:26.340,1:24:29.220
Baaulp: Damn. What a letdown. 
You played through the whole 

1:24:29.220,1:24:30.480
series and then you got to three?

1:24:30.480,1:24:33.420
Gir: [Laughs] Yeah. I still like Mass Effect,  

1:24:33.420,1:24:34.680
there’s still
a lot to like there.

1:24:34.680,1:24:39.300
Baaulp: For me it uh, I think 
it was Neverwinter Nights.

1:24:39.300,1:24:40.012
Gir: Really.

1:24:40.012,1:24:42.720
Baaulp: I got a copy from my 
cousin when I was a little kid 

1:24:42.720,1:24:48.000
and I like, didn’t get it as a kid, and 
then I revisited it back like, in high 

1:24:48.000,1:24:52.320
school, I was like, “Woah, this shit is 
dope,” and then I was hooked. That is 

1:24:52.320,1:24:58.080
still a game-I’ve boughten that game 
multiple times, and as long as people keep 

1:24:58.080,1:25:04.060
remastering it, I buy the new version 
and then like, I’ll just like—Maybe every 

1:25:04.060,1:25:07.800
once in a blue moon I go like, “Mmm, 
gonna turn that game on, start a new 

1:25:07.800,1:25:12.360
character, play a little bit of it.” And 
then like, every year or so-every two 

1:25:12.360,1:25:16.860
years or so, I get the hankering to 
like beat it from start to finish again.

1:25:16.860,1:25:21.960
Trog: For me, this is like, 
I-I guess this kind of counts, 

1:25:22.500,1:25:26.760
whenever I played through Sekiro the 
first time, I fucking hated it. Until I 

1:25:26.760,1:25:29.620
beat the final boss, and immediately 
started a second playthrough.

1:25:29.620,1:25:29.634
[Wayne laughs]

1:25:29.634,1:25:32.565
Trog: That game made me so fucking mad.

1:25:32.565,1:25:33.840
Gir, laughing: Why did you do that?

1:25:33.840,1:25:34.545
Trog: I don’t know.

1:25:34.545,1:25:35.400
Gir, laughing: You don’t know!

1:25:35.400,1:25:37.920
Wayne: I remember when that 
game launched and you like-like, 

1:25:37.920,1:25:42.060
recounting your tales and experience 
with it and being so fuckin’ mad and 

1:25:42.060,1:25:45.660
shitting on it and I was just like-I 
was over here like, “No, baby, no, no. 

1:25:45.660,1:25:48.060
This is like perfect game for you.”

1:25:48.060,1:25:48.827
Trog: [Crosstalk] I was just 
shittin’ on it, I was so mad.

1:25:48.827,1:25:51.654
Wayne: Trog, you love Souls 
games. And then yes, it did—

1:25:51.654,1:25:52.426
Trog: I did, I did come around—

1:25:52.426,1:25:55.800
Wayne: Sekiro did that to 
people, Sekiro did that to a 

1:25:55.800,1:25:56.574
number of people in our group.

1:25:56.574,1:25:56.940
Trog: I know.

1:25:56.940,1:26:00.780
Wayne: You hated it, Rex hated 
it, Moupi hated it, like, we 

1:26:00.780,1:26:03.990
had a bunch of friends that just 
like, fuckin’ couldn’t stand Sekiro.

1:26:03.990,1:26:08.040
Trog: It truly is a bizarre 
thing where it-yeah, it just 

1:26:08.040,1:26:11.760
like, it tricks you into hating it until you beat  

1:26:11.760,1:26:14.880
it and it’s like wait, I
think I had fun this time.

1:26:14.880,1:26:16.320
Wayne: “Fuck this game! I’m gonna play it again.”

1:26:16.320,1:26:17.008
Trog: Exactly.

1:26:17.008,1:26:17.029
[Gir and Wayne laugh]

1:26:17.029,1:26:19.980
Trog: Hey, egg on my face, what can you say.

1:26:19.980,1:26:23.640
Wayne: Yeah, like I said, Dead 
by Daylight is my answer. Um, 

1:26:23.640,1:26:27.540
a couple years back I was in a relationship 
and uh, my partner had asked me to play 

1:26:27.540,1:26:32.160
Dead by Daylight with her and like, I’m 
of the interest in doing that, like if 

1:26:32.160,1:26:34.380
my partner asked me to do something 
with them I’m going to say yes, ‘cause I 

1:26:34.380,1:26:39.420
want to bond, so we tried Dead by Daylight 
together and I played as a survivor, 

1:26:39.420,1:26:44.520
and I thought it was just the most boring, 
dogshit game. Like I was just like, “Okay, 

1:26:44.520,1:26:48.060
we-we walk around—” And this was after 
Friday the 13th had launched, which is a 

1:26:48.060,1:26:52.500
very similar game that I very much 
enjoyed, I only played the survivor 

1:26:52.500,1:26:55.140
experience, and I just like ran around 
and she was telling me what to do and it’s 

1:26:55.140,1:26:58.560
like, “Wait, we just run around and go 
to these generators and hold down mouse 

1:26:58.560,1:27:04.080
one and press space every few minutes?” 
And like, that was all she could tell 

1:27:04.080,1:27:08.640
me it was, and I was like, “I can’t 
believe this game is that boring." And then 

1:27:08.640,1:27:11.100
the fact that you couldn’t play killer 
with your friends like you could in Friday 

1:27:11.100,1:27:16.980
the 13th, had me just thinking that that 
game was fucking dogshit. And then Scorpy 

1:27:16.980,1:27:22.200
got into it, he tried for one of his 
horror streams a few months back, and uh, 

1:27:22.200,1:27:25.500
and I was like-for one of his streams 
I was like, “Y’know what, I’ll try that 

1:27:25.500,1:27:29.640
game again,” and me, Gir, and Scorpy 
played it, and like, something about it 

1:27:29.640,1:27:33.060
was just like, there’s something here. 
Something about like, the first game I 

1:27:33.060,1:27:36.600
played coming back was the survivor 
mode, and like, something about the fact 

1:27:36.600,1:27:41.820
that like, the fact that that game is 
mostly balanced around the fact that one 

1:27:41.820,1:27:45.360
team can see in third person and has 
this giant FOV and the other team is 

1:27:45.360,1:27:49.380
powerful but can only see in first person 
like, something about like, just hiding 

1:27:49.380,1:27:53.760
behind a small little box as Scorpy 
walked right past me and he didn’t see me, 

1:27:53.760,1:27:57.540
I was like, “Okay, that’s kind of 
neat.” Like, I’m into this concept.

1:27:57.540,1:27:59.040
Baaulp: It’s advanced hide and seek.

1:27:59.040,1:28:01.740
Wayne: Yeah, when—Advanced 
hide and seek, advanced cat and 

1:28:01.740,1:28:04.380
mouse. And then I-and then I started 
playing killer and was like, “Okay,  

1:28:04.380,1:28:07.800
this is fucking fun.” And now I’m 
like, one of my main games, now. Yeah,  

1:28:07.800,1:28:13.260
that was like a total shift. ‘Cause I like-I 
went years like, not only disliking the game,  

1:28:13.260,1:28:17.760
but expressing to other people how much I 
fucking hated it. Like-like a few months back,  

1:28:17.760,1:28:21.360
Lauren got into it and any time she brought 
it up I was like, “How can you play this?  

1:28:21.360,1:28:26.340
How are you enjoying this?” And she got so 
annoyed with me because I couldn’t stop—Like,  

1:28:26.340,1:28:31.425
something about Dead by Daylight made me so 
mad and now I’m a changed man, and I regret—

1:28:31.425,1:28:32.040
Trog: [Laughs] Upset you.

1:28:32.040,1:28:33.115
Wayne, laughing: Yes.

1:28:33.115,1:28:34.680
Gir: Stop having fun!

1:28:34.680,1:28:38.040
Log: Uhh… Mustard.

1:28:38.940,1:28:40.668
Trog: [Laughs] Yeah, Alright.

1:28:40.668,1:28:41.370
Baaulp: The food? Alright?

1:28:41.370,1:28:43.380
Wayne: Y’know, actually I change my answer.  

1:28:43.980,1:28:45.300
I change my
answer. Sex.

1:28:45.300,1:28:45.780
[Log laughs]

1:28:45.780,1:28:46.900
Trog: Okay.

1:28:46.900,1:28:46.915
[Baaulp laughs]

1:28:46.915,1:28:48.960
Gir: Ya hated it, now ya love it.

1:28:48.960,1:28:49.980
Log: Uh, pickles.

1:28:49.980,1:28:52.860
Trog: Y’know, I kind of 
feel the same about mustard.

1:28:52.860,1:28:55.080
Baaulp: That sounds like you just growing up.

1:28:55.080,1:28:55.920
Trog: Yeah.

1:28:55.920,1:28:58.200
Wayne: I almost think foods that 
you disliked when you were young 

1:28:58.200,1:28:59.880
and now that you do like is a different question.

1:28:59.880,1:29:03.300
Trog: ‘Cause that’s like 
literally your physiology of your 

1:29:03.300,1:29:08.580
body is changing, which causes you to 
like or dislike different tastes. But I 

1:29:08.580,1:29:12.180
agree about mustard. I hated mustard as 
a kid, but now I’m all about it. It’s 

1:29:12.180,1:29:12.720
yummy.

1:29:12.720,1:29:13.614
Gir: Mustards good, yeah.

1:29:13.614,1:29:17.220
Trog: Mustard is too strong 
tasting for a young child, but 

1:29:17.220,1:29:18.600
delicious for me, an adult.

1:29:18.600,1:29:20.460
Wayne: Unless you’re like a fucked up child and  

1:29:20.460,1:29:21.107
you drink
it.

1:29:21.107,1:29:22.440
Gir: Are you talking about me, what?

1:29:22.440,1:29:25.599
Log: I hated Street Fighter V, and I still do.

1:29:25.599,1:29:25.614
[Baaulp laughs]

1:29:25.614,1:29:28.495
Trog: That’s not—That doesn’t answer the question.

1:29:28.495,1:29:29.280
Gir: That’s not the question.

1:29:29.280,1:29:31.800
Wayne: Dude, I was a reverse 
situation where I thought I 

1:29:31.800,1:29:35.700
liked Street Fighter V for a while 
and then I hated it. Still hate it.

1:29:35.700,1:29:36.600
Baaulp: Damn.

1:29:36.600,1:29:41.280
Log: What have I shifted my 
opinion on? Usually I feel like I 

1:29:41.280,1:29:42.472
get it right the first time [unintelligible]—

1:29:42.472,1:29:48.900
Baaulp: Damn, Log has never changed his opinion on 
anything, he’s been right the first time always.

1:29:48.900,1:29:53.940
Wayne: I can’t really explain why in short 
words, but that makes perfect sense for Log.

1:29:57.900,1:29:58.680
Baaulp: Yeah. I mean I’m  

1:29:58.680,1:30:02.940
like that about a lot of things,
too. I-I sus out what I like and don’t like ASAP.

1:30:02.940,1:30:06.960
Log: Yeah, it’s hard for me—What 
was something that I didn’t 

1:30:06.960,1:30:08.086
like? And I came back to it?

1:30:08.086,1:30:09.300
Baaulp: Maybe you don’t have 
anything, you don’t have 

1:30:09.300,1:30:10.500
anything—You don’t have to have an answer.

1:30:10.500,1:30:13.620
Log: ‘Cause I feel like it 
makes no sense that I wouldn’t 

1:30:13.620,1:30:16.800
have something like that ‘cause 
there’s so much stuff out there.  

1:30:17.760,1:30:20.100
But what could
it be?

1:30:20.100,1:30:22.140
Trog: I just usually don’t commit that kind of  

1:30:22.140,1:30:22.841
stuff to
memory.

1:30:22.841,1:30:22.854
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:30:22.854,1:30:25.200
Trog: I just know Sekiro 
‘cause it happened recently.

1:30:25.200,1:30:26.700
Baaulp: Yeah, that’s the thing.

1:30:26.700,1:30:29.220
Gir: I remember Mass Effect 
because it was such a big flip.

1:30:29.220,1:30:33.420
Trog: Whenever I was a kid, I 
didn’t like rap. But-but then 

1:30:33.420,1:30:36.224
I listened to wrap and I 
thought, “Yeah, this is good.”

1:30:36.224,1:30:37.140
Log: Yeah. Yeah I feel like that’s—

1:30:37.140,1:30:39.120
Wayne: Music is definitely a  

1:30:39.120,1:30:40.675
strong contender for your
choice for this question.

1:30:40.675,1:30:43.620
Gir: I’ll admit I was the 
kid in like, sixth grade that 

1:30:43.620,1:30:46.620
said, “I like all music except rap or country.”

1:30:46.620,1:30:47.700
Trog: A classic.

1:30:47.700,1:30:50.880
Log: I feel like whenever I 
was a kid I just had like, a 

1:30:50.880,1:30:55.320
general disdain for music. Like, 
I don’t care about any songs.

1:30:55.320,1:30:56.802
Trog: That’s wild to say.

1:30:56.802,1:30:58.020
Gir: That’s how I am now.

1:30:58.020,1:30:58.435
[Wayne laughs]

1:30:58.435,1:31:00.720
Log: I mean I only heard songs that  

1:31:00.720,1:31:02.148
played on like, the car
radio and that was it.

1:31:02.148,1:31:02.760
Trog: Sure, yeah.

1:31:02.760,1:31:05.460
Wayne: You played video games. Video  

1:31:05.460,1:31:07.609
game music, like video
game music?

1:31:07.609,1:31:09.000
Log: Yeah, I guess—I mean like,  

1:31:11.280,1:31:15.630
there’d be like one song per
game that I would put on a loop and that’d be it.

1:31:15.630,1:31:20.280
Wayne: I was that kind of kid, 
where like, when I was young 

1:31:20.280,1:31:23.520
I didn’t pay attention, I didn’t have 
favorite bands except for like, just 

1:31:23.520,1:31:25.593
stuff my dad listened to that I also liked—

1:31:25.593,1:31:25.613
Gir: Oh my god. I—

1:31:25.613,1:31:28.200
Wayne: —like I thought Styx was 
one of my favorite bands and 

1:31:28.200,1:31:32.640
it’s absolutely not, however, I still 
do like that one song by Styx, it’s 

1:31:32.640,1:31:34.637
called like, Renegade, I think? 
That’s the only one I remember.

1:31:34.637,1:31:34.663
Trog: That’s a good one.

1:31:34.663,1:31:39.780
Wayne: [Singing] I’m a 
wanted man. But, the uh—I was 

1:31:39.780,1:31:44.640
the kind of kid that fuckin’ loved video game 
music, so like when I was in third grade I got  

1:31:44.640,1:31:49.740
one of the earliest iPods and I would go to 
VGMusic.net so I’d just have like, Star Wolf  

1:31:49.740,1:31:55.140
theme on my—Star Wolf theme MIDI on my iPod and 
it was like, that is what I would listen to.

1:31:55.140,1:31:58.020
Gir: I know Log is struggling 
to think of his answer, but I 

1:31:58.020,1:32:01.620
just thought of an alternate answer 
for something that I didn’t like, like 

1:32:01.620,1:32:05.597
something I hated, but now 
I-I do enjoy. Uh, Scorpy.

1:32:05.597,1:32:05.610
[Trog laughs]

1:32:05.610,1:32:05.632
Wayne: [Laughs] Yeah!

1:32:05.632,1:32:09.113
Baaulp: Oh man.

1:32:09.113,1:32:11.921
Wayne: Y’know what, me too! Me fuckin’ too.

1:32:11.921,1:32:11.933
[Gir laughs]

1:32:11.933,1:32:15.840
Wayne: Scorpy pissed me off. 
Scorpy was this fuckin’—he was 

1:32:15.840,1:32:18.689
like the YouTube Poop Steam 
Chat equivalent of an upstart—

1:32:18.689,1:32:18.713
Gir: He was an asshole.

1:32:18.713,1:32:21.420
Wayne: —where he just showed 
up, was an asshole, and he just 

1:32:21.420,1:32:25.410
got Admin on the TF2 server 
inexplicably for no reason—

1:32:25.410,1:32:25.433
Trog: It made no sense.

1:32:25.433,1:32:28.050
Wayne: —and he was just a fuckin’ dick!

1:32:28.050,1:32:31.440
Gir: He was an asshole [laughs]. He was a dick!

1:32:31.440,1:32:32.329
Trog: People can change.

1:32:32.329,1:32:33.420
Wayne: Now he’s like one of the nicest  

1:32:33.420,1:32:33.955
people I know
[laughs].

1:32:33.955,1:32:34.980
Gir: Yeah, now he’s a great friend.

1:32:34.980,1:32:36.510
Trog: Yeah, but it is funny.

1:32:36.510,1:32:36.534
Baaulp: Scorpy’s dope.

1:32:36.534,1:32:40.560
Trog: Yeah, no, I remember 
being indignant about that as 

1:32:40.560,1:32:43.560
well. I was like, “Who the fuck is this 
Scorpy guy, he literally just walks in 

1:32:43.560,1:32:48.050
and gets Admin? What the fuck?” Like, 
I still don’t know how that happened.

1:32:48.050,1:32:51.660
Wayne: He got Mod in the Steam Chat 
and he got Admin on the TF2 server,  

1:32:51.660,1:32:56.187
and like specifically Admin on the TF2 server, 
I resented him so much for that because, like—

1:32:56.187,1:32:56.202
[Baaulp laughs]

1:32:56.202,1:32:56.213
Trog: Mhmm.

1:32:56.213,1:32:58.500
Wayne: —Mod in the Steam 
Chat, that’s one thing. That’s 

1:32:58.500,1:33:02.100
whatever. But Admin on the 
TF2 server, that was a fucking  

1:33:02.100,1:33:03.355
coveted seat, because
you could do shit—

1:33:03.355,1:33:04.362
Gir: That was a golden ticket.

1:33:04.362,1:33:04.373
Trog: Yeah.

1:33:04.373,1:33:09.191
Wayne: —You were playing a different game if you 
were an Admin on the YouTube Poop TF2 server.

1:33:09.191,1:33:09.233
Trog: [Laughs] You could just fuck around.

1:33:09.233,1:33:09.420
Wayne: Yeah.

1:33:09.420,1:33:11.940
Baalp: Yeah, we were-we were 
playing TF2 like every day.

1:33:11.940,1:33:14.340
Wayne: Scorpy would just like, 
spend his time putting on 

1:33:14.340,1:33:18.840
like, derogatory like, mocking hats on 
people forcibly and spawning pumpkins on 

1:33:18.840,1:33:21.029
them and blowing them up while 
they’re trying to play TF2.

1:33:21.029,1:33:21.040
Trog: Yeah.

1:33:21.040,1:33:21.055
[Baaulp laughs]

1:33:21.055,1:33:23.520
Gir: See, I didn’t help that 
by making a hat replacement 

1:33:23.520,1:33:24.780
that was just a big dick.

1:33:24.780,1:33:26.330
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

1:33:26.329,1:33:31.020
Wayne: [Inhales loudly] I’m just 
thinking of that one guy-that 

1:33:31.020,1:33:34.740
one guy who played Scout that was so 
laggy that he moved slower than every 

1:33:34.740,1:33:36.818
other class, and you would 
put the hats on him and—

1:33:36.818,1:33:38.124
[Gir, Baaulp, Trog, and Wayne laugh]

1:33:38.124,1:33:41.867
Trog: Oh man, good times on the 
TF2 server. The battledrobe.

1:33:41.867,1:33:42.613
Wayne: Yeah, very different times.

1:33:42.613,1:33:42.634
Gir: The battledrobe.

1:33:42.634,1:33:42.655
Trog: What a classic.

1:33:42.655,1:33:44.931
Log: I have nothing.

1:33:44.931,1:33:48.240
Gir: Log got nothing, Log has 
liked everything he’s liked 

1:33:48.240,1:33:49.260
and hated everything he hated.

1:33:49.260,1:33:52.680
Log: I like everything on the 
first try. That’s kind of how 

1:33:52.680,1:33:56.760
it goes for me, is like I-like I—I feel 
like I generally have a good opinion of 

1:33:56.760,1:34:00.300
stuff going in until it does-until it-it—

1:34:00.300,1:34:02.280
Gir: Until it sours it?

1:34:02.280,1:34:06.420
Log: Until it-until it bites 
the hand that feeds it, and 

1:34:06.420,1:34:09.020
then I throw it in the dumpster 
and I never speak of it again.

1:34:09.020,1:34:12.780
Wayne: Sawsily asks, “What’s the best YouTube  

1:34:12.780,1:34:14.100
comment you’ve
ever seen?”

1:34:14.100,1:34:18.300
Trog: Oh my god, that’s 
impossible. I’ve seen so many!

1:34:18.300,1:34:20.760
Wayne: There’s so many good 
ones. We got a whole blog 

1:34:20.760,1:34:21.524
dedicated to it.

1:34:21.524,1:34:23.033
Trog: We have a Tumblr dedicated to it, yeah.

1:34:23.033,1:34:25.980
Wayne: Okay, okay maybe that 
one is too like, divisive.

1:34:25.980,1:34:30.000
Trog: I’d say, for that question, 
just a generic answer is: go 

1:34:30.000,1:34:34.320
look at the comment-tube Tumblr, 
and that’s our collective answer.

1:34:35.760,1:34:36.233
Gir: Yeah.

1:34:36.233,1:34:38.820
Wayne: Iprix on our Discord 
server asks, “What contests or 

1:34:38.820,1:34:42.360
competitions have the crew been in? 
How did they go? Does going hotdog  

1:34:47.520,1:34:48.111
eating
contest?”

1:34:48.111,1:34:48.134
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

1:34:48.134,1:34:48.173
Gir: Yeah, going hotdog eating contest.

1:34:48.173,1:34:50.040
Wayne: Not quite sure what you’re asking there at  

1:34:50.040,1:34:50.700
the end,
uh—

1:34:50.700,1:34:54.480
Trog: Don’t take this the wrong way, 
this is not an invitation to spam the  

1:34:54.480,1:34:58.500
question’s channel with nonsense, I only 
brought this one up because I think this  

1:34:58.500,1:35:01.484
person made a genuine mistake, 
which makes it actually funny.

1:35:01.484,1:35:04.920
Wayne: [Laughs] Yeah, like—

1:35:04.920,1:35:07.500
Trog: It’s not funny if you 
just say nonsense and you know 

1:35:07.500,1:35:10.920
you’re saying it. It’s only funny if 
you fucked up and said something wrong.

1:35:10.920,1:35:11.618
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:35:11.618,1:35:14.760
Trog: I was in a lot of 
competitions as a kid, mostly 

1:35:14.760,1:35:20.280
because of my being in band, y’know 
like, you do-you do—there’s like a lot of 

1:35:20.280,1:35:24.780
competition in band and stuff in high 
school, and even in middle school. I’m 

1:35:24.780,1:35:29.220
trying to think if there’s anything 
that I entered by myself, though.

1:35:29.220,1:35:33.420
Baaulp: Yeah, every competition 
thing I was entered into was 

1:35:33.420,1:35:39.060
like, forcibly, like, “Oh, science fair? 
I don’t want to do science fair, science 

1:35:39.060,1:35:43.500
is fuckin’ lame. Well, we’re going to 
do science fair,” and because I was also 

1:35:43.500,1:35:47.760
trying to get a good grade I was usually 
picked I was like, “Well, what—I-I 

1:35:47.760,1:35:53.340
don’t-I don’t want this.” I remember in 
high school, doing an experiment that I 

1:35:53.340,1:35:59.220
thought would get me a good grade, but 
was mediocre enough for me to like, not 

1:35:59.220,1:36:03.720
have to do the school science fair, 
where like I competed against like other 

1:36:03.720,1:36:09.960
classes, and I still had to-I was still 
the best in my class, I was like, “This 

1:36:09.960,1:36:11.040
is bullshit, fuck this.”

1:36:11.040,1:36:14.400
Wayne: I feel like any contest 
I entered when I was a kid, I 

1:36:14.400,1:36:19.080
like, repressed because I lost, and it 
was bad. Like, I don’t think I ever won 

1:36:19.080,1:36:22.980
any big contest or anything like that. 
I know a story like, Scorpy told back in 

1:36:22.980,1:36:26.760
the YouTube Poop Steam Chat days, where 
like he-when he moved to Canada as an 

1:36:26.760,1:36:30.780
English speaking kid he got put in a 
English spelling bee with a bunch of 

1:36:30.780,1:36:32.492
French kids and just dominated them.

1:36:32.492,1:36:32.515
[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

1:36:32.515,1:36:33.900
Gir: That’s fucking funny.

1:36:33.900,1:36:35.160
Trog: That’s good.

1:36:35.160,1:36:39.300
Gir: I don’t remember it—There’s two things, I 
was told about this because I don’t remember,  

1:36:39.300,1:36:43.800
it was when I was really little, but 
I was in like a, egg and spoon race—

1:36:43.800,1:36:44.984
Trog: Hell yeah.

1:36:44.984,1:36:44.995
Wayne: Woo.

1:36:44.995,1:36:51.120
Gir: And I was told that I was 
like, second or third place, 

1:36:51.120,1:36:54.960
however, the entire time I had my 
hand on the egg, I was just cheating.

1:36:54.960,1:36:55.658
Trog: Nice.

1:36:55.658,1:36:55.672
[Wayne laughs]

1:36:55.672,1:36:58.740
Baaulp: Oh, so that’s like a 
good outcome, where you just 

1:36:58.740,1:37:01.427
cheated and you got second so 
that’s like, take what you can get.

1:37:01.427,1:37:03.060
Gir: I think I got good luck in terms of that  

1:37:03.060,1:37:03.715
kind of shit
[laughs].

1:37:03.715,1:37:04.800
Log: You still lost?

1:37:04.800,1:37:09.180
Gir: No, I won, like second 
or third or whatever. Um, they 

1:37:09.180,1:37:10.740
didn’t-I don’t think they noticed I was cheating.

1:37:10.740,1:37:14.026
Trog: Well, second or third isn’t winning, 
just thought I should point that out.

1:37:14.026,1:37:14.640
Log: [Laughs] Yeah.

1:37:14.640,1:37:17.700
Gir: It’s not last place, 
bitch, therefore it’s winning.

1:37:17.700,1:37:19.880
Log: But the-your hand was on the egg?

1:37:19.880,1:37:23.100
Gir: Uh-huh. And then the 
second thing was, like Baaulp 

1:37:23.100,1:37:28.200
said, a science fair contest thing. Where 
I didn’t want to do it, ‘cause like you said,  

1:37:28.200,1:37:31.020
we were forced to,
so I was like, “Fuck it,  

1:37:31.020,1:37:34.020
I’m just gonna do like a potato battery, or
something,” and this was like, middle school.  

1:37:34.020,1:37:39.120
So, I-I got a potato, got like
a-the thing that tests current,  

1:37:39.120,1:37:43.500
stuck it in the potato, was like, “I think
there’s a current? Fuck this,” and then  

1:37:43.500,1:37:47.257
I downloaded somebody else’s project, and
presented it, and got second place [laughs].

1:37:47.257,1:37:47.272
Trog: Ah, yes.

1:37:47.272,1:37:52.140
Baaulp: No, you had to run the 
gambit, that’s-that’s the problem,  

1:37:52.140,1:37:55.440
you gotta be mediocre. You should 
have stuck with the potato.

1:37:55.440,1:37:59.040
Gir: I got second place for—No, 
it was another-I downloaded 

1:37:59.040,1:38:01.841
somebody else’s potato report! I plagiarized it.

1:38:01.841,1:38:01.853
Baaulp: Oh.

1:38:01.853,1:38:05.160
Wayne: I plagiarized when I—I 
think I told this story on one 

1:38:05.160,1:38:08.880
of the podcasts, where I plagiarized my 
sister’s traced Spiderman drawing for 

1:38:08.880,1:38:10.589
an art contest at one point.

1:38:10.589,1:38:10.601
[Gir laughs]

1:38:10.601,1:38:10.800
Trog, laughing: Oh no.

1:38:10.800,1:38:14.220
Wayne: Which is like, double 
bad because like, one, it was 

1:38:14.220,1:38:18.480
clearly on tracing paper and was 
traced, and two, I didn’t do it.

1:38:18.480,1:38:19.601
Trog: Yeah. Yeah.

1:38:19.601,1:38:19.613
[Gir laughs]

1:38:19.613,1:38:22.080
Wayne: I actually did think of 
an answer of a time I was in like 

1:38:22.080,1:38:26.460
a, sort of competition where like, I 
used to go to like, summer camp, not like 

1:38:26.460,1:38:29.580
stay-away, it was just kind of this thing 
where like you would, like during the 

1:38:29.580,1:38:32.520
day on certain days of the week during 
summer you’d like go up to the school 

1:38:32.520,1:38:36.000
and you would just do like fun shit. 
It was like-it was like parks and rec 

1:38:36.000,1:38:37.320
camp. I think that’s what it was called.

1:38:37.320,1:38:38.760
Baaulp: Yeah, I know that.

1:38:38.760,1:38:43.560
Wayne: We were playing like, Camp 
Jeopardy, and like, and there 

1:38:43.560,1:38:46.920
were like teams—it was like team Camp 
Jeopardy, and I think the winner of the 

1:38:46.920,1:38:50.520
team got like, coupons to get free sodas 
at lunch or something like that, and 

1:38:50.520,1:38:52.980
this actually ties into what I was talking 
about earlier, how I used to listen 

1:38:52.980,1:38:58.260
to video game music when I was a kid. And 
the final question in one of the categories, 

1:38:58.260,1:39:02.100
I don’t remember what the category was 
about, I think it was music, and it was 

1:39:02.100,1:39:04.860
like the one for the highest points, 
and it was like, if you got that one you 

1:39:04.860,1:39:09.000
won, and the question was—I remember, 
I specifically remember the guy pulling 

1:39:09.000,1:39:12.900
out the card and he was like, “What is 
the name of the song that plays on the 

1:39:12.900,1:39:16.440
title screen of the hit game, 
Kingdom Hearts?” And I instantly  

1:39:16.440,1:39:17.560
like [claps once]
hand shot up—

1:39:17.560,1:39:17.573
Baaulp: Ohhh.

1:39:17.573,1:39:18.587
Wayne: “Dearly Beloved.”

1:39:18.587,1:39:18.600
[Trog laughs]

1:39:18.600,1:39:22.320
Wayne: That is the nerdiest 
fucking fact to know when you’re 

1:39:22.320,1:39:25.980
in like, fourth grade, but knowing that 
fact, everyone went fucking apeshit 

1:39:25.980,1:39:28.680
over that, and I was like, the 
hero, and I got everyone soda.

1:39:28.680,1:39:35.220
Baaulp: Nice, nice. When you’re a kid like, a lot 
of people are like, “Oh, kids need competition,”  

1:39:35.220,1:39:40.320
and you’re right, but they should get to pick, 
you can’t like, you don’t-you can’t force kids  

1:39:40.320,1:39:45.900
into competition ‘cause they’ll hate it. This 
uh, I remember one year-I remember one year,  

1:39:45.900,1:39:51.720
when I was in middle school I remember getting 
our schedule and going like, “Wait a minute,  

1:39:51.720,1:39:58.140
I don’t have gym!” And apparently what they 
did was they just took half like-they just  

1:39:58.140,1:40:04.800
took half the kids in my grade, like fourth 
grade-or not fourth grade, in whatever,  

1:40:04.800,1:40:11.760
right? Whatever grade, and instead of gym we 
had dance class, which none of us signed up for,  

1:40:11.760,1:40:17.400
and so like half the grade was like, “What the 
fuck? We got dance class?” And then there’s  

1:40:17.400,1:40:20.935
like a dance competition and it was like, “We 
didn’t want this! What?” [Laughs] You can’t—

1:40:20.935,1:40:23.135
Gir: That sounds like shit.

1:40:23.135,1:40:23.149
[Wayne laughs]

1:40:23.149,1:40:24.831
Baaulp: It was so shitty.

1:40:24.831,1:40:27.360
Gir: Oh, no! Baaulp, you just 
unlocked a fucking hidden 

1:40:27.360,1:40:30.960
memory in my brain, I fucking had 
to learn square dancing in like,  

1:40:30.960,1:40:31.595
fourth
grade.

1:40:31.595,1:40:31.613
Baaulp: Oh my god.

1:40:31.613,1:40:33.840
Wayne: Yeah, I mean we’ve 
talked about that on our streams 

1:40:33.840,1:40:36.300
before like, I had to learn square dancing, too.

1:40:36.300,1:40:38.370
Gir: Fuck that! Square dancing sucks!

1:40:38.370,1:40:40.560
Trog: I never did. And I live in Texas.

1:40:40.560,1:40:43.500
Wayne: All I remember is-all 
I remember is the do-si-do.

1:40:43.500,1:40:49.020
Baaulp: I don’t know why! We-none of us knew 
why. None of us knew why. I don’t even think the  

1:40:49.020,1:40:54.180
dance teachers knew why they were there because 
like, I wanted gym like everyone else! And the  

1:40:54.180,1:40:58.020
worst part was like, kids would be like, “Haa, 
you got dance class.” And it was like, “Yeah,  

1:40:58.020,1:41:04.380
half of us have dance class you asshole [laughs]. 
Like, we didn’t pick this, no one picked this!”

1:41:04.380,1:41:07.380
Trog: Baaulp talking about 
splitting a bunch of kids up into 

1:41:07.380,1:41:11.880
two arbitrary groups unlocked a 
memory in my brain of a elementary 

1:41:11.880,1:41:16.620
school field day, y’know like, you guys 
had a field day at some point, right? 

1:41:16.620,1:41:18.471
Just like a bunch of little games or whatever.

1:41:18.471,1:41:18.505
Gir: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:41:18.505,1:41:18.534
Wayne: And they were a blast.

1:41:18.534,1:41:22.200
Trog: I’m realizing now how 
fucked up it was, and also the 

1:41:22.200,1:41:25.380
fact that this memory has stayed in 
my head this long shows that it’s 

1:41:25.380,1:41:31.080
fucked up, is that we did a field day 
on elemen-like in elementary school, and 

1:41:31.080,1:41:33.579
they’re just supposed to be a bunch 
of fun games that you play, right?

1:41:33.579,1:41:33.594
Baaulp: Uh-huh.

1:41:33.594,1:41:37.740
Trog: But at the end they gave 
everybody either first place 

1:41:37.740,1:41:38.880
or second place.

1:41:38.880,1:41:39.840
Baaulp: What?

1:41:39.840,1:41:40.855
Trog: Yeah! Like they—

1:41:40.855,1:41:43.020
Gir: Oh, it was one of those deals. No losers.

1:41:43.020,1:41:47.400
Trog: But as a third grader 
it’s like, “What the fuck?” Or 

1:41:47.400,1:41:50.520
even as an adult, I’m thinking about 
it’s like, what did they judge these kids 

1:41:50.520,1:41:54.840
on? Why did they just arbitrarily decide 
some kids get first place and some 

1:41:54.840,1:41:57.840
kids get second place, and I 
got second place and I was so  

1:41:57.840,1:41:59.550
fucking mad. I’m
still mad.

1:41:59.550,1:41:59.574
[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

1:41:59.574,1:42:04.200
Trog: Why did I get second 
place? Why-why was I bad at the 

1:42:04.200,1:42:06.521
fucking egg toss, like, what the fuck?

1:42:06.521,1:42:06.535
[Wayne laughs]

1:42:06.535,1:42:08.820
Log: You didn’t cheat. You shoulda kept your  

1:42:08.820,1:42:09.420
hand on the
egg.

1:42:09.420,1:42:09.720
Gir: Yeah.

1:42:09.720,1:42:12.540
Baaulp: Trog, they were judging 
you on how much fun you were 

1:42:12.540,1:42:13.980
having, you weren’t having enough fun.

1:42:13.980,1:42:15.300
Trog: I wasn’t having enough fun.

1:42:15.300,1:42:16.599
Wayne: You weren’t positive enough.

1:42:16.599,1:42:16.614
[Baaulp laughs]

1:42:16.614,1:42:19.320
Trog: I just think it’s fucked 
up to take a bunch of eight-year 

1:42:19.320,1:42:23.100
olds and then like, have them all play 
a bunch of games and then decide at the 

1:42:23.100,1:42:25.242
end who’s the winners and who’s the losers.

1:42:25.242,1:42:25.255
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:42:25.255,1:42:27.720
Gir: Yeah, that’s like worst than first,  

1:42:27.720,1:42:28.974
second, third, and
then like, participant.

1:42:28.974,1:42:31.920
Trog: Yeah, because it’s literally 
just first or second place, 

1:42:31.920,1:42:33.780
you either won or you lost.

1:42:33.780,1:42:36.060
Gir: You were either good or you weren’t good.

1:42:36.060,1:42:36.671
Trog: Yeah. Fucked up.

1:42:36.671,1:42:36.890
Gir: That’s worse for morale.

1:42:36.889,1:42:37.157
Baaulp: Yeah, that’s kind of shitty.

1:42:37.157,1:42:42.540
Trog: Oh, and then the other 
competition that I just 

1:42:42.540,1:42:46.440
remember was that one time I was a kid and 
I went to the Texas State Fair they-I-I 

1:42:46.440,1:42:50.482
did a game where I ran around a bunch 
of barrels and pretended to be a horse.

1:42:50.482,1:42:50.512
[Wayne, Baaulp, and Gir laugh]

1:42:50.512,1:42:55.560
Baaulp: What-what was your horse name?

1:42:55.560,1:42:57.091
Trog: I didn’t have a horse name.

1:42:57.091,1:42:57.115
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:42:57.115,1:42:58.260
Gir: Chuckles.

1:43:00.560,1:43:05.880
Log: I don’t think I ever won 
a competition that mattered. I 

1:43:05.880,1:43:11.400
know I won the spelling bee at my school 
whenever I was in sixth grade, and 

1:43:11.400,1:43:16.140
that meant that I went on to like the 
county spelling bee or something, or like 

1:43:16.140,1:43:17.220
a district, I don’t know.

1:43:17.220,1:43:17.633
Trog: Mhmm.

1:43:17.632,1:43:19.860
Log: And it’s like-it’s one of 
those things where it’s like 

1:43:19.860,1:43:23.640
you don’t prepare for it if 
you’re part of it ‘cause like,  

1:43:23.640,1:43:25.065
who gives a shit,
right?

1:43:25.065,1:43:25.075
Gir: Mhmm.

1:43:25.075,1:43:29.220
Log: It’s a spelling bee. But 
even so, whenever I got to 

1:43:29.220,1:43:32.460
that district spelling bee, 
and I lost, I was still mad,  

1:43:32.460,1:43:34.039
I was like, “What the
fuck was that word?”

1:43:34.039,1:43:34.060
Trog, laughing: Yeah.

1:43:34.060,1:43:34.075
[Baaulp laughs]

1:43:34.075,1:43:37.560
Log: It’s like, why are you 
giving me this hard word and 

1:43:37.560,1:43:39.660
everybody else is getting easy words.

1:43:39.660,1:43:41.880
Baaulp: You’re still mad even though you were  

1:43:41.880,1:43:42.780
like-you didn’t
care?

1:43:42.780,1:43:46.080
Log: I think that’s why I tend 
to avoid competitions like, 

1:43:46.080,1:43:48.780
if I’m in a competition, I want to fuckin’ win.

1:43:48.780,1:43:49.200
Trog: Yeah.

1:43:49.200,1:43:50.315
Log: And if I don’t win I get pissed.

1:43:50.315,1:43:50.335
[Gir and Trog laugh]

1:43:50.335,1:43:53.880
Gir: Yeah, that’s how I feel, too.

1:43:53.880,1:43:57.060
Baaulp: I’m a pretty competitive 
person, but I have to like, 

1:43:57.060,1:44:03.000
enjoy it. I-I was very uncompetitive in 
school but only because I was already being 

1:44:03.000,1:44:08.160
forced into so many competitive things 
that I was like, “Fuck this.” Like, now I 

1:44:08.160,1:44:12.360
like competitive video games, right? 
But like, back then it’s like, “I don’t 

1:44:12.360,1:44:14.640
want to do the science fair.” “Well you 
gotta do the science fair.” “I don’t want 

1:44:14.640,1:44:17.760
dance class.” “Well you gotta do dance 
class, and we’re also splitting you up 

1:44:17.760,1:44:20.400
into groups and you have to dance 
against each other,” It’s like—

1:44:20.400,1:44:22.500
Wayne: Well in dance class-in 
dance class you don’t get to 

1:44:22.500,1:44:24.810
hit the sick combos, so it’s not the same.

1:44:24.810,1:44:24.833
Baaulp, laughing: Yeah.

1:44:24.833,1:44:26.460
Wayne: Not the same as fighting games.

1:44:26.460,1:44:27.960
Gir: You were in a bad dance class, then.

1:44:27.960,1:44:31.560
Log: I remember back in our 
YouTube Poop Steam group, 

1:44:32.160,1:44:36.340
there-there was a guy, and I’m not even 
gonna like, even name names, but there 

1:44:36.340,1:44:40.680
was a guy that for whatever reason, just 
bought every game, and then on Christmas 

1:44:40.680,1:44:45.355
he had just like a Christmas art 
competition. I don’t know why he had that.

1:44:45.355,1:44:46.459
Gir: Oh, yeah! I forgot about that.

1:44:46.459,1:44:46.488
Wayne: [Unintelligible] That.

1:44:46.488,1:44:48.960
Log: And it was like, “Alright, 
alright, draw pictures and 

1:44:48.960,1:44:52.980
if you win we’ll give you games.” And 
I guess for whatever reason I was the 

1:44:52.980,1:44:57.780
only person in the entire group that 
like, actually decided tthat, “Oh, if I 

1:44:57.780,1:45:03.360
try, I’ll win a game,” and I did, and 
I drew a picture that I actually like, 

1:45:03.360,1:45:07.800
put some effort into, and naturally 
I’m the only person in the entire group 

1:45:07.800,1:45:10.674
that put any effort in and so 
I won the first prize [laughs].

1:45:10.674,1:45:13.966
Trog: Hey, you did it. Yeah, 
none of us were, y’know—

1:45:13.966,1:45:17.700
Log: But that like, barely counts—like you 
guys-like you guys were all going in there  

1:45:17.700,1:45:22.192
just like, you guys were all going in there 
trying to lose. So that barely even counts.

1:45:22.192,1:45:22.380
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:45:22.380,1:45:25.680
Trog: I mean it makes sense 
for that group of people, for 

1:45:25.680,1:45:27.521
that group of children, essentially.

1:45:27.521,1:45:27.534
Baaulp: Yeah.

1:45:27.534,1:45:29.280
Trog: That none of us would try.

1:45:29.280,1:45:34.020
Wayne: Hey, so I did find-I 
did find our podcast thumbnail 

1:45:34.020,1:45:38.160
picture in the Discord right there, but 
the picture also unlocked a memory of 

1:45:38.160,1:45:41.382
mine. Does Balloon Blast count as a contest?

1:45:41.382,1:45:41.395
Trog: It can.

1:45:41.395,1:45:44.332
Log: I don’t think so, I 
think it’s too small scale.

1:45:44.332,1:45:45.360
Baaulp: I think it’s a scam.

1:45:45.360,1:45:48.060
Wayne: I think if there’s four 
players it’s a contest, you’re 

1:45:48.060,1:45:48.946
competing with other children.

1:45:48.946,1:45:49.980
Baaulp: Okay. What about it?

1:45:49.980,1:45:52.380
Wayne: So I was playing Balloon 
Blast or an equivalent at a 

1:45:52.380,1:45:55.800
carnival, and I’ve told you guys this 
story before, but we were playing the 

1:45:55.800,1:46:00.000
game, and I won, and the-the reason 
that I was playing that game was because 

1:46:00.000,1:46:03.900
they had cool Sonic plushies, and that 
was fuckin’ rare that you would see that 

1:46:03.900,1:46:09.120
at a carnival, and you win, and the fuckin’ 
carnie comes over and he holds Sonic 

1:46:09.120,1:46:13.080
and Knuckles up to you and he says, “Do 
you want red Sonic or blue Sonic?” And 

1:46:13.080,1:46:14.021
I got so fuckin’ mad.

1:46:14.021,1:46:14.033
[Gir laughs]

1:46:14.033,1:46:16.620
Wayne: That’s bullshit, man.

1:46:16.620,1:46:18.300
Gir: “I want blue Knuckles!”

1:46:18.300,1:46:20.700
Wayne: “Do you want red 
Knuckles or blue Knuckles?”  

1:46:20.700,1:46:21.622
That’s even
funnier.

1:46:21.622,1:46:21.644
[Baaulp and Gir laugh]

1:46:21.644,1:46:24.480
Wayne: [Laughs] You don’t know 
Sonic, but you do know Knuckles.

1:46:24.480,1:46:27.660
Log: Against my better judgement, 
I still enter competitions. 

1:46:27.660,1:46:34.200
I’m in one right now, uh, if I win, you 
won’t hear the end of it, and if I lose, 

1:46:34.200,1:46:35.460
you won’t hear about it ever again.

1:46:36.960,1:46:38.872
[Everyone laughs]

1:46:38.872,1:46:40.140
Gir: Aw man, y’know, reflecting on  

1:46:40.140,1:46:42.224
all this has made me
realize something.

1:46:42.224,1:46:42.235
Trog: Mhmm.

1:46:42.235,1:46:44.100
Gir: When I was a kid,  

1:46:44.700,1:46:48.863
I constantly lied and cheated and
stole.

1:46:48.863,1:46:48.892
Wayne: I loved Balloon Blast.

1:46:48.892,1:46:50.700
Baaulp: Yeah, you were a bad kid!

1:46:50.700,1:46:51.469
Gir: I was a shit kid [laughs]!

1:46:51.469,1:46:53.080
Wayne: You were a bad boy.

1:46:53.080,1:46:57.918
Gir: But the best part is… I 
always got away with it [laughs].

1:46:57.918,1:46:58.200
Baaulp: Damn.

1:46:58.200,1:47:00.480
Trog: Well, you weren’t ever punished. Now  

1:47:00.480,1:47:01.260
that’s why you
stole a lot.

1:47:01.260,1:47:02.400
Gir: Nobody ever caught me!

1:47:02.400,1:47:07.200
Wayne: Okay, I’m not gonna go-I’m not 
gonna go into details, but I-for me,  

1:47:07.200,1:47:11.760
it’s the same way, until I did 
get caught. And then it was bad,  

1:47:11.760,1:47:14.985
but I won’t go into details 
because I can’t go into details.

1:47:14.985,1:47:17.640
Trog: [Laughs] It built up 
and-and you-you got all your 

1:47:17.640,1:47:19.590
negative karma out on the same instant.

1:47:19.590,1:47:22.860
Wayne: Yeah, and then my life’s 
been great since then! After 

1:47:22.860,1:47:24.360
I met those horrible consequences.

1:47:24.360,1:47:29.940
Gir: I-I stopped when, oh, you 
know what? No, there was one 

1:47:29.940,1:47:32.640
time where I got caught, and there 
were some pretty bad consequences.

1:47:32.640,1:47:35.460
Wayne: [Laughs] See? You always-you  

1:47:35.460,1:47:37.680
do always get caught! It
might not happen until like,  

1:47:37.680,1:47:40.080
sixteen years into your life, but you will get
caught.

1:47:40.080,1:47:42.420
Gir: Here’s the thing though, 
is I got caught, but that 

1:47:42.420,1:47:44.880
thing that I got caught doing, I ended up doing-I  

1:47:45.480,1:47:48.660
still do it to this day, uh, ‘cause
it’s piracy.

1:47:48.660,1:47:50.940
Wayne: Oh, did you get a notice from your ISP?

1:47:50.940,1:47:52.980
Gir: Because we lived in Germany,  

1:47:52.980,1:47:55.937
and we got a notice, and
it was a 900 Euro fine.

1:47:55.937,1:47:55.948
Trog: Damn.

1:47:55.948,1:47:55.973
Baaulp and Wayne: Oooooh.

1:47:55.973,1:47:58.020
Wayne: That sucks.

1:47:58.020,1:48:00.360
Gir: Yeah, uh,  

1:48:01.080,1:48:05.760
I did not like Eidos or Batman: Arkham Asylum
for a long time because of that.

1:48:05.760,1:48:06.656
[Trog and Wayne laugh]

1:48:06.656,1:48:10.260
Trog: Specifically—it’s not their fault you  

1:48:10.260,1:48:10.961
stole their
game!

1:48:10.961,1:48:10.975
[Wayne laughs]

1:48:10.975,1:48:15.120
Gir: I know! But because I 
downloaded Batman: Arkham Asylum 

1:48:15.120,1:48:18.600
from Pirate Bay, uh I got in big, big trouble.

1:48:18.600,1:48:22.071
Baaulp: We gotta wrap up 
soon, but I-I-I want to add my 

1:48:22.072,1:48:28.440
thing onto that. I think some—Looking 
back at my childhood, especially like in 

1:48:28.440,1:48:36.120
school, grade school taught me how to 
like, social engineer people. Like, I was 

1:48:36.120,1:48:42.180
not a troublemaker, but I loved just 
like, wandering around and like, in school 

1:48:42.180,1:48:47.760
you’re not supposed to do that, but like, 
I would-I like-at some point like, in 

1:48:47.760,1:48:51.720
grade school I just learned to play 
it cool, and just be like, “Oh no, I’m 

1:48:51.720,1:48:54.512
supposed to be here, this 
teacher told me to be here.”

1:48:54.512,1:48:54.532
Gir, laughing: Yeah!

1:48:54.532,1:48:57.240
Baaulp: Like I would just like, 
I would just like take the 

1:48:57.240,1:49:03.690
info I knew and like, corrobor—like, 
build these stories and like, it worked.

1:49:03.690,1:49:05.400
Gir: Nah, I did that shit, too.

1:49:05.400,1:49:09.180
Baaulp: I remember asking to 
go to the bathroom for a class 

1:49:09.180,1:49:12.642
and then just like, wandering around, and—

1:49:12.642,1:49:12.655
[Trog laughs]

1:49:12.655,1:49:14.940
Gir: Yeah, I did that in high school all the time!

1:49:14.940,1:49:17.820
Baaulp: Yeah! And like a teacher 
would stop me and be like—like 

1:49:17.820,1:49:20.040
I would go into classrooms and be like,  

1:49:20.040,1:49:22.735
“Oh, yeah, y’know, can I just
hang out in here [laughs]?”

1:49:22.735,1:49:25.200
Gir: Oh, you were one of the 
kids that would just go into a 

1:49:25.200,1:49:25.800
random class?

1:49:25.800,1:49:29.192
Trog: That’s so crazy. I 
couldn’t fathom ever doing that.

1:49:29.192,1:49:29.212
Gir: That’s funny.

1:49:29.212,1:49:32.340
Baaulp: This is not something I 
utilize as an adult and definitely  

1:49:32.340,1:49:35.935
not for nefarious purposes, but 
as a kid I did that all the time.

1:49:35.935,1:49:36.360
Gir: Definitely.

1:49:36.360,1:49:39.840
Baaulp: Dude, I got free 
McDonald’s one time ‘cause I 

1:49:39.840,1:49:42.960
met this kid, I think I’ve told this 
story, I met this kid at a park and was 

1:49:42.960,1:49:47.400
like, “Yo, what if—” And like, these 
were like, these were like definitely 

1:49:47.400,1:49:51.780
white, suburban parents who were like, 
“Ooh, it would be so cool if our son 

1:49:51.780,1:49:56.220
knew a first generation immigrant son,” 
and I knew that, so I was like, “Oooh,” 

1:49:56.220,1:50:00.480
and I hung out with this kid, I 
got free McDonald’s. I never-I—

1:50:00.480,1:50:03.480
Wayne: Baaulp, Baaulp, Baaulp. 
That makes perfect sense.

1:50:03.480,1:50:04.140
Trog: Yeah.

1:50:04.140,1:50:04.591
Gir: Yeah.

1:50:04.591,1:50:04.615
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:50:04.615,1:50:08.280
Gir: I did the same kind of 
shit though in high school where 

1:50:08.280,1:50:10.500
I would just be like, “Hey, I need to 
go to the bathroom, sign this bathroom 

1:50:10.500,1:50:14.940
pass for me?” It’s like, “Sure, okay.” 
I would leave the classroom and then I 

1:50:14.940,1:50:15.780
would just go for a walk.

1:50:15.780,1:50:17.640
Wayne: There were definitely 
a few kids in my life who I 

1:50:17.640,1:50:19.713
would hang out with just ‘cause 
they had good snacks at their house.

1:50:19.713,1:50:19.733
Gir: That’s funny.

1:50:19.733,1:50:23.280
Wayne: Like this one kid? He 
always had Dunkaroos. You think 

1:50:23.280,1:50:27.540
my mom would buy Dunkaroos? No. My mom 
and dad would never buy that fucking 

1:50:27.540,1:50:30.420
sugar trash. But this kid always had them.

1:50:30.420,1:50:32.700
Gir:  That’s like the
dork neighbor I had where  

1:50:32.700,1:50:35.640
I did not really like him, 
but I was friends with him 

1:50:35.640,1:50:40.620
because his dad could put cheats on my 
GameBoy, and because he-he and I would 

1:50:40.620,1:50:42.600
go to the pool, I would just 
go to the pool for free.

1:50:42.600,1:50:45.960
Baaulp: There was a-there was 
this—Oh my god. You guys aren’t 

1:50:45.960,1:50:50.460
gonna even believe me because this is like, 
such a weird thing. When I was a freshman 

1:50:50.460,1:50:57.780
in high school, there was a kid that I 
swear to god was the same age as us, but 

1:50:57.780,1:51:03.720
this kid had a f—this kid was like 
Russian, they had a full beard, and they 

1:51:03.720,1:51:08.160
always had fruit snacks. And it was 
dope, because he would always hand out 

1:51:08.160,1:51:11.760
fruit snacks. But he had a full beard, 
and we were all like, “How do you have a 

1:51:11.760,1:51:13.080
full beard?” And he was like, “I don’t know.”

1:51:13.080,1:51:15.526
Trog: [Laughs] He was scared of it.

1:51:15.526,1:51:18.960
Gir: [Laughs] I don’t know, 
this is scary. It won’t go away.

1:51:18.960,1:51:24.120
Wayne: Wait, wait. Hold on, 
I’m sorry. I zoned out, did you 

1:51:24.120,1:51:25.740
say that was like, a Halloween thing?

1:51:25.740,1:51:26.460
Baaulp: No.

1:51:26.460,1:51:27.225
[Gir laughs]

1:51:27.225,1:51:27.660
Baaulp: This—

1:51:27.660,1:51:30.780
Wayne: Who gave you—A bearded 
man gave you Fruit by the Foot 

1:51:30.780,1:51:31.560
on Halloween, right?

1:51:31.560,1:51:34.247
Baaulp: Yeah. Let’s-yeah, sure.

1:51:34.247,1:51:34.260
[Trog laughs]

1:51:34.260,1:51:37.860
Wayne: Do you guys have any 
scary Halloween stories? Not 

1:51:37.860,1:51:40.003
like-not like Jason, Friday the 13th—

1:51:40.003,1:51:40.014
Baaulp: No.

1:51:40.014,1:51:41.622
Trog: We have to end the podcast.

1:51:41.622,1:51:41.633
Baaulp: No.

1:51:41.633,1:51:41.668
Baaulp and Trog: We have to end it.

1:51:41.668,1:51:41.694
Baaulp: We have to end it!

1:51:41.694,1:51:44.580
Trog: It’s two hours.

1:51:44.580,1:51:48.060
Wayne: No, ‘cause you-‘cause 
you—‘Cause me mishearing what you 

1:51:48.060,1:51:50.880
just said reminded me of a time on 
Halloween where we went to this one guy’s 

1:51:50.880,1:51:53.340
house and the door was just open, 
and he was sitting in his living room 

1:51:53.340,1:51:56.420
watching TV and he told us to walk 
into the hallway to get the candy—

1:51:56.420,1:51:56.453
Gir: I had the same thing happen!

1:51:56.453,1:52:02.940
Wayne: And it was like-it was on the dresser 
and like, it’s probably not smart of us kids  

1:52:02.940,1:52:06.881
to do that, and we were definitely all freaked 
out, but we did do that, and he definitely—

1:52:06.881,1:52:08.100
Trog: ‘Cause the candy was more important.

1:52:08.100,1:52:12.900
Wayne: He definitely-‘cause 
it was like—He had good candy, 

1:52:12.900,1:52:17.400
he had like Crunch bars and shit, 
but like, it was very suspicious but 

1:52:17.400,1:52:21.480
we just like—and we all knew it, too, 
I think, like when we walked in, ‘cause 

1:52:21.480,1:52:24.480
we definitely did just walk in, we 
grabbed the candy bars, we just peaced the 

1:52:24.480,1:52:28.020
fuck out of there. It just-it wasn’t a 
malicious dude, it was just genuinely a lazy 

1:52:28.020,1:52:30.900
fuck who couldn’t be asked 
to give the kids the candy,  

1:52:30.900,1:52:33.000
he’d rather have them
walk into his home.

1:52:33.000,1:52:35.760
Gir: I had the same thing 
happen except it was—it wasn’t 

1:52:35.760,1:52:40.320
just us, it was us and our parents. Somebody 
was just in their living room watching 

1:52:40.320,1:52:43.740
TV and they’re like, “Yeah, just come 
in and get some candy.” It’s like, you 

1:52:43.740,1:52:45.840
can’t even be on the fuckin’ porch? Alright ma’am.  

1:52:45.840,1:52:49.652
Whatever. Nice place you got
here, bye. I couldn’t imagine.

1:52:49.652,1:52:51.960
Trog, in a sing-song voice: 
And that’s the end of our show.

1:52:51.960,1:52:54.360
Gir: I was gonna say, you know 
what else I couldn’t imagine? 

1:52:54.360,1:52:55.500
Ending this podcast.

1:52:55.500,1:52:58.409
Trog: I couldn’t imagine this 
podcast ending any sooner.

1:52:58.409,1:52:58.433
Baaulp: I’m so hungry!

1:52:58.433,1:53:00.420
Wayne: Chat if you’re listening-if  

1:53:00.420,1:53:01.920

episode on Halloween—

1:53:01.920,1:53:02.273
Gir: Yeah, chat.

Wayne: The-I do that all the time, you fuck.

1:53:04.931,1:53:05.456
[Gir and Trog laugh]

1:53:05.456,1:53:09.660
Wayne: If you listen to this 
episode on Halloween, the uh, 

1:53:09.660,1:53:13.620
we do have bowls of candy out 
for our listeners, my-if you, um—

1:53:13.620,1:53:14.610
Gir: One.

1:53:14.610,1:53:17.760
Wayne: One per listener. Don’t 
take any more than that, but 

1:53:17.760,1:53:22.195
I do have Mr. Goodbars if you want ‘em.

1:53:22.195,1:53:23.520
Gir: I like Mr. Goodbar.

1:53:23.520,1:53:24.720
Wayne: Well, you don’t get any,  

1:53:24.720,1:53:25.860
‘cause they’re for our
listeners.

1:53:25.860,1:53:26.850
Gir: I listened!

1:53:26.850,1:53:27.840
Wayne: That’s true.

1:53:27.840,1:53:30.900
Baaulp: Ayeee, what are we-what 
are we doing? Plug us. Plug 

1:53:30.900,1:53:31.680
our shit.

1:53:31.680,1:53:32.820
Wayne: We’re not done with the  

1:53:32.820,1:53:34.486
candy joke. You have to
finish the joke, first.

1:53:34.486,1:53:34.523
Trog: I’m done with the candy joke.

1:53:34.523,1:53:34.547
[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

1:53:34.547,1:53:36.840
Gir: Baaulp, we’re trying to tell a joke. You-you  

1:53:36.840,1:53:37.380
fucked it
up.

1:53:37.380,1:53:41.700

popped. I thought his popped! I
thought he made the pop sound!

1:55:35.880,1:55:37.080

next up: always-on livestream of all wdwb episodes with windows media player visualiser

was thinking of running it on the vm live, realised if I want to do the illuminati council thing I should pre-record it. for a single virtualiser I can run it live. take a poll what people like more?

NEED to record on obs with more bitrate. the fucking visualisers are huge bitrate eaters

todo
[ ] download all episodes. write a script to download them then attach the associated image to make video. may use lots of disk space
[ ] make transcripts into subtitles
[ ] run livesteam with visualiser
[ ] (maybe) figure out how to split speaker, make the illuminati real

AHAH:
0. I could search for something to segment audio by speaker. splitting crosstalk is not required.
2. REAL: I can use the transcripts! they're already captioned by name. I need to align the transcripts to timed text already anyway, for subtitles. eureeeek.

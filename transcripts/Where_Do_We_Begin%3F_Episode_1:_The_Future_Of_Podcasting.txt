Wayne: Hello and welcome to The Podcast #1: The Future of Podcasting. My name is Wayne.

Trog: My name is Trog.

Baaulp: I'm Baaulp.

Log: I'm Log!

Gir: I'm Gir.

Wayne: And today, we're gonna be doin' a podcast. It's the first... and the best... #1. And I think we have some things we're gonna talk about today. Some topics, some questions.

Log: You're really excited. I'm not talkin' to Wayne, I'm talkin' to you, the listener, [crosstalk] you're so excited.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Gir: You don't even realize it yet.

Baaulp: We live in your phone. I live next to your battery and I like to walk over past those capacitors there, close to where your phone speaker is, and hang out at my friend Wayne's place. We play video games on tiny consoles. Did anyone, like, do anything interesting these last few weeks, or play any games, or see any movies, or anything you wanna talk about?

Trog: [crosstalk] I did.

Log: No, next question.

Trog: What? No, I did. I did. Because I, over the last two weeks— no, less than that, over the last week, I watched EVERY English episode of Dragon Ball Super, and I think almost—

Baaulp: You just marathoned the whole thing, like the entirety of it?

Trog: I got up to like, I don't know, Episode 30, and then took a month break, and then came back and watched the next 40, [crosstalk] and my review? 

Baaulp: Damn.

Trog: Good. Good, although I don't know if its, like, ACTUALLY good, or if I just really like those characters. I'm not sure, I don't know.

Wayne: I love Dragon Ball Z, and I really like Dragon Ball Super, but Dragon Ball Super— I don't know about the manga, but as an anime—I was talking about this earlier—Dragon Ball Super, if it was not those characters but the same exact story, and the same exact story mechanics, it would suck. It'd be so bad, [crosstalk] it would be awful. It would be so bad.

Trog: Yeah, I kinda get that same feeling.

Baaulp: So I never watched any of Super, did they just phone it in or what?

Trog: No, no, no.

Wayne: [crosstalk] No, it's all Akira Toriyama.

Trog: It's good. It's all good. It's good, it's just like— it's good in that weird Dragon Ball campy-ness, I don't know, it's—

Wayne: Dragon Ball Z was already so heightened and like, where can you take it from there without it seeming like a fanfiction? 

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: That's kinda the problem that Dragon Ball Super has.

Trog: Exactly. It gets really silly in terms of all the power level stuff. They have to keep amping it up and stuff, and it gets kinda silly, but I think it's still good, and I still really like it, and I would definitely recommend it, but...

Wayne: So here's the synopsis to my new fanfiction, Dragon Ball Ultra, alright; Goku becomes so strong, now he's a god. And he fights a god, but he's not actually a god, it turns out. Goku's not actually a god, he just has god-like power levels. And then Frieza comes back from the dead and he's GOLDEN. And then Vegeta fights a ROBOT full of LAVA. AND THEN... and then GOKU—

Baaulp: Does that happen? Did he fight a robot full of lava?

Trog: Yes, he did.

Wayne: And then Evil Goku comes, and he KILLS CHICHI!

Gir: In that order.

Trog: You missed an important part, because everybody's favorite character, Future Trunks, comes back AGAIN for some reason—

Wayne: [crosstalk] And he can't do shit.

Trog: And THEN Evil Goku shows up.

Wayne: And he can't do shit, because Evil Goku is THOUSANDS of times stronger than Trunks.

Gir: I would like to touch on something real quick, uh, Trog.

Trog: What?

Gir: Why the fuck do you hate the Pilaf Gang so much?

Trog: I don't know—

Wayne: [crosstalk] They're annoying as shit!

Trog: Yeah, I just find them really annoying. 

Gir: They're not that bad!

Trog: Like, I don't get too bothered by filler but, yeah, I don't know. Something about any filler involving them just made me really upset. I think it's like... I don't know, they're just annoying, and useless, and you know that if they're in an episode, they're not gonna do anything. They're just gonna, like, yell, and be annoying.

Wayne: Yeah, it's also like, maybe it wouldn't be that bad, but they're there too much. They stop after a certain point but they will get, like, 5 minutes of an episode MULTIPLE times during an arc, [crosstalk] like in the Goku Black arc.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Any other interesting things happen to you this week, or topics you'd like to talk about? Oh, I have one actually. Or Log, you go first, since you were not involved in that conversation at all.

Log: Yeah, welcome to the official podcast— the Dragon Ball podcast you never knew about. 

Gir: It's gonna keep happening.

Log: Here's my Dragon Ball fact: last weekend I helped put up a fence. I've never done that before. It's really bad, actually, you shouldn't do it.

Wayne: You put it up from nothing? Like, you installed the whole thing?

Log: Well, there was a preexisting fence and it was bad. [crosstalk] So we had to—

Wayne: Was this a chain link fence, or was this a picket, wooden—

Gir: Yeah, I was about to ask.

Log: It's wooden.

Gir: Wood?

Baaulp: Wood.

Log: My grandpa found a good deal on these prebuilt sections of a wooden fence, so he bought like, 10, and just stacked them in the yard of my uncle's house. So today we decided—or not today—on the weekend, we decided to try and start putting up some of those things, knocking down the old shitty fence, and putting in the new wooden fence that was good. I don't like that. It's not— it doesn't work. You need two people to move the pieces of fence, right, so that's already bad. Y'know, wasps hang out there. [crosstalk] Dirt hangs out there.

Wayne: Oh my god. Wasps are like... I have a connection to this story in the summer that I painted my dad's wooden fence, and wasps were a big part of it. I'd say maybe 50% of my time painting that fence was spent avoiding wasps, and I fucking HATE wasps. They are my enemy.

Gir: Yeah, I got my first wasp sting in like... 15 years.

Baaulp: What did it feel like? I've never been stung by a wasp or a bee.

Gir: It felt like a hot needle being rammed into me.

Trog: You know how people would describe a pain as a stinging pain? That's where that comes from, Baaulp.

Wayne: That's why they say it's a bee sting.

Gir: The wasp's sting felt like a sting.

Baaulp: That's the basis? I'm surprised I haven't been stung by a wasp or anything, because I would hang out at my friend Spencer's house all the time [crosstalk] back in high school, and at the—

Trog: And cover yourself in maple syrup.

Wayne: And I'd roll around underneath the beehive, and they wouldn't even come get me.

Gir: I think they'd avoid you.

Baaulp: No, he just had a wasps nest at the very top of his house [crosstalk] that he could never get rid of.

Gir: That's where he kept it. He kept it there.

Trog: That he cultivated, raising wasps.

Wayne: He owned one, it was his— it was HIS wasp nest.

Trog: "Hey guys, wanna come over and see my cool wasp nest? I've been training them to attack."

Wayne: "You wanna see my wasp?"

Gir: "It makes this tight noise when I hit it."

Log: "I've raised them from birth, I know each one."

Trog: [crosstalk] "I'm the Wasp King."

Wayne: "Wanna come to my house and get stung?"

Trog: "My name is Tyler the Wasp King, and I will take over all of Boston."

Log: "Hey bro, you wanna do a wasp?"

Gir: He asked you to come over and get fucked up, but he meant get attacked by wasps.

Wayne: Alright, so I've got a tangent to take from this. So for those of you who are NOT Baaulp and HAVE been stung by bees, what is your worst bee sting story? Like, what's the worst— was there ever a time where it wasn't just ONE bee, have you ever had an encounter like that?

Baaulp: Oh my god, that's like straight out of RuneScape.

Gir: I didn't have multiple, but I did get stung right on my ass.

Trog: [crosstalk] How?

Gir: That sucked.

Trog: Why were your pants off?

Gir: [crosstalk] I don't— I was a kid and we were swimming

Wayne: Gir was mooning the bees.

Gir: Huhuhuh, check this out, little dumbasses.

Wayne: You started mooning the bees and immediately they beelined it for your ass.

Gir: Hey, that's that kids ass!

Wayne: We know that ass, [crosstalk] go get it!

Gir: We know that ass!

Log: It's like, y'know, the olden times where you'd get your cat mad at you, so he'll just take a wasp and put it underneath the cushion of your seat right as you're about to sit down.

Wayne: [crosstalk] What?

Gir: Was your cat Garfield?

Trog: Your cat?

Wayne: Was your cat sentient?

Baaulp: I don't think cats ever did that, and he's trying to make a reference to Tom and Jerry, so...

Log: Yeah, y'know, it's like back in those days where cats wore gloves all the time.

Gir: Oh...

Trog: Oh right, where all animals wore gloves.

Log: Yeah, and then you'd fly up and you'd take damage from both ends, [crosstalk] 'cause you get stung, and then you fly up out of your seat, and impact your skull on the ceiling—

Gir: And you go "AHHHH!"

Wayne: [crosstalk] How much damage?

Log: So it's like a double damage.

Wayne: How much?

Log: It's like double damage.

Gir: You get double donked.

Wayne: Alright, well, I have a bee story. So, when I was a kid I used to have to mow the lawn all the time, we had a really big lawn with many levels. It was a cool place.

Gir: You make it to Level 2?

Wayne: Yeah. We also used to have a lot of pool parties, and you know pool parties, you got the snacks, you got the soda, you got the soda can. And some people didn't like to clean up after themselves, so sometimes I'd find trash leftover from the party, and we'd have to clean it up. And one time I was mowin' the lawn, and I saw a can of Sprite laying down on the lawn, [crosstalk] and I was like, oh boy, a can of Sprite! 

Baaulp: Uh oh! 

Trog: I can't wait to drink this! 

Gir: Can't wait to drink this soda off the ground!

Baaulp: Oh tight, free Sprite!

Trog: So yummy!

Wayne: I cant wait to clean up this can and please my parents for being a good— doing a good job! And I picked it up, and underneath that can, I saw a hole in the ground, and I was like—

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Oh sick, free hole!

Wayne: Huh! I wonder what this hole is! And I stuck my head in— no, I didn't do that, [crosstalk] but I—

Trog: Ah, it's the Sprite hole.

Wayne: I observed the hole, and then I looked at the can after I heard a buzzing coming from the can. And you know how in the games, and the movies, and the cartoons, when you get stung by a bee, it's like a cloud of bees? 

Trog: Yeah.

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: That's what happened.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Cloud of bees.

Baaulp: Multiple bees came out?

Wayne: From the can. I think they were like, digger hornets or whatever, 'cause they were diggin' a hole—

Trog: That sucks.

Gir: [crosstalk] Those things hurt.

Wayne: Cloud of bees out of the hole, out of the can, and this is where my phobia of bees stems from.

Log: And then you became the bee boy.

Wayne: I ran away and sat in my house forever, and then I never went outside again.

Trog: Did you go out of your way to try to exact revenge against ALL stinging insects?

Wayne: Yeah, I mean, later on. And then— so, we also had a shed right next to that hole, and that shed was really, really old, and there was a lot of stuff in there that we didn't really use. Basically one half of the shed was dedicated to pool stuff that we put away in the winter, and the other half was dedicated to our tractor, and then there was other stuff in there that we didn't really touch. And we used the two shed doors that were like these big, bulky things that were giant, and then there was an actual house door on it, for some reason. We never used that house door. One day we decided to open it, and the fucking most— the biggest wasp nest was inside of it, and that was horrifying. But let me tell you, the feeling of using some Raid on that shit? Oh my god. Sweet, sweet revenge.

Log: Does anybody USE a shed? [crosstalk] I feel like everybody— 

Trog: Yeah. 

Baaulp: Yeah, it's a place to put stuff! What are you talkin' about?

Log: You have sheds in some houses around, y'know. Or in the backyards or whatever. I feel like sheds are predominately like a wildlife cultivation center, [crosstalk] more than a storage unit.

Wayne: They are! They absolutely are. They're a storage unit—

Log: I've never known somebody that actually uses their shed.

Wayne: It's complete risk/reward. The reward is you get to put your tractor in it, and the risk is that beavers— I mean... not beavers... 

Gir: Beavers...

Wayne: [crosstalk] Woodchucks!

Baaulp: Those beaver swarms, they make their nests everywhere! 

Wayne: Woodchucks will create a home under it, and wasps will take it over, and then you have to fight for your tractor.

Trog: Where else are you supposed to keep your wasps?

Gir: I'm the outlier where, when I was a kid, we had a shed, and it wasn't used for storage, it was just MY personal playhouse.

Trog: [crosstalk] That seems dangerous.

Wayne: That's not a shed, then.

Log: [crosstalk] Yeah, that's a playhouse.

Gir: It was a shed!

Wayne: My neighbors had that.

Log: Well, no, it's a playhouse, it's a playhouse...

Gir: No, it's a— you don't call a fuckin' aluminum-sided building in your backyard a playhouse, [crosstalk] it's a fuckin' shed.

Wayne: It's a playhouse.

Baaulp: Dude, you had a cool playhouse.

Wayne: Yes it is, a child plays in there!

Trog: Anything can be a playhouse.

Wayne: Yeah.

Gir: Pee-wee did not live in a shed.

Wayne: Whenever I take girls home, I get them out the car, and I say "Welcome to my playhouse, I play in here."

Trog: And then they leave.

Gir: And then they leave, yeah!

Wayne: [crosstalk] And then they leave!

Baaulp: Tekken 7.

Gir: [crosstalk] I have a tangent for your bug story, 'cause like being surrounded by—

Wayne: Did Baaulp just say Tekken 7?

Gir: I hope so.

Baaulp: Yeah, you said playhouse, you play Tekken 7 there!

Trog: If you listen carefully—

Wayne: [crosstalk] You play a lot of games in here.

Log: We drop all kinds of references in this one.

Trog: If you listen carefully in this podcast— 

Wayne: Undertale.

Trog: Baaulp will just be saying the names of video games, and if you write them all down and send them in, you'll win a sweepstakes.

Log: Pokémon Blue.

Gir: We'll make fun of you.

Wayne: The Banner Saga. The Banner Saga 2. [crosstalk] The Banner Saga 3.

Gir: But yeah, your cloud of bugs story—

Log: Frostpunk.

Gir: —reminded me of when I was a child. When I was a kid, I liked trying to get lizards. I liked to pick up the lizards, you know what I mean?

Trog: Hell yeah, man! [crosstalk] I liked to pick up lizards, if you know what I'm sayin'.

Gir: You know what I'm sayin'?

Wayne: [crosstalk] YEAH, LIZARD COLLECT. LIZARD GET.

Gir: But here's the thing—

Baaulp: I don't know why, but I like to imagine that they wouldn't run from you [crosstalk] and you would just pick them up nonchalantly.

Gir: They would, and I'd have to chase them.

Wayne: They didn't want to be picked up.

Gir: There was one time where I noticed a snake, and I knew that the snakes in the area were... safe, they were like garden snakes. But I went to go get it, and I reached my hand into the hole that it went into, like "Ah man, this is a deep hole, I can't find that snake!". I pulled my hand back out, my hand is not my hand anymore. It is now a mass of ants in the shape of my hand.

Wayne: You dumbass!

Trog: Why did you stick your hand in a hole!? [crosstalk] When has that ever worked out for anyone?

Gir: I wanted that snake, man!

Baaulp: Hold on, I just realized something. What is with you guys and sticking your hands in holes [crosstalk] and picking up random cans of Sprite?

Wayne: I didn't stick— okay, in my hole story, I didn't stick my hand in the hole. [crosstalk] That was a joke.

Gir: I didn't know there were ants in the hole, I thought it was just like a hole and some rocks.

Wayne: How old were you? 

Trog: Why don't you guys in the comments tell us your favorite hole story, [crosstalk] let us know what weird holes you've stuck your appendages in.

Gir: I didn't know there was ants in there, I just knew there was a snake in it!

Log: I didn't know there were ants in there. [crosstalk] I was just gonna reach into the snake hole!

Gir: Look, look look, don't question the—

Log: I was only intending to fish in the snake hole!

Wayne: I didn't know there was piss in the bottle, I thought it was a free drink!

Gir: That's... way different.

Wayne: Yes it is, [crosstalk] you thought there was a free snake in the hole!

Gir: Yes, it is different, thank you for agreeing!

Wayne: You thought there was a free snake in the hole, and you stuck your hand in there!

Gir: Don't question the logic of a child, my man.

Wayne: You should have been older.

Gir: You know what, you're right.

Log: [crosstalk] Where do I begin?

Gir: Fuck you.

Baaulp: I have my own story, and then I think we can move onto something else. I was like, maybe 7, or like 6 years old—

Wayne: Should've been older.

Baaulp: Me and my neighbor were hangin' out and we were eating Go-Gurt on the steps to the apartment.

Trog: Then Tyler came by and was like, "Hey, check out all these wasps I collected!"

Wayne: "Check out all these holes in my yard!", and he put his hand down and he got sucked in.

Log: "Hey, I got a snake down this hole over here."

Baaulp: I thought it was a Go-Gurt hole!

Gir: When a Go-Gurt comes out of its hole, you get seven weeks of summer.

Baaulp: No joke, we were eating Go-Gurt, and then we started— we were just talking to each other, but then we started feeling itchy and then we looked down, and at some point from under us—we were just sitting on some steps—once a year, ant colonies will have mating flights, where they'll actually give birth to reproductive males and females, and they'll have wings, and they'll fly? And so ants just start swarming around us, and they started flying, and I didn't know that as a kid, I didn't know ants could have wings! So we start freaking the fuck out, and we ran away.

Trog: They wanted your Go-Gurt.

Wayne: EDF Origins.

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: We didn't know ants had wings! We were legitimately scared.

Trog: Hey, I didn't know ants could have wings until you just told me right now, so...

Baaulp: Really?

Wayne: [crosstalk] I knew that.

Gir: Really?

Trog: I didn't know that.

Gir: Goodness. How do you think they get around so easy?

Trog: I stay indoors.

Log: How's a winged ant know how to do anything? They like, count their steps to figure out how to get home.

Gir: Nature.

Baaulp: What?

Gir: What?

Log: Yeah, that's how they do it.

Baaulp: Whatever, I don't—

Gir: [crosstalk] They count their wing beats.

Wayne: Ants don't know math!

Gir: Ants is fuckin' dumb!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, ants are pretty dumb, huh?

Wayne: Counting is math, and ants cant do that.

Baaulp: Yeah

Trog: Welcome to Bugcast.

Wayne: Ants are so dumb, if a certain ant dies, they all just start walking in circles until THEY die, they can't count!

Trog: Yeah, it's beautiful.

Gir: If you crush an ant, it dies, it's pathetic.

Baaulp: Ants have, what, [crosstalk] like 5 brain cells?

Wayne: WEAK. You counted them?

Gir: You looked really hard.

Baaulp: THEY did.

Trog: They counted them.

Wayne: THEY did, THEY counted them!

Trog: And they told me, they let me know.

Gir: I looked down at an ant, and it said, "Hey, bro."

Log: Yeah, they buzzed down into my ear and said "I have 5 of them!"

Gir: "We got 5!"

Trog: "Can I have your Go-Gurt now?"

Baaulp: Besides our various encounters with bugs these last few days, [crosstalk] anything else happen?

Gir: YOURS.

Wayne: Well, something funny happened at work. I told you guys about it already, but the viewers could hear it, [crosstalk] and then you guys could tell your retail stories.

Baaulp: I don't think I know this story.

Wayne: Well, the other day, I was at my retail job at an undisclosed location, I don't know where it is.

Baaulp: Undisclosed company.

Trog: Denny's.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Dark company.

Wayne: Yes, undisclosed company. 

Gir: Denny's.

Wayne: I do work at a pet store, [crosstalk] and my job for the day--

Trog: Denny's for Pets.

Wayne: At least during that hour, at Denny's for Pets, I was the cashier. Near the cash register, we sell dog toys, and y'know, in a store, customers are gonna be there. Customer walks up, 60 year old man. He's in a red shirt. He walks up to the table with dog toys and starts shopping very intently, he's very focused. And generally, if I see a customer who's not actively looking for help, or they look like they're very engaged in the product, I'm not gonna say anything to them. I'm not gonna greet them, or say "Hey, I can ring you out over here!" 'cause they're still shopping. So this dude, he's at the dog toy table, which is about 10 feet away from me. Can see him in plain sight. He picks up a stick. It's like a stuffed lion, but it's in the shape of a stick, it's a squeaky toy. He picks it up, he looks at me, he looks back down at the toy. Squeaks it ten or twelve times, looks back up at me, smiles, squeaks it a few more times, and he walks out the door. With the lion in his hands. And store policy for theft is that you're supposed to try and get their attention and try to stop them from going outside, but once they go outside, you cannot leave the store anymore, because then you are in danger. In this situation, I was so bewildered by this man's, like, obvious lack of stealth and lack of CARE for being stealthy while stealing this dog toy, that I just didn't say anything, I didn't think to. And then by the time he walked out the door, I just sort of followed him and looked outside, and I saw him just walk out to his car and he was just holding it up to his chest, and then he got in his car and drove away.

Trog: See, I love that story, and let me tell you why. Because now, I feel like I can steal anything. [crosstalk] I feel like all you need—

Gir: You just have to bewilder everyone.

Trog: You just need confidence. This just tells me that all you need in life is enough confidence, and you can pull off anything. You can just shoplift, it doesn't matter. [crosstalk] It's all yours.

Log: And also an item that you can pick up and take without it setting off alarms.

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, that also helps.

Wayne: Yeah, that too. That's the one limitation.

Baaulp: I'm gonna go up to a fuckin' general and just be like, "Oh, can I see your shiny nuclear launch key?", and I'll jingle it to distract him and walk away with it.

Log: Maybe you have to be able to squeak your theft item.

Gir: Yeah, that's the secret to it.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] You have to squeak it.

Trog: Yeah, as a distraction.

Baaulp: Maybe it's not even the squeak, maybe it was just squeezing it.

Baaulp: I'll just order chicken nuggets, and I'll take one out and I'll squeeze it, and then I'll walk away without paying.

Wayne: It was just, like, obviously he was right in front of me, obviously he was right there, I could see him. But it was the fact that we made EYE CONTACT and he smiled. 

Trog: 'Cause he knew!

Wayne: Like what Trog was saying, the confidence, the raw confidence, just like, "Yeah, this things mine." [crosstalk] I'm gonna go outside—

Trog: He knew.

Gir: "It's mine now, you little punk!"

Wayne: I'm gonna go outside and I'm gonna hug it in the parking lot, and I'm gonna show it to my wife, then we're gonna get in the car and drive away [crosstalk] while the cashiers looking.

Baaulp: Did he do that?

Wayne: Yes, he did.

Baaulp: Are you serious?

Wayne: Yes, he did.

Baaulp: I have a friend who is a butcher, [crosstalk] and he told me about this couple—

Wayne: He loves stealing lion toys.

Baaulp: What?

Gir: He loves turning old and stealing.

Wayne: Go.

Baaulp: No, he told me about this couple who are VERY well off, and he's like, they're very well off because they just chit-chatted, and the guy's like a lawyer or something. Clearly doesn't need to steal, but still tries to steal meat from the meat department at the grocery store he works at. And he assumes that they do it for the thrill of it, because—

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: No, that's why they're well off. They steal their meat, they don't have to pay for it.

Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

Trog: Meat makes up 80% of the average American spenditures, annually, so—

Baaulp: Help me balance my budget, please.

Gir: That's how he's frugal, he doesn't buy his meat, [crosstalk] he fucking steals it.

Wayne: 70k a year on meat.

Trog: I have a question for everybody, and y'know, considering the idea of statue of limitations and anything, have you ever stolen anything from a store?

Wayne: [crosstalk] Absolutely.

Gir: Absolutely.

Trog: Wow.

Log: Not a store.

Wayne: Not a store?

Trog: 100%, I cannot think of anything I've ever stolen, you all are psychopaths.

Wayne: I was a fucking, okay—

Gir: I haven't stolen since I was a child.

Wayne: I wasn't stealing video games, I wasn't stealing large food items, [crosstalk] me and my friends when we were in—

Trog: You were stealing diamonds.

Wayne: Me and my friends when we were in middle school and high school, we were just little fuckin' assholes, [crosstalk] we really were—

Baaulp: You guys were bad boys!

Gir: Punk ass motherfuckers.

Wayne: We would go to this shitty grocery store where none of the workers cared about anything—

Gir: So just all grocery store workers.

Wayne: We would just open boxes of Oreos and eat them—

Gir: Oh, you're that little fucker I hate!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] You guys are fuckin' bad boys!

Wayne: We used to take Hubba Bubba and chew it up, [crosstalk] and then put it back on the shelves.

Trog: And spit it on the ground.

Gir: Oh, you motherfucker.

Wayne: No, no no no no, we didn't do that.

Trog: [crosstalk] Put it back in the container.

Gir: I would've kicked your punk ass.

Wayne: We did take gum, but we didn't do that. I did, on two or three occasions, we opened an Oreo or a Chips Ahoy, and we had a few and put it back.

Gir: I hate you.

Wayne: Which, in retrospect, yes. That was awful. 

Log: Put you in a hole.

Wayne: That was really bad, especially for the poor woman that would buy those for their child.

Gir: Probably some old grandma was like, "I got you some Chips Ahoy!" and the kids like "Grandma, there's no fucking cookies in here!"

Trog: "It's full of chewed gum!"

Baaulp: [crosstalk] "Oh no, I'm gonna cry now!"

Wayne: There was a deli—

Gir: "You gonna cry now, you little bitch?"

Log: Well now, hold on, though. You're taking the cookies out of the bags and eating them, and then putting them back, but who's gonna get tricked by your [crosstalk] shitty cookie mess?

Wayne: It wasn't a prank, we were just hungry!

Log: Yeah, I'm saying, [crosstalk] who's gonna—

Gir: Old people! Old people!

Log: Nobody's gonna buy it, you're not gonna get fooled! 

Wayne: That's not the point!

Log: It's not like Wayne was a little 7 year old carrying around a heat sealer, "Oh, I'll just reseal the bag!"

Gir: You realize that those things look fine.

Wayne: Oreos and Chips Ahoy have that special system where you open it from the top, and then you put it back, and it reseals itself.

Trog: Yeah, you open up the top.

Gir: Yeah, that special system where there's glue on it.

Trog: Yeah, the secret cookie glue.

Log: They didn't have that back then!

Gir: Yeah, they did.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, they didn't have that back then.

Log: They definitely didn't.

Trog: Yeah, they did.

Wayne: They absolutely did! This was when I was in high school and middle school, [crosstalk] they absolutely did!

Gir: So 5 or 6 years...

Log: You were in high school!? I assumed you were 7!

Trog: If he was 7, how would he get to the store!?

Log: [crosstalk] He would walk, I dunno!

Gir: His mom took him.

Wayne: We just didn't give a shit! Okay, and here's our logic, we only did this at this one really shitty grocery store where the managers were assholes, and all the workers didn't give half a shit, so like, no harm done! And also, I regret this. That's the other thing. [crosstalk] No harm done, I regret this!

Trog: Just thought I should throw that part in, pretty important.

Wayne: Well, 'cause I shouldn't have been stealing, [crosstalk] because I was just an asshole teenager!

Trog: In case the FBI is listening.

Gir: Here's the thing, is I stole when I was a child—

Wayne: I'm sorry, FBI!

Gir: I stole when I was a child, but I just stole a video game cheat magazine.

Wayne: That's even— that's so much worse.

Gir: So it was like 7— yeah, okay.

Baaulp: What game was it for?

Wayne: [crosstalk] James—

Gir: It was for all games, it was a 7 dollar, [crosstalk] here's all these game systems, here's all the cheat codes for these games.

Trog: Oh, yeah, I've had one of those before. Back before the internet, yeah.

Wayne: ALL games? Oh my god. You stole the magazine with cheat codes for ALL games EVER?

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: That was so expensive.

Gir: It was pretty epic.

Wayne: That was like a 300 dollar magazine.

Baaulp: He just said it was 7 dollars!

Gir: It was 7 dollars. I went there, [crosstalk] okay—

Wayne: Here's why you should regret your actions.

Gir: I do! Actually, I don't.

Wayne: James. James, 8 years old. Couldn't beat Finding Nemo. Needed the infinite lives cheat. [crosstalk] You took the last one.

Gir: There was another copy, I didn't take the only one.

Wayne: Well no, you took that one, and then someone else took the other one.

Gir: Well, that's his fucking problem, [crosstalk] he should've got there sooner.

Wayne: He never beat Finding Nemo!

Gir: Nobody likes Finding Nemo, that game sucked!

Wayne: I'm using Finding Nemo on the GameCube, because I remember I had a cheat code book, and that was one of the first things in it for some reason.

Gir: I had Finding Nemo on the GameCube, and that game was a pile of shit.

Trog: Yeah, that game was really bad.

Gir: It was so fucking bad.

Wayne: Games not having cheat codes where it's just pressing a sequence of buttons at the main menu anymore is a fucking tragedy.

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, they need to bring that back.

Gir: Yeah, it's a travesty.

Baaulp: Well, that's DLC now!

Wayne: I know. It literally was! What was that game that had DLC where it was like, "Oh, cheat code DLC!", [crosstalk] and it—

Gir: Saints Row.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Was that Saints Row?

Trog: Was that Saints Row?

Log: Dead Rising, I think.

Wayne: That was some bullshit. Yeah, Dead Rising as well. 

Trog: What the hell, really?

Gir: Still bought it.

Wayne: Dead Rising and Saints Row both had that.

Trog: I did not know that.

Baaulp: I am a good boy, I did not steal, but I will say this. I just remembered this, I might be a good boy, but I might've been a dark boy, because I did not steal, but man—

Gir: Did I murder!

Baaulp: This one time I pulled some, like, on the verge of almost being a little psychopath. Because I was playing in the park, it was just me and my parents, they took me to the park—

Baaulp: There was a family there that looked much more well off than me, and the concept of pen pals was just introduced to me. This was back before most people— or, a lot of people had internet, so if you wanted to talk to someone you either called them or sent them an old-fashioned letter. And I was like, "I know what a pen pal is, I know what to do!" Fast forward, this kids parents are buying me McDonald's because they think I'll be this kids pen pal, [crosstalk] and I'm pretty sure they gave me their address and the kids name, and I threw the paper away later.

Trog: What the fuck?

Wayne: What?

Trog: What?

Gir: Nice.

Wayne: I don't understand this story, [crosstalk] I don't understand why your—

Gir: That's more a fault of the parents than you.

Wayne: I don't get this at all.

Baaulp: I manipulated them into getting me free food.

Wayne: Yes, but why did they buy you McDonald's because you were the kids pen pal? A pen pal is just—

Baaulp: Because they thought that kid was gonna get a— okay. I talked to them, I remembered them being from out of the city, and they thought their kid was gonna get a cool Asian pen pal friend, and become more worldly, and I took advantage of their hospitality and their hope, and I threw that paper in the fucking trash when they weren't looking.

Gir: [crosstalk] That's more taking advantage of them being dumb.

Trog: Honestly, I really like that story. 

Wayne: [crosstalk] It's really good.

Trog: That reminds me of something really fucking dumb me and my friends used to do as small-ish children, probably like, y'know, 8 to 10 years old. We used to just ride our bikes and wait for a car to drive by, and then pretend to crash and see if we could get them to stop and ask if we were alright. 

Gir: [crosstalk] That's pretty good.

Trog: Looking back on it now, I can't fathom why we thought this would be interesting, but for some reason, it was like, if we could pretend to crash on our bikes good enough to get a car to stop and be like "Hey, are you okay?", then it was great.

Wayne: Trog, you were doing insurance fraud as a child.

Trog: Yeah. [crosstalk] Well no, because we weren't running into the cars.

Gir: They weren't running into the cars!

Baaulp: No, they weren't crashing into the car, they were crashing into each other!

Trog: We weren't running into each other!

Wayne: Have you seen those insurance fraud videos, though? 

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: You don't need to touch the car, you can just fall over near it and expect money from them.

Trog: All we were doing, we were riding our bikes, and then we'd just fall to the side onto grass. And thinking back on it now, I realize how fucked up that is, because whenever I'm driving and I see any child on the sidewalk, I'm in full-on panic mode, because I'm like, "Kids are fucking dumb. If he decides to run into the street and I can't stop my car fast enough, my life is over."

Wayne: I have nightmares about that shit. But what I was gonna say, did any cars ever stop?

Trog: I think like, one, ever.

Wayne: And what happened?

Trog: What do you think happened? They stopped, they said "Hey, are you okay?", and I was like "Nah, I'm good." and they're like "Okay." and they drive away!

Wayne: There's another outcome to that, though. They could've been pissed! They could've been fucking furious at you!

Gir: "Why are you kids hurtin' yourselves, you little fucks?"

Wayne: Like Rocco— Like fuckin' Mega64, Rocco Botte, he told a story at some point about when he was a kid, he used to take toy M16's and shoot at cars with them.

Trog: [crosstalk] Oh god. That's different, that's way different.

Gir: That's so, so fucking reckless.

Wayne: Well yes, and he's also from a different generation than us, where that was [crosstalk] those kinds of toys were more—

Gir: Not acceptable, ever.

Wayne: Well yeah, [crosstalk] but more realistic gun toys were available.

Trog: But won't land you in jail.

Wayne: Well he was a child, he was like 8.

Gir: [crosstalk] Kid jail.

Wayne: Talking about doing shitty stuff near roads as a kid, like crashing your bikes. When I was in like sixth grade, I did something that could've gotten someone killed, and I have no clue why I did it. 

Wayne: I took a big ass rock, like a rock maybe the size of a basketball and a half, [crosstalk] I just put it in the middle of the road.

Gir: What the fuck?

Trog: What the hell?

Gir: Oh, I thought you were gonna say you threw it at a car [crosstalk] as it was passing.

Trog: Threw it at somebody!

Wayne: Oh, no! No, I put it in the middle of the road, which is arguably more dangerous.

Trog: Yeah.

Gir: Okay, 'cause when I was 8, that's what I did, was we took pebbles, and we'd throw 'em as cars were going by.

Wayne: Oh my god.

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, I was a little shithead.

Trog: That's not bad. That's not unusual.

Gir: [crosstalk] It wasn't bad until I learned—

Wayne: It's not bad, but I just imagine it actually happening, [crosstalk] where you ding a car and fuck it up.

Gir: Yeah, no, that's what happened is one day I finally discovered the concept of leading your shot, and I hit a car, and they immediately hit their fucking brakes, and I RAN.

Wayne: Hold on, how old were you?

Gir: Like 8.

Baaulp: 18.

Wayne: And you didn't understand— 18...

Trog: I was 22!

Gir: [crosstalk] 7 or 8.

Wayne: When I was 22, I found out the concept of leading my shot! [crosstalk] That's what I was laughing at.

Gir: Yeah, it was like 7 or 8.

Wayne: I feel like even when I was a kid, I found out— I would know that you wouldn't throw at it the moment you saw the car in front of you.

Gir: Well, you had video games. We couldn't afford video games, so I threw rocks at cars.

Wayne: That's not a thing that video games have to teach you!

Gir: Yes it is.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Did you ever play catch?

Baaulp: Did you ever throw a ball?

Gir: No.

Wayne: Did you ever play catch with a moving target?

Gir: No. [crosstalk] My targets all stood still.

Trog: This just reminds me of the scene from The Good Son where Home Alone throws a dummy—

Baaulp: Wait, sorry, I have to interrupt you. You said everything was still, like no one moved— 

Gir: Yeah.

Baaulp: You ever played basketball?

Trog: No.

Gir: No. 

Baaulp: Everyone just stands still?

Gir: When I was 8, no, I had not played basketball.

Wayne: And no one had run before. [crosstalk] None of my friends had moved.

Gir: Nobody had ever.

Log: We're gonna put Gir and Wayne away.

Gir: I don't wanna go away.

Trog: Forever.

Wayne: Why?

Log: You've done too much.

Trog: Yeah, you guys, [crosstalk] this is actually a sting operation.

Log: The proof has been given.

Wayne: I have another story about how I slashed a cars tires.

Trog: Woah, what the fuck?

Gir: [crosstalk] I have another story about how my friend almost burned his house down.

Wayne: No, I'm making jokes about crime, it didn't actually happen.

Trog: Crime jokes.

Log: Yeah, y'know— man, I gotta talk shit about something that I remember from years ago. Y'know how they got fuckin' blogs out there that are all about roleplaying as a shoplifter?

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: Yes.

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: Oh yeah, yep.

Log: It makes me— it confuses me that somebody would roleplay as a shoplifter to begin with, 'cause there's no thrill to it if you're not actually doing it, right? [crosstalk] Like, what's the point?

Baaulp: Well, the thrill comes from making people online THINK you're a shoplifter, I guess.

Log: But also the second thing that makes me mad at it, is that they call it "lifting". And all of their titles are like, "Lifting Master" and "Lifting Queen" and stuff.

Wayne: Well that's 'cause they don't want it to be like, actually— people think that they're doing illegal shit.

Log: "Ey, I lifted two lobsters from the grocery store today!" [crosstalk] "Lifting King!"

Wayne: It's like, "Alright, I'm gonna roleplay as a murderer, what do I call it?" [crosstalk] "Ah shit, I can't say that I'm murdering people on my blog!"

Gir: "Did some murd' today."

Wayne: "I did some— I durged somebody today."

Log: "I did some slang today."

Trog: "Hey what's up, it's me masterslayer49, and I'm gonna show you how to get 99 Runecrafting in 4 months."

Wayne: Alright, what's step one?

Trog: Quit your job, number one. Number two, sell all your worldly possessions except for a computer and an internet connection, and never sleep.

Wayne: Leave enough money to fund food for a year.

Trog: You don't need food.

Baaulp: Only lasagna, and water, and bread.

Wayne: No, and degreased pizza!

Gir: Number three, once you get all that Runecrafting, go ahead and give me your login information.

Wayne: I can verify that you have 99 Runecrafting, [crosstalk] you won't know.

Trog: Only I can get 99 Runecrafting, you have to give your account to me [crosstalk] and I will unlock it.

Gir: You can only make it to 98.

Wayne: That last level, 98 to 99, is impossible. Once you hit 98, I need your info.

Gir: [crosstalk] But I know a guy.

Wayne: But I also need your credit card number to fund membership.

Gir: I know a guy who can do it.

Trog: Talking about crime and shit, I've never stolen anything, but I've definitely tried to scam people on RuneScape when I was like 7, is that the same?

Gir: No.

Baaulp: Yeah. Yes, that's even worse.

Trog: Not 7, I guess I was like 10.

Wayne: I scammed people all the time on Maplestory. Maplestory used to have one of the dumbest things ever, which was fame, and fame was just like, once a day, you could click an arrow on someone's profile, and it would make a number go up for fame. And for some reason, people would just buy it for 20k, 'cause I think certain armor types, you needed Fame to wear it. Which is ridiculously dumb. So yeah, you would just say, like, "Oh, selling Fame, 15k." and get someone to give you 15k and then [crosstalk] not upvote.

Trog: Not do it.

Baaulp: Yeah, there's no way to verify it. Also, I distinctly remember passing by one person in an area where we were the only two people there, and we were literally just walking opposite directions, and just to be cheeky I clicked the down arrow. They noticed, and they immediately started following me [crosstalk] and yelling at me.

Wayne: How did they notice? Did they have their profile open?

Log: It tells you whenever you get defamed.

Wayne: Oh yeah, it does, it does. It did, at least.

Log: That was a really poorly thought out decision on their part. Maybe it's different in Korea, but here in the Wild Wild West, you were just hunting in that fucking Ludibrium Party Quest entrance for people with exactly 20 fame and the 20 fame requirement gear on, so you can just fucking obliterate them instantly.

Gir: I never played RuneScape, so—

Wayne: Wait, wait, wait, wait, really, was that a—

Log: Yeah, you didn't played RuneScape?

Trog: That was Maplestory, but—

Gir: It's the same thing to me.

Wayne: Log, I need you to elaborate a little bit. So you would bring them into the Party Quest and defame them so that their armor would come off?

Log: No, like the entrances, right? You got the Lubridium Party Quest, or the Monster Carnival, or whatever, right? 

Wayne: Uh huh. Yeah, yeah.

Log: There's just huge hordes of people in front of the entrance to the zone that everyone went to. You just click on a guy, "Oh, what's that? Got 20 fame?" [crosstalk] "You've got the Shadow gear?"

Wayne: It would make their clothes eject, literally?

Log: Yeah, you'd just hit that button and go, "YEAH! YEAH! YES!"

Trog: I did not know that that was a system— tying armor to something that other players can affect, that's wild!

Log: Yeah, that's why automated reporting systems are a bad idea, Blizzard and DotA 2 and all them. Yeah, you think that people won't abuse that? People always go, "Oh, I bet you were doin' something bad if you got banned." But man, if you were a kid and you played Maplestory, you know what its like to just be able to destroy somebody with the click of a button. And you won't be responsible. That's just a fact.

Trog: Yeah, exactly. It's not a victimless crime, it's a— you'll never get caught.

Log: Also, I wanna talk about that... I guess more visible example of the modern age, that Rainbow 6 Siege instant ban filter.

Trog: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, that's great.

Wayne: That's what I was gonna bring up.

Log: Just tricking people into saying the wrong words until they lose. [crosstalk] You just get a free win in ranked because you tell somebody to spell "grabbing" backwards, or something.

Trog: You just bait racism!

Wayne: Wait, spell "grabbing" backwards? What is that?

Log: Yeah, because if you spell it backwards, it trips off some meme swear.

Wayne: Oh, with the double B?

Log: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: And it will ban you.

Trog: I will say, though, I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing, but I wish every video game I played would just ban someone instantly for saying a racial slur.

Wayne: Oh absolutely. That's a good thing, why would you not want that in any game? I think Siege is like, the best game ever for adding that.

Log: It's not good if you take the game seriously, because if Tanner the 12 year old boy gets— [crosstalk] on your team, gets tricked into saying a word—

Trog: Gets baited. Gets racism baited.

Log: Yeah, gets tricked into being racist, then you're just down a player and you lose!

Wayne: I think, for me, the pleasure of seeing that person endure that punishment is good enough, [crosstalk] I think I would care about that more than winning the game.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: No, it's the difference between— like, yes, if somebody is saying it on purpose, but Log is describing a young person, not, like—

Wayne: Oh, being tricked into doing it?

Trog: Yeah, literally being tricked into it.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Well, I think that's funny.

Trog: It is funny.

Log: "Hey, what's the name of Cartman's superhero form?"

Wayne: Yeah, yeah.

Log: "How do you spell 'grabbing" backwards?" "Hey man, I noticed that you're a Spanish speaker, what's the name of that skin, Black Ice?"

Wayne: Black Ice!?

Trog: I don't know what that one is.

Log: Well, it's because it's an English word filter for a multinational game, [crosstalk] and—

Trog: Oh.

Wayne: Yeah.

Log: You know how to say "black" in Spanish.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Trog: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Wayne: So, the one thing I do like about this now, is envisioning this in a physical sense, of like, let's say that this is a net café, and all the people— all 10 people playing Siege are in the same room. I just imagine a turret on the ceiling, that someone types one of these words, they're vaporized instantly.

Gir: I like the concept, more, that they just go *pop* and they're gone.

Trog: Disappear.

Baaulp: I walk in, I say "Hey everybody, don't be racist!" and it just empties.

Wayne: Okay, that's the best trigger. It's one thing to trick a child into doing it, but the fact that it's like— people have just said "Don't be racist." and someone says a racist slur in response to that? [crosstalk] That's the best way to get someone banned.

Baaulp: Immediately gets banned.

Gir: That is a really good trick.

Log: That's pretty good, that's pretty good. But yeah, y'know, you talk about internet cafés, those things kinda have their own sorta setting for that. Like, you go into a South American arcade, or internet café, or something, you see a KOF machine, you're gonna see a sign that says "If you pick Omega Rugal, somebody's gonna fight you in real life."

Wayne: Hang on, is this real?

Log: I mean, that's just how it is in some of these arcades and stuff. It's like, "Oh yeah, I'll fuck you up if you grab me! If you pick Omega Rugal, you're as good as dead."

Wayne: Oh, I remember hearing stories about that! And like Street Fighter 2 and shit.

Baaulp: Yeah, arcades were freaking NUTS!

Trog: Because you're paying real money!

Baaulp: They had house rules for a lot of arcades!

Log: [crosstalk] There's a news story—

Wayne: "Use grabs, you fuckin' pussy!"

Log: There's a news story a while back, after— because there's an arcade in China, where two guys were playing KOF '97, and somebody did a wakeup super and won, and went over and stabbed the guy who lost.

Wayne: Oh my— wait, he— he WON and then stabbed that guy who LOST!?

Log: Yup!

Trog: Now, look. That's a mistranslation, they were playing a Shadow Game, and when he lost, he lost his soul.

Gir: He got sent to the Shadow Realm.

Wayne: [crosstalk] He had to drain his blood.

Baaulp: Dude, arcades— maybe arcades are nice in Japan, but arcades in other countries were like— you had to be ready to throw down in game and IRL. It's one of the reasons why I'm not into fighting games. When I was a kid, we lived right next to an arcade. One night, I was in bed, I was asleep. I woke up because I heard a bang. I was like, "Oh, it's China, it must be someone just, I dunno, setting off fireworks for some random reason." I wake up the next day, and my cousin who we lived with—'cause we lived with my uncle—was getting a stern lecture. He didn't do anything wrong, but he was like, "Hey, you can never go to that arcade, and you can never bring me to that arcade ever again, because someone got shot there last night."

Wayne: [crosstalk] Oh my god!

Trog: Jesus. What do you think he did?

Baaulp: I think he still snuck over to the arcade and played, 'cause I think Street Fighter 2 just came out or whatever, so there's multiple Street Fighter 2 arcade machines or something, but he never brought me, and I never got good at fighting games because of it.

Wayne: I think I'm going to be thinking about that wakeup super into stab story forever.

Baaulp: I love that he was like, "Yeah, I won! Clearly I deserve to SURVIVE IRL!"

Wayne: The fucking injury to insult of that.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Just, "Yeah, I win! Now I'm going to kill you."

Gir: [crosstalk] "I win!" *stabbing noises*

Trog: Well, not kill, you can be stabbed in a lot of different places, and they don't all end fatally.

Log: Yeah, good ending to the story, I'm pretty sure the guy that got stabbed survived, and the both of them are friends.

Trog: Alright, well, [crosstalk] sometimes you just gotta—

Gir: What? That's an even stranger twist.

Trog: Hey, hey, hey. I'll be honest, whenever I was big into Tekken 7, if I was in the same room as you guys while I was playing that game, I probably would've stabbed you too. Fuck Tekken.

Wayne: You were talking about stabbing them in nonfatal places, and now I'm imagining he wins, and he's so excited, he doesn't go and stab him in the chest like a violent attack, he just goes like, "Yeah, alright!", and then he just stabs him in his pinky toe. Just something very nonpermanent.

Gir: He pulls his knife out and he's like, "Where is this NOT going to kill you?"

Wayne: [crosstalk] I just wanna hurt you a little bit.

Trog: Well, you didn't read the whole story, he actually— his left hand was just a sword, and he tried to give him a high five. He tried to shake his hand, say good game.

Gir: [crosstalk] GG, dude.

Wayne: Yeah, and he stabbed. [crosstalk] He did a stabbing motion for his high five, for some reason.

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: Yeah, we learned a lot. We learned a lot about Dragon Ball Super, about bugs, about CRIME! We're all criminals, apparently. [crosstalk] All child crimes. 

Wayne: We learned about my criminal history. 

Log: I'm a good boy. 

Wayne: Well, mine was teen crimes, to be fair. [crosstalk] The teen crime of eating three cookies. 

Baaulp: Let's answer some of your questions. 

Gir: Bastard. 

Trog: If you want to have your question read and answered on this podcast, join the WayneRadioTV Discord, which I assume we'll have a link somewhere. 

Wayne: Yeah, scroll down. Look down, [crosstalk] I'm pointing down over there. 

Baaulp: Look around you, it could be in real life! 

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, you never know. 

Log: Yeah, you havin' trouble gettin' your questions read on My Brother, My Brother, and Me? Well, you're in luck, [crosstalk] here's some other place that takes questions, and— 

Wayne: We'll read anything! 

Trog: Yeah. 

Baaulp: We'll answer ANYTHING. 

Log: Yeah, we'll read anything! 

Gir: We're fuckin' dumb! 

Log: Also, you're competing with like, ten other people! 

Trog: Yeah, exactly. You are essentially guaranteed an answer, can't guarantee whether or not that answer will be sufficient for you. But— 

Wayne: Unless your question is bad. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Baaulp: You want some F-Grade McElroy's? 

Trog: Yeah, [crosstalk] we're not just like the B-Team, we're like the J-Team. 

Wayne: Well, this isn't really an advice— 

Log: Yeah, we're not— 

Trog: This is not advice. 

Wayne: This is not an advice show like the McElroy's. 

Baaulp: Yeah, why do you think we're F-Grade? 

Wayne: [crosstalk] We can't help you. 

Baaulp: We failed the inspection. 

Wayne: If you want help, we can't help you. I'm sorry. 

Log: Yeah, you want help from criminals? No. 

Gir: I'll tell you what I did when I was a kid, but don't expect any advice. 

Gir: 40 Winks. 

Trog: [crosstalk] What is that? 

Wayne: The flash game from nick.com? 

Gir: No, PlayStation game. Look it up. 

Wayne: I dunno what that is, [crosstalk] tell me about it. 

Trog: I've never heard of that. 

Baaulp: Yeah, what? 

Gir: I loved it as a kid, I played it again when I was, like, [crosstalk] I played it like 3 or 4— 

Wayne: Well, what is it? 

Trog: Yeah, what kind of game? 

Gir: It's like— I like, expunged it from my memory. [crosstalk] I couldn't even tell you anymore. 

Trog: It's gone. 

Baaulp: Good job. Good job, I guess, for getting it out of your head. I know what my game is for this question. Simpson's Treehouse of Horror for the Nintendo— Game Boy Color. I was poor, my parents had just bought me my Game Boy Color, which was like, my first game console. It was my birthday, and I was like, "Hey, I have one game, like one video game. Just one. Can I have more?" and they're like "Sure, it's your birthday.", they bought me two games. They bought me a port of Mario Bros., like, the original, on Gameboy Color— 

Trog: Oh, I had that, that was good. 

Baaulp: They also bought me Simpsons Treehouse of Horror, and I'm pretty sure I picked that one 'cause I liked the Simpsons. That game was trash. I played the hell out of it as a kid, it is not good. It's like, it's just a really shitty platformer with, like, really— way too tight controls. The jump was like— you couldn't control it, you just jumped a set distance, and that's it. 

Wayne: For my game, it was not one that I've played in recent time. Like, I did not go back and play it and then say "Oh man, this is ass". I just remember loving this when I was a kid, and then thinking back on it, and seeing it. I dunno what the fuck I was thinking, and this is the game Rugrats in Paris. 

Trog: Oh my god. 

Wayne: Which came on a black N64 cartridge, [crosstalk] and I do not know why. 

Trog: Yup. 

Wayne: But— so there were other Rugrats games. There were tons of them. There was one on PS1, it was a platformer. You play as Tommy Pickles, you gotta find your Reptar puzzle, it was great! It was fun. I'm pretty sure in that game, there's a level where you have to jump over electrified water, and if you hit it, you are a baby and you die of electrocution. That's unrelated. Rugrats in Paris was basically just a game where you walked around and then you went to an attraction in a park and you played minigames to get tickets. I don't remember too much about those minigames, but the unbearably bad part of this game, navigating? I apparently didn't remember this at all. It was like, tank controls, and you walked at the speed of a 2 year old on— like, bipedally. [crosstalk] Not crawling. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: It was so fucking bad. [crosstalk] I don't know how I enjoyed that as a child. 

Gir: It's realistic. 

Log: You walk at the speed of a Rugrat. 

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, it's realistic. 

Wayne: I mean, yes, but— yes, but, I dunno. I played it a lot. I don't know why I did. I loved it. 

Gir: [crosstalk] You were dumb. 

Trog: You know, that's funny, that's a really good segue into mine, because I have two in mind that I both— I literally still own them, they're sitting in my living room in a box right now. The first one is Glover. I had Glover for the N64 as a kid, and I think the reason I didn't realize how bad it was as a kid, is that, I was really bad at video games and like, wasn't good enough to finish a lot of them at that age. So I didn't realize, like, it never even crossed my mind that Glover was hard was because it controlled like fucking shit, and I just thought I was bad at video games. But then I went back and played it as an adult, and I'm like "Oh no, this game is still hard, because it controls like fucking shit, and it's terrible!" So there's that one, and the second one is Rugrats Scavenger Hunt, and I don't know how, [crosstalk] I— 

Wayne: What? For what console? 

Gir: Two Rugrats. 

Trog: I don't know how I got that game. I think I asked for it, which was the weird part, [crosstalk] but I don't have— 

Wayne: What console? What console? 

Trog: N64. 

Wayne: What? What is this game? 

Trog: It's called Rugrat Scavenger Hunt, it's a board game, but not like Mario Party where there's like, games to do. It's just a board game. It's just a digital board game where you roll dice and you walk around as the Rugrats. And I don't know why I wanted this as a kid, it doesn't make any sense. And it like, perplexes me any time I remember that I own that game. 

Wayne: Y'know, this is unrelated, but when I was a kid— when I was young, when I was like, really really young, I played N64. And like, I don't think I understood how to get games. Most— I had a couple games that I just HAD, I never got more, and then I just rented all the others. I didn't understand the concept of buying a game for a really long time. I don't know why. And then I got like, Banjo-Tooie for Christmas, and I played that game forever. I probably have like, 300 hours on Banjo-Tooie just as a child. But uh, anybody else have any other bad childhood games? 

Log: Y'know, it's funny, 'cause like, I'm realizing how rare it is for me to actually go back to childhood games ever. 

Wayne: Yeah, me too. 

Log: I don't know if I've had this situation just 'cause of like, how few games I played in my childhood that I actually went back to ever. 

Trog: Really? 

Wayne: Yeah. 

Log: I dunno, games that I have gone— I don't even know if this can count as "gone back to", but like, Soulcalibur 2, I played a lot of that. That feels even better, I played that this weekend. Paper Mario, [crosstalk] still Grade A. 

Trog: Yeah, that games still great. 

Log: A plus. 

Gir: So the answer is no, [crosstalk] there's no old games you dislike. 

Log: SSX 3, [crosstalk] I played that on Dolphin like a year ago or something, still pretty good. 

Baaulp: Oh hell yeah. 

Log: There's a lot of games that I remember playing the shit out of, like Mario and Luigi Superstar Saga, and like, one of the Lord of the Rings games, and like, Rayman, like the original and stuff. But like, I haven't played those games since I was a kid. 

Baaulp: Dude, you just had good taste as a kid. 

Trog: Yeah, I was about to say, is what you're saying just that you had really good taste as a kid, and you didn't have any bad games? 

Log: Well, it's just like, if there was a bad game, [crosstalk] I recognized it? 

Trog: You don't remember it? 

Log: Like I bought, what's it called, Amazing Island? 

Trog: I have no idea, [crosstalk] what is that? 

Log: Do you remember that game? 

Trog: [crosstalk] No. 

Gir: No one knows what that is. 

Log: Let me make sure that that's the name of it. 

Gir: Oops, it was Lego Island. 

Log: Yeah, Amazing Island for the GameCube. I'll link— 

Wayne: I know Amazing Island. 

Log: I'll link the picture of the box art. [crosstalk] Here, check it out. 

Trog: I have no idea what this is. 

Log: Yeah, so I spent 50 dollars on this game when it came out. 

Gir: Yeesh. 

Log: Whenever I was like, probably 10. And just— it took me about a week or so, but at that point I was like, "Yeah, I recognize this as trash. This is unplayable." 

Wayne: Okay, uh, one more video game related question from me, myself. This is just one I'm curious about. Did any of you guys play any video games before you could read? 

Baaulp: No. 

Trog: Hm, [crosstalk] that's a good question. 

Gir: Maybe. 

Wayne: 'Cause I definitely did. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Um... man, I dunno! 

Log: Um... whenever I was like, 4, I got ahold of some other kids Game Boy with a Pokémon game in it, and I managed to overwrite the save somehow. 

Gir: Oh nice. That was like, my biggest fear, was my little sister doing that. 

Wayne: I played— I mean, how old were you guys when you learned to read? That's another question. 

Gir: I don't fuckin' know. 

Log: Honestly, it was either 4 or 5. [crosstalk] I dunno. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: For me it was 5 or 6. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Somewhere around 4 or 5, but I think— 

Baaulp: I learned how to read at 5, 'cause that's also when I came to America. 

Wayne: For me it was like 5 or 6. When I was 4— well, I turned 5 the same year the Game Boy Advance released, but um— Yeah, I turned 5 in 2001. And that was the same year the Game Boy Advance released, but that was also a little bit after the Game Boy Advance released. So at this time I was 4 years old, my brother and my sister had Golden Sun, an RPG. And I pretty much— when I was a kid, if there was a video game, I wanted to play it. I didn't care what it was, I saw cool colors on that box, it was like "Hell yeah, gimme that shit." 

Gir: Oh, that's a wordy game. 

Wayne: Yeah, it's a very wordy game! But I didn't even get to play the game, because I launched it and got to the main menu, couldn't read the words on the main menu, 'cause I didn't know how to read. Navigated the menu within one try. It wasn't trial and error, just the first thing I did, was erase ALL the saves. 

Trog: Oh no. 

Wayne: And my brother and sister were so mad at me. And I did this AGAIN with, um... what was the other game? Ocarina of Time. I wiped the saves on that accidentally. 

Trog: Oh man. 

Wayne: I'm pretty sure I did this with Banjo-Tooie as well. [crosstalk] I wiped the saves on that. 

Baaulp: You're a monster. 

Gir: I would've kicked your ass. 

Wayne: It was accidental EVERY time. But I just managed— every single time navigating the menus, I managed to wipe the saves trying to access the game. 

Baaulp: Gir, real quick, [crosstalk] do you have an answer for that question? 

Gir: I already said. 

Trog: He said 1000 Winks or whatever. 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, that's right, what the fuck is that? 

Gir: 40 Winks. 

Trog: 40 Winks, not 1000. 

Wayne: 1000 Winks! 

Trog: I'll be honest, Wayne, what you asked has me so fucked up right now, 'cause I can't remember ever not knowing how to read, and I know that's not true, I know I wasn't born and immediately knew how to read, [crosstalk] but I can't— 

Gir: 'Cause it was like, over 20 years ago. 

Trog: I know, [crosstalk] but like, it's crazy! 

Wayne: I can remember this— I think these memories of deleting these save files are what ties the memory [crosstalk] of not knowing how to read and what that was like to my memory. 

Trog: Yeah, that's probably— I probably just don't have any strong memories of that. 

Log: [crosstalk] Hey, hey— 

Baaulp: Can we get uh, can we move onto the next question? 

Log: Well, hold on. 

Wayne: Hold on. 

Trog: Wait. 

Baaulp: Okay. 

Wayne: We’re having a good conversation. 

Log: How old are you whenever you go to preschool? If you go to preschool. 

Gir: Like 5. 

Trog: Probably 4. 

Wayne: 5. 

Trog: No, [crosstalk] I think you're 4. 

Gir: Between 4 and 5. 

Trog: You're between 4 and 5. 

Wayne: No, yeah, it's 4. 'Cause you go to kindergarten at 6, right? 

Trog: No, [crosstalk] you go to kindergarten at— well, you can, it depends on when you're born. 

Log: No, 5. You go to kindergarten at 5. 

Trog: It's either 5 or 6. 

Log: Like, I dunno, [crosstalk] I know I knew— 

Wayne: I went when I was 10. 

Log: I know I knew how to read in preschool, because I distinctly remember they had mats with peoples names on them, and I remember just looking at one that said "Ray" on it. 

Trog: Well there you go. 

Wayne: I think around that time, I was learning to read at a basic level, but like, I didn't— it wasn't good enough that I could read like, "New Game" "Erase All Save Files", like, those aren't words that I was trained to read as a 4 year old. 

Log: But also— 

Baaulp: That's what you think. 

Log: I have like, some— 

Wayne: That IS what I think, because I couldn't read them, what the f— what? 

Log: I think the earliest memory I have, and I don't know why— I feel like I got hit by a Men in Black memory fazer whenever I was 2 years old, because I remember there was a point— I was 2 years old, I was just standing there, and suddenly I realized, "Hey, I can talk!", and I just explained that to my mom. "I can talk!", and she's like, "Yeah!", and I just moved on with my life. 

Trog: That's really good. 

Log: And that's the earliest point that I remember, so maybe just up until then, [crosstalk] I just like, forgot myself. 

Wayne: I like the idea that those were actually your first words. 

Trog: Well, Log, you realize whenever you are a very young child, your brain literally isn't developed enough to form memories, that's probably why you don't remember. 

Log: Well, I just think it's— I think it's funny to imagine it like that, though. 

Gir: I had an epiphany like that when I was young, too. I must've been 3 or 4, and in the middle of the night I suddenly woke up and was like, "I can remember some stuff I did.", I had the realization that I can remember the past. 

Trog: Man, my memory sucks compared to you guys. 

Baaulp: I distinctly remember my first memory. I was asleep, I woke up like a drunk person would, where I was like, "Wh-wh-what's going on, what's happening?", and my moms like, "Are you okay? You were asleep.", and I was like, "Oh yeah, okay, cool.", and I went back to sleep. 

Trog: That's the most Baaulp thing I've ever heard. 

Wayne: I have like, 10 memories of falling off my parents bed, the same exact way. 

Baaulp: Holy shit! 

Trog: Okay, I'm gonna read the— 

Wayne: I used to roll off the bed so many times, we should do a new question now, [crosstalk] because we've been talking about this forever. 

Trog: Yeah, we— we gotta, we gotta, we gotta— 

Gir: Stay on topic here. 

Gir: I like garlic bread, but I don't like wet bread. 

Wayne: My lea— 

Trog: Hold on, wait wait wait, before anybody else goes, I just wanna ask, is everybody's going to be garlic bread? [crosstalk] Because mine— 

Wayne: No. It's not my favorite. 

Baaulp: No. 

Trog: Okay, I'm just curious 'cause mine is definitely garlic bread. 

Baaulp: Yeah, garlic bread's good. 

Gir: If not garlic bread, then banana bread. 

Wayne: Alright, I have both of mine prepped. One of the answers probably won't make sense to anyone, 'cause I don't really know how else to describe it, but uh... least favorite. 12 grain bread. I think it's 12 grain, I think that's what they call it. [crosstalk] Maybe it's like 15 grain, or something like that. 

Gir: Is that the one with seeds all through it? 

Wayne: It's the ones with seeds in it, but— it's the one with seeds in it that feel like you're biting into flesh. 

Trog: What the hell? 

Wayne: It's a very fleshy nut, or seed, or something in it. [crosstalk] It's just gross. 

Trog: I've never had that before. 

Log: Well, does it taste like anything, [crosstalk] or is it just the texture? 

Gir: It tastes like wheat bread. 

Wayne: It's the texture. Well, it tastes like a very strong whole grain bread, but I'll eat whole grain. I'll eat that, whole wheat, or whatever it is. It tastes like a very strong whole wheat bread with the seeds in it. But its that texture of just biting into this chunky, meaty seed, [crosstalk] I hate it. 

Gir: It's kind of leathery. 

Wayne: Yeah, it's gross. [crosstalk] And my favorite— 

Gir: Not super great. 

Wayne: Actually, I'll— someone else go, I'll get back to my favorite, I gotta think about this. 

Baaulp: 'Cause you can't name cornbread or uh, [crosstalk] garlic bread? 

Wayne: No, it's not cornbread. 

Log: Y'know, the shitty one out there, that rye stuff. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: I love rye! 

Trog: [crosstalk] I don't like rye either. 

Wayne: Have you ever had rye pumpernickel swirl? 

Log: That's not a— that's not a bread taste, I'm pretty sure. Pumpernickel's the other one that doesn't taste like bread, right? 

Trog: I mean, they're bread, [crosstalk] so you're technically wrong, but... 

Wayne: It tastes like bread. 

Log: [crosstalk] What does pumpernickel look like? I gotta, I gotta— 

Wayne: Bread is not a flavor. Bread is a texture. 

Trog: Bread is not a flavor, you're right. 

Wayne: It's true! 

Baaulp: You guys suck at this. I'm gonna go next. [crosstalk] I like... cornbread— 

Log: Oh wait, pumpernickel's fine. 

Wayne: Log was not done, but okay. 

Trog: Log wasn't done. 

Log: Yeah, wait— [crosstalk] OR is pumpernickel the bad one? 

Trog: Cut this out. 

Wayne: Baaulp, YOU suck, because you suck at podcasting! 

Baaulp: What? 

Log: Okay, yeah, yeah— okay, yeah— 

Gir: Every fucking time! 

Log: I think if you gave me a pumpernickel rye swirl bread, I would die on impact. 

Wayne: No, it's so good! 

Log: Those are the two worst flavors of bread in existence by far. 

Wayne: It's got like a sour-ish kind of taste, with a very savory flavor. It's so good, it's so good with like, a turkey cheese mayo, just somethin' simple on that... Mmm! 

Log: It tastes like you've got a weird perfume, like a weird— like you've somehow got a smell on your bread, [crosstalk] and you're tasting the smell. 

Gir: Potpourri bread. 

Wayne: You gotta have the Jewish bake! 

Log: What— okay! 

Gir: What! 

Log: [crosstalk] Don't know what that means! 

Wayne: That's what its called! I'm pretty sure that's what its called. Y'know, is Pepperidge Farms the company with the bread and the goldfish? 

Gir: Oh yeah, I remember them. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: Pepperidge Farms makes— I think its called like, Jewish Bake Rye Pumpernickel Swirl, or maybe it's like, Hebrew, I dunno— 

Log: I just found an image on Google Images of Pepperidge Farms Jewish Pumpernickel Dark Pump. 

Gir: Dark Pump! 

Wayne: No, that's not what I'm talking about! It's Rye Pumpernickel Swirl! 

Trog: No, [crosstalk] it's Dark Pump! 

Wayne: It is definitely Jewish, though. 

Log: I think that those two are very disappointing.  

Log: However, I will give you an insight into a good bread item. Recently, I've been getting into new bread. 

Gir: Experimental breads. 

Log: Yeah. Have you guys ever had bread pudding? 

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, I hate it. 

Trog: Uh, I have. 

Wayne: I don't think so! [crosstalk] I don't think I've ever had it. 

Gir: I change my mind, that's my least favorite bread item, [crosstalk] is fucking bread pudding. 

Wayne: Really? Never had it. 

Log: So... I think there's like, a lot of different kinds, 'cause I mean, it just depends on what bread you have. But recently, I've had bread pudding, and like... I've never had bread pudding before this past month. But I've had it a couple times this past month, since... pretty much since I've started my job, and it's like, "Mmm. That's some good stuff." 

Gir: Nope, can't stand that shit. 

Log: There was a day where I had access to a dessert bar with unlimited desserts that had bread pudding at it. That was some nice times. I almost got it today, but I resisted because it costed 3 dollars. 

Gir: How 'bout you, Baaulp? 

Trog: It's the best bread you've ever had, but I refuse to spend any more than 2 dollars on it. 

Log: Well, it's just that the meal that I already had costed like, 10. 

Trog: Yeah, no, I get you. [crosstalk] I was just making fun of you. 

Gir: I wouldn't spend more than 3 dollars. 

Baaulp: My favorite bread, cornbread. I can inhale that stuff. 

Wayne: Cornbread is pretty good. 

Baaulp: Cornbread is sooo fucking good. 

Wayne: I like a cornbread. 

Log: Do you like it with the corn in it, or the corn, like, [crosstalk] hidden? 

Gir: Out of it. 

Baaulp: Uh, I hope the corn is not just still in chunks. 

Wayne: Is chunky cornbread a thing? 

Log: Yeah, [crosstalk] there's chunky cornbread. 

Baaulp: Yeah. 

Wayne: Ew! EW! [crosstalk] Who would eat that shit? That's vile! 

Log: You can have cornbread with like, visible corn in it. 

Baaulp: That’s gross. 

Wayne: That's fucking vile! 

Trog: I guess you're not as big of a cornbread fan as you thought. 

Gir: Cornbread's supposed to be made of corn MEAL, not actual corn. 

Baaulp: Yeah, not— [crosstalk] it's corn MEAL, not corn. Corn. 

Log: Y'all city slickers never been down to the south, we got— 

Gir: I HAVE, and they don't eat it there. 

Log: We got a different whole view of corn 'round here. [crosstalk] We put it right in the bread. 

Trog: We put wasps in our cornbread. 

Gir: We put wasps— we pull it out of our corn holes! 

Wayne: Log, is your cornbread chunky? 

Log: I don't eat cornbread very much. 

Wayne: Okay. 

Log: Usually it's not, but sometimes it is. 

Baaulp: Well, try smooth cornbread. Maybe you'll like it more. 

Wayne: It's so good, if your cornbread is smooth. Mmm! It's like a cornish butter. 

Baaulp: The next time you guys come to Boston, we're gonna have to try to go to a place called Fat Cat. No matter what you get, they bring out cornbread. [crosstalk] And like— 

Gir: This is an advertisement. 

Baaulp: Honey butter, and hummus, it's so good. 

Trog: Yeah, no free plugs, Baaulp. Come on. 

Log: [crosstalk] Cornbread and hummus? 

Wayne: No locations, no locations. 

Trog: They gotta pay us if they want advertising. 

Gir: Woah, wait, yeah. That's a weird ass combo. Cornbread and hummus? 

Baaulp: It's so good. It's all so good, I've put it all in my mouth. 

Trog: Yeah, that doesn't sound that bad. 

Wayne: I could eat that. That— oh, that just sparked a fucking culinary brain blast. That sounds delicious. 

Baaulp: Anyway— 

Wayne: Okay, I wanna hear your least favorite, 'cause I think it could be the biggest upset. 

Log: Oh no, hold on!  

Wayne: What? 

Log: This is a Mira question, and I got like a fuckin'... amnesia revival, 'cause you said brain blast. 'Cause I just remembered something Mira talked about where he had his dream where he was watching two people argue, and it got like— it did like a brain blast camera pan into the guys brain, and instead of him saying "brain blast" at the end, he just burped really aggressively. 

Wayne: Okay, Baaulp, least favorite bread item. 

Baaulp: My least favorite bread? I gotta go with Log. I don't like rye, I don't like pumpernickel. 

Trog: Ooh, yeah. [crosstalk] Fuck 'em! 

Wayne: Pumper— ugh. Fuck you! I must be the only one that likes it, [crosstalk] I love it. 

Trog: You are! 

Baaulp: You got a weird tongue. 

Gir: I have no strong opinion. 

Wayne: It's an aged flavor. It requires a very— particular taste. 

Baaulp: I don't want my bread old or sour. 

Wayne: It's not old! [crosstalk] And it's not sour! 

Trog: It's not sour. That's sourdough. 

Wayne: You don't like sourdough? 

Baaulp: No. 

Trog: I like sourdough. 

Gir: I like sourdough. 

Trog: Sourdough's good. 

Wayne: It has a— it's like a minor sour flavor, but it's not literally sour. 

Gir: Hey, you ever dip au jus— uh— dub— dip sou— fuckin' Jesus. Hold on, I'm havin' a brain meltdown. 

Baaulp: *buuuurp* 

Gir: You ever dip sourdough bread into au jus sauce? 

Wayne: Au jus sauce? 

Log: Probably. 

Trog: No, but that sounds really good. 

Baaulp: I've dipped other breads into au jus sauce. 

Gir: It's super fucking good. 

Wayne: I don't know what that is. 

Trog: You've never had a french dip? 

Gir: It's watery gravy. 

Wayne: Oh, I've had french dip. 

Gir: I'll give you a french dip. 

Trog: [crosstalk] That's the kind of sauce in a french dip. 

Wayne: I didn't know that's what that was called. 

Trog: Wayne, did you say your favorite bread— [crosstalk] is it cornbread? 

Wayne: I haven't said my favorite yet, but I'm gonna go over some runners-up, because I'm having a real hard time picking it. It's not cornbread. You know what's really good? Bread bowls. Bread bowls for soup. [crosstalk] That shit's delicious. 

Baaulp: But that's not like, a type of bread. 

Trog: Yeah. No, that counts. That counts as a bread item. 

Wayne: But that is a flavor, [crosstalk] because it's a type of sourdough. 

Gir: That's a shape of bread. 

Trog: The question was not the— 

Wayne: It's a type of sourdough. It's a specific type of bread that makes bread bowls. 

Baaulp: Oh my god. 

Trog: [crosstalk] The question was not— 

Gir: What shape of bread do you like? 

Trog: Look. The question was "favorite bread item". It didn't say, like, type of bread. [crosstalk] So it could be a pretzel. 

Gir: That's fair. 

Wayne: Yeah, I like bread armor. Bread castle. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Baaulp: Eh. 

Gir: Move on. 

Wayne: Did that concept just like, flatline you guys? 

Trog: [crosstalk] Eh. No, I'm good. 

Gir: Yes. 

Wayne: I picked a bread item, what-the-fuck do you want? 

Gir: [crosstalk] What-the-fuck? 

Trog: No, it's good. 

Wayne: Okay, so other bread item runners-up. Naan. Naan is so good. [crosstalk] I love naan. 

Trog: Oh yeah, naan's good too. 

Wayne: Naan is delicious.  

Gir: It's a naan-bread. 

Wayne: But I think number 1— It's just this— like, Italian bread, but its specifically from this one restaurant, they give you these rolls, Bertucci's, it's a chain, I was talking about these the other week, they're so good. They're hot, they're fresh. [crosstalk] They're good. This is my ???. 

Baaulp: Hold up, hold up. The rolls they give you for free at Bertucci's is your number 1? 

Wayne: Yes! Those are so good. 

Baaulp: Come on, man. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Mine is just garlic bread, and garlic bread is— 

Wayne: Have you been to Bertucci's? 

Baaulp: Yes! 

Wayne: Those shits are so good. 

Baaulp: That's not even the garlic bread, oh my fucking god. 

Wayne: It's not garlic bread! It's fluffy, fresh baked, Italiano bread, my friend. 

Log: Have you ever been to the House of Flying Rolls? 

Wayne: No! Next question. 

Gir: Is that a church? 

Trog: Wait, hang on, this just reminded me, and then we'll move on. But since you got to do two, I wanna say that my runner-up is those Pillsbury pull-apart biscuits where you bake them, and they turn into like, magical layers, [crosstalk] and you peel 'em apart. 

Wayne: Oh, like dinner rolls? 

Trog: [crosstalk] I don't know exactly what they are. 

Gir: Put honey on those, and they're even better. 

Trog: Yeah, those are hella good. Alright, next question. 

Log: I caught a roll at the House of Flying Rolls and I cried 'cause it was hot. 

Gir: Oh, this is not for me! 

Log: Alright, here's the Log Advice. You've never seen me in action, so like, you might be thinking "Who the fuck is this guy? He just plays as Porky Bashwagon!", here's the real trick that everybody loves. Whenever you DM, if you have NPCs that your characters are gonna meet, don't even think of a name for them until they've walked up and talked to the NPC. You'll produce some top quality shit, my friend. 

Wayne: Do you have examples? I can't remember. 

Gir: Me neither. [crosstalk] That's the drawback. 

Log: Whenever I was in charge— so, like, the drawback is that they don't remember and neither do I. So there's some characters I'm pretty sure I changed the name of every time they talked to them. 

Trog: [crosstalk] I remember a couple. 

Log: There's a couple. 

Wayne: Nermal. 

Log: Yeah, there's Nerm— well, Nermal's just Nermal from Garfield, so that doesn't count. 

Wayne: You planned that one. You downloaded a picture of Nermal and put it in roll20. 

Log: Yeah. 

Trog: Yeah, that one was right there. 

Log: But there was a time where these boys, and all of these boys were playin' in my campaign, they walked up to a guy and that guy was just a guy that I immediately thought up of, and I got into my character voice and I said, "Yeah man, what's up? Name's Faucet." 

Trog: Oh yeah, Faucet! 

Gir: Oh yeah, Faucet. 

Wayne: Faucet was good. 

Trog: Faucet was good. I think the most— 

Log: And then I'm pretty sure I named an ogre Ice Cream, [crosstalk] that was an ogre who selled Ice Cream. 

Gir: Yes, you did. 

Trog: Yeah. I'm pretty sure. 

Wayne: Yes, yes, his name was Ice Cream. 

Trog: I remember Grill Skillman. 

Log: Oh yeah! Gilly Skill— No, it was Gilly Skillman. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Gilly Skillman, 

Wayne: A good name from an ancient campaign, Baaulp's campaign, the first one we ever played together, was Slappo the Dwarf, a jail guard who just slapped your hands if you stuck them out of the cell. 

Trog: Yeah. That's a good character, but they're looking for tips. Do we have any more tips for DMing or playing D&D? 

Baaulp: On character creation, I think— for the longest time I thought "Eh, whatever", but everyone seems to like the dumb characters. I don't know how much of it is me playing them, and how much it is because the characters are good, but I basically just have two roles whenever I make player characters or important characters. A: They have to follow, like, a simple set of rules, and when you're playing the character, you have to abide by them. They— I try to make them goofy, like Midet is a bounty hunter, so he has to just cut off peoples heads and like, that's it. Every time you kill someone important like, "Hey, how do we prove we actually got this guy? I know, I'll chop their head off." Very good being like— I guess he ended up not being a pacifist, but he was very timid. 

Trog: Yeah, no. 

Baaulp: You just have to pick something [crosstalk] and stick with it, if you can. 

Log: Keep in mind, you just listed two characters that nobody has heard of. 

Trog: Keep in mind people listening have no idea who these people are. But I understand the advice. 

Log: But like, to explain— well, this isn't really a DMing part, but what Baaulp creates consistently some of the best characters ever, and it's because he just draws from himself for a lot. He doesn't, like— he's playing a character, but he's still not making himself into something he's not. So it's very authentic and good feeling. 

Baaulp: Yeah, if you can take a little piece of yourself, not like— don't make your character YOU, but pick a quality that you already are, I guess, and try to spin that into something.  

Baaulp: It'll be good for beginners, too, if you're not accustomed to putting yourself in a really crazy roll where you're pretending to be someone that you entirely aren't. 

Wayne: Yeah, I won't name names, but there are certain Dungeons and Dragons characters that are something you entirely aren't, and they did not turn out very good. Definitely draw from yourself a little bit. Are you a loud person? Play a loud character. Are you a psychic that wants to battle for mind wits? You play that. 

Gir: Are you actually a psychic? 

Wayne: My DM tip: make sure that you don't make your characters do something just for the sake of doing it that wouldn't already be part of their personal motivations. Like, if they're questing— if they're doing a quest, and really their only characters personal motivation is "We're doing this, we're gonna get money at the end", but that's not the characters goal, it makes for a very boring time. That's something that I learned from doing my campaign, where I sent the players off following an old man, doing a mission— a secretive mission that he couldn't tell them anything about, because that was part of the plot. I found very quickly, none of the characters really had any investment, because they were just kind of doing it because I told them to. Player agency is really important, and that's something I came to learn by doing that campaign. 

Log: Yeah, that's a big thing. That's probably like, a lot of things people get all confused about in these modern times. Don't try to be The Adventure Zone, don't try to be Critical Role or whatever. 

Trog: Yeah, don't, definitely. 

Log: Don't try and make a fuckin' story, alright? You have— basically, you just come up with a couple ideas, and don't expect— you have to just make up stuff. I talked about coming up with a guy named Faucet as a joke, but it's just like— you have to do stuff like that, because if you have humans as your players, they will not follow a path. And if they have to follow a path, it's kinda lame, right? 

Wayne: My original idea with that campaign was like, "Yeah, there's a bigger story, and that's how I'm gonna piece together in these individual, like, set-pieces, where they can play around freely and do whatever they want in those set-pieces, accomplishing the one greater goal". But, I feel like what you were saying about, is like, yeah, come up with these concepts. Come up with your grand overarching concepts, but let them come to that when they come to that on their own. If you've got this really cool idea for a big story thing, you don't wanna force them into it. Don't just walk them to it, let them stumble upon it, I guess. 

Gir: Yeah, I think it's really important to remember that you don't be Mr. No Fun, and force people along the way you want them to go. You gotta let them fuck around every now and then. 

Log: And that's still hard, but— 

Wayne: And even that, that still happens. My campaign, I don't think it was bad, I just think like, in terms of character development and worldbuilding, it was boring just because there was no— they were basically following a line in terms of "Yeah, you need to go this way and do this thing", they couldn't go to the places they wanted to go. Once they were in a place, it was like, whatever. I wasn't like, "Okay, go to this house, then this house, then this house!", do whatever, I dunno. Let the players run free, let them find the things you've put for them. Don't ensure that they get them. 

Gir: You've made up a world, let them explore it. 

Trog: I think the best way I've heard of describing to make sure that stuff like that doesn't happen is, you have to think about if you're the DM, you're creating a world, and the world should happen— events in the world should happen whether or not your players are there to witness them. So if you have something planned, it shouldn't be, like, "Oh, the players will go here, and that will trigger this to happen." It should be more like, "Something will happen at this place, and if the players are around to see it, then they get to experience it. If they're not, then maybe the events will go down in a different way, but the event still happens." Y'know? 

Wayne: Remember that your world— it's not like a video game, it's not a video game. I think that's actually in general, not just for this single concept, a good tip. But remember that it's not a video game, it doesn't have to work like a video game. It's not like these things that are happening in your world are not gonna render if your players aren't next to it. 

Trog: Yeah. Well, see, it's funny that you mention that, because my next piece of advice was actually just going to be, "Go and play Divinity 2. Go buy it on Steam." Go play Divinity 2, because it's really good, and I dunno. Playing that game— if you don't know what Divinity 2 is, it's a, uh— 

Wayne: CRPG. 

Trog: CRPG. Really good, you don't have to play the first one to play the second one. I never played the first one and i absolutely loe the second one. But playing that game just got me like... SUPER back into wanting to DM again. And I dunno if it's just the fact that it's an RPG or just the fact that it's like, I dunno. Something about that game. [crosstalk] Maybe, y'know— 

Wayne: It's a really cool fantasy world.  

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: It's a really cool story with really cool grander concepts, and also I think one thing I love about it is the individual aspect of every sidequest.  

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: Every little side quest is like— some sidequests might just be like, "Hey, there are these two cows. They're people. They were turned into cows. Go get them a potion. Pick which one you want to become a human again." and then that's over.  

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: But then another sidequest is this big, giant, crazy thing. That's another thing in D&D. Make little, silly, weird things happen. Or cool things happen. 

Gir: Be creative. 

Wayne: It's a fantasy world. You could run into a talking frog that wants you to bring it a huge loaf of bread. Some shit like that, I dunno. 

Gir: Or doesn't even have to be a fantasy world. It could be a fuckin' sci-fi world. 

Wayne: Well, yeah. Whatever— 

Trog: Yeah, exactly. 

Gir: [crosstalk] It could be cowboy world. 

Wayne: It's still fantasy no matter what. Like, you're playing D&D, you don't get away from the fantasy. 

Gir: My point is you don't have to do high fantasy if you don't want to. 

Trog: Nah. 

Wayne: Don't play your game in the real world! Don't do that! 

Baaulp: Don't LARP. LARPing is bad. 

Gir: [crosstalk] Hey, don't— give it a shot! 

Wayne: That's not what I mean. 

Gir: Maybe you have a good idea. 

Trog: To generalize that advice, I guess what I'm saying is don't be afraid to take inspiration from other forms of media, as long as you aren't like, [crosstalk] completely ripping them off. 

Gir: Straight copying it. 

Wayne: Oh no, you can do that too. 

Trog: Well... 

Gir: What? 

Wayne: One of my highest points from my campaign is just making the final boss Geese Howard [crosstalk] but changing his name to Swan Howard. 

Trog: Yeah, that's different. That's fine. 

Gir: He means like, plot line and everything. 

Trog: Yeah, and I mean maybe— 

Wayne: Don't rip it off one-to-one. 

Trog: I shouldn't say that, because I dunno, maybe your players would enjoy just playing the plot of something. But, I will say, definitely don't be afraid to take inspiration from other forms of media. 

Wayne: And your Samurai Jack campaign, that we’re playing right now. 

Gir: This may shock you, but we took inspiration from Dragon Ball a lot. 

Trog: Which is really funny, because I actually haven't watched the new Samurai Jack or anything, I just had that show— 

Baaulp: It was bad. 

Trog: I haven't watched that show in forever, I just had it on my mind, and I was like, "I should make a D&D campaign where they're in the future, and they have to go back to the past." And so I did. And you can watch it, every Tuesday, on wayneradiotv.twitch.com. 

Log: Yeah! Yeah! [crosstalk] Yeah! Yeah! 

Baaulp: .twitch.com. 

Trog: That's not— that's— yeah. [crosstalk] Go there. 

Gir: That's not the URL. 

Wayne: wayneradiotv.twitch.com. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah. 

Log: Yeah. 

Wayne: Buy it. Go there. Buy the domain for us. 

Log: Also, my last thing that I'm gonna say for this. If your players don't know about UA classes, if you wanna make things easy for yourself, just don't tell them. 

Trog: Yeah, don't tell them. 

Log: Don't let them know about Artificer or Mystic. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Log: [crosstalk] Like I said before, you gotta let your— 

Wayne: No, it's good! 

Log: You gotta expect your players to just do whatever. So, like, you gotta expect a wrench to be thrown into any grand plans you have. But if you let somebody play as Mystic or Artificer Gunsmith, they will drive a truck into your well-tuned machine, and you will have to pick up the pieces. 

Trog: Basically, the best thing you can do, is read what your players can actually do before you start planning things out. 

Wayne: Yeah. 

Trog: Because you could plan something out, and have it completely fold because you didn't realize that one of your magic users in their party has like, some random spell that completely ruins whatever puzzle or anything you have planned. 

Wayne: My favorite example of that was in the Pathfinder campaign we played, Baaulp's campaign, the very first one we played. Where Baaulp had a maze, that was— wait, no no no, [crosstalk] this was Trog's campaign. 

Gir: This was our current one. 

Wayne: No no no, no, this was Trog's Pathfinder campaign.  

Gir: Oh. 

Trog: Mhmm. 

Wayne: Where I played as a teleporting gnome— 

Gir: Oh, yeah. 

Wayne: The funny thing was, this was a little bit into the campaign, this wasn't the very first thing we did. So the DM knew that I was a teleporting gnome, and still put a maze full of mines, that I just teleported past the entire thing. [crosstalk] It's that kind of thing. 

Trog: I remember that. 

Log: Yeah, I tried to have a fight with a superpowered satyr on a rooftop, but Wayne picked Mystic, so he just, "Oh yeah, I jump 50 feet to the next rooftop and leave!". 

Trog: Yeah. 

Gir: Here's the thing, like— 

Wayne: Hey, I thought that was a cool solution to that fight. 

Gir: If your major obstacle is a hole, don't— make sure your people can't all just fly over the hole. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: I mean, you can still have that stuff too, [crosstalk] but make sure there's more to it than that. 

Gir: My point is— 

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: Yeah. 

Gir: Double check that your obstacle and their spells aren't, like, [crosstalk] obvious. 

Trog: Lemme let you guys in on a little secret, too. Anti-magic zones, counter-spell, [crosstalk] and de-spell. Use those a lot. 

Gir: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. All that, too. 

Wayne: But at the same time, don't go crazy with it, [crosstalk] because it's just kinda bullshit if it's just like, "Nope, nope. No magic here."  

Trog: No, yeah. Yeah.  

Wayne: Or at least give them a way to fix it, [crosstalk] like, turn it off. 

Trog: Use it in places that is appropriate, I'd say. 

Wayne: Alright, let's move on, next question. 

Trog: Alright. Next question is... okay, well... I see now, looking at this document further down, that Baaulp did not actually put the REAL names of the people, and instead but the names that they are in Discord, which everybody changes those constantly, [crosstalk] so I don't know who this actually is 

Baaulp: Aw crap. Sorry. 

Trog: BEEF— 

Baaulp: I just copy and pasted. 

Trog: Yeah, I noticed. 

Wayne: Beef? 

Log: Gotta be rapier or cutlass. Easy. 

Trog: Oh, so you're goin' like, g— [crosstalk] I thought he was asking, like, specifically, what is your— 

Wayne: Sword style? 

Trog: Like, if you— like... A sword. 

Log: Well, like... how many different named swords are there? 

Wayne: Coolest sword: Cera Symmetry from Monster Hunter. 

Trog: That's a pretty good— that's a damn good choice. 

Gir: Fierce Deity Link's sword. 

Trog: That's a cool one. 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Uh, do other— 

Wayne: Fierce Deedee. 

Gir: Deedee. 

Baaulp: Do other types of things count? 'Cause I'm gonna pick— I'm gonna be that guy, I'm gonna pick swordbreaker. 'Cause I like the idea of someone whipping out a dagger, and— Imagine you don't know what it is. 

Wayne: It's not a sword, sword's in the name, [crosstalk] it doesn't make it a sword. 

Baaulp: Swordbreaker. 

Trog: I don't know what a swordbreaker is. 

Baaulp: A knife is a small sword. 

Wayne: I guess so. 

Trog: I guess so. 

Baaulp: So there you go. I'm that guy, I'll break your sword, [crosstalk] and then I'll stab you with a regular sword. 

Gir: Good question. Next question. 

Trog: No wait, I didn't do mine. Wait, did everybody do theirs? I think— y'know, I was thinking about it, and I had one in mind until Wayne brought up Monster Hunter, and then I was like, I think it's probably gotta be just like— I dunno, it's been so long since I've played a Monster Hunter game at this point. 

Trog: I say that, but it's literally been like, 3 months. That's too long for me. 

Wayne: Oh, you know what's also great? The Nargacuga longswords. Those are awesome. 

Trog: But, I think the concept of both the Switch Axe and the Charge Blade are both really cool. I'm really into weapons that can turn into different weapons, so I think— I don't know if those really count as a sword. I guess at least the Switch Axe does, part of the time, but it's probably gotta be that. 

Log: If I have to give a named weapon, um— You guys know Ike, he's in Smash Brothers.  

Wayne: Mhmm. 

Log: In the Fire Emblem games and stuff, and the sword he has in Smash Brothers, his sword is named Ragnell, and it lets him counter-attack people from any distance. At least, I'm pretty sure— well, at least he can counter attack people from 2 spaces away. And that's great, because all the wizards come at you with their AI and they start fighting Ike, and then he just slams them from 20 miles away. It's good. [crosstalk] Aether's in that game, and it makes him heal for as much damage as he does. 

Wayne: Good sword. 

Trog: Good sword. 

Wayne: Did everybody give their answer? We need more short ones. 

Trog: Yeah, I think. 

Gir: More short ones. 

Wayne: I think everyone did it. Alright. [crosstalk] Next question. 

Trog: Alright, this is a short one— 

Wayne: I have one I'd like to read too. I'll do it at the end. 

Log: Diamond. 

Baaulp: Yeah, if you say anything but diamond, [crosstalk] you're wrong. 

Trog: I think it's unanimously diamond. 

Wayne: No, [crosstalk] my favorite— 

Log: Yeah. I don't fuckin' play Minecraft, it's diamond. 

Wayne: My favorite Minecraft block is... bedrock. 'Cause you can't break it. 

Wayne: Dude, I want live action Kingdom Hearts II. [crosstalk] That'd be the craziest shit. 

Trog: Oh my god. 

Wayne: Question answered. [crosstalk] Next. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Log: No video— What video game works as a movie? What video game movies have been good? [crosstalk] Have there been? 

Trog: None. 

Gir: Heavy Rain. 

Baaulp: Because they always pick action games, but those are structured in a way that you can't really wrap them or fit them in a specific 2 hour narrative without completely butchering them and having to do all sorts of weird things. And video game movies have such a tinge to them, like, if anyone says, "Oh, this is inspired by a video game", that's pretty much a code word for "guaranteed to be bad". 

Wayne: Well, the thing is, you just have to lay into that aspect of it. Like, the fucking Resident Evil movie with that Wesker fight at the end? [crosstalk] 

Trog: Oh my god. 

Wayne: That's the most amazing fucking thing ever. 

Trog: Something that just doesn't ever happen at all in the games. 

Wayne: Yeah. 

Gir: I have one in mind where I know it would be bad, but I'd still like to see them hurt themselves try to make it. I'd like to see somebody fumble over making a Fallout movie. 

Wayne: Oh, it would suck. 

Baaulp: Yeah, [crosstalk] that'd be so bad. 

Gir: That would be like, the funniest disaster. 

Wayne: It would be so bad. 

Trog: Honestly, I thought you were gonna say Half-Life. 

Gir: No. 

Wayne: Half-Life could make a good movie. 

Baaulp: 'Cause, Fallout is a— 

Gir: You give J.J. a few more years. 

Baaulp: Even the first person shooter ones, Fallout is like an RPG. Can you imagine seeing a Fallout movie where some action dude, like Baptista, is doing flips and shooting a laser pistol? 

Wayne: I think a Half-Life movie adaption, I think that might be inevitable. I think that'll happen. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Maybe. 

Gir: J.J. Abrams. already said he plans to do it. 

Trog: That's crazy. 

Gir: That and a Portal movie. 

Wayne: That could be really— [crosstalk] I think both of those could make really good movies. 

Trog: Alright, a Portal movie sounds fucking stupid. There's literally one character— there's two characters in all of Portal. 

Wayne: Wait, yeah. I just realized what Portal is. 

Baaulp: Portal is puzzles. It's puzzles. 

Trog: Yeah, you cannot turn— [crosstalk] let's make a movie out of fuckin' Poyo Poyo. 

Wayne: It would be a completely different thing, and I take back the fact that I accidentally said that it would be good. A Half-Life movie could be fucking awesome, I think a Portal movie would be nothing like the game. 

Gir: What about a Left 4 Dead movie? 

Wayne: That would be generic. 

Trog: Eh, I don't like zombies. 

Wayne: I think one of the reasons Left 4 Dead works is because it is kind of generic. It kinda plays off just like a basic horror movie. 

Gir: That's true. 

Wayne: That's even how the levels start and end, it's a movie poster. 

Baaulp: I know there was a Ratchet and Clank movie, but there was also supposed to— I don't know if it ever got released, there was supposed to be a Sly Cooper movie. 

Trog: Really? 

Wayne: [crosstalk] I don't think that's happened yet. 

Gir: Yeah, there was. 

Baaulp: Yeah, there was a trailer for it as some point. 

Wayne: I think that's still in the works. 

Gir: Yeah, I think that's still in the works. 

Wayne: Or maybe the Ratchet and Clank movie bombed and they cancelled it. 

Baaulp: Well, the Ratchet and Clank movie got like— 

Gir: It did decently. 

Baaulp: Yeah, I don't know how well that did. 

Trog: Did that have theatrical release? 

Gir: [crosstalk] Yes. 

Wayne: Yeah. It was big. 

Trog: Wow, I had no idea. 

Wayne: It came out with the game that was really, really good. 

Trog: Yeah, the remake or whatever. 

Log: Now that I think about it, I feel like you can't really make a good movie with a popular game, really. Half-Life might get close, but name any popular game, it'll probably be a bad movie, ultimately. Nobody's got a track record with popular games being made into good movies. 

Wayne: The newest God of War could probably make a cool movie, [crosstalk] considering they tried to make it like a movie in some facets. 

Log: Maybe, but like, what's the point? 

Gir: Uncharted. Uncharted would make a decent movie. 

Wayne: I would hate it. 

Log: Hey, I'm not done! I'm not done. I got my idea for a movie I'd wanna see. So, a movie about any of the games from Failbetter. Failbetter makes like, Fallen London, and Sunless Sea, and Sunless Skies and stuff. And those are just top-down games where you sail a ship or fly a spaceship and stuff, and a lot of the stuff transpires in text, and it's just supposed to be a creepy game where you read about weird creatures and strange places and stuff. I think that anybody who takes the time to make a movie off of that will be good, because they don't have any stupid scenes that they can just copy one-to-one. They have to read to do it. So they'll have to make something that's true to form, and would be— it'd be cool to see the visuals of it, I think. There's shit where like, "Oh, this is just a weird log in space that people live on that just grows fungus everywhere, and everybody's covered in fungus. All the old people come here to get covered in fungus." 

Wayne: They love it. Alright. 

Baaulp: Now, I just have one last note. I like Log's idea, I think you just gotta get weird. I wanna see— now that I think about it, I have an idea— 

Wayne: RUNESCAPE THE MOVIE. 

Wayne: That could be awesome. 

Gir: Wayne just made me think, could you imagine a RuneScape movie where you just see somebody in the background shouting, "I WILL PAY FOR A GIRLFRIEND." 

Wayne: Yeah, you got a movie where the events of the movie are a regular video game movie script, it's just lofty and bad, but in the background there's just a dude hitting a tree the exact same way over and over and over, [crosstalk] and he never moves away. 

Gir: "2K for GF." 

Wayne: And then occasionally the tree just disappears, and he moves to a different one. 

Log: Hey, I just gotta say, fuck Sword Art Online. I've never seen a single episode of it, but I fuckin' hate it. That shit's dumb, right? They don't even have something on that level, like buying gf or whatever, right? They aren't with it, right? Has anybody seen an episode of that? 

Trog: I don't— 

Wayne: No. 

Baaulp: No. 

Gir: No. 

Wayne: [crosstalk] Why would any of us— 

Trog: None of us have seen a single episode of that anime. 

Gir: We don't watch garbage! 

Log: It's bullshit. I remember— I've only ever seen one or two episodes of .hack//Sign, but there was a scene from the show where there were just players pinned to a dartboard, and they're throwing darts at them, and they're like, "Hey, why are they pinned to a dartboard?" "Oh, they did some packet editing to change the color of their clothes." "Oh.", and I just thought, "Alright, that's good, I like that. [crosstalk] I'd much rather have them buying gf, but still, that's something." 

Wayne: That is pretty good. 

Log: Fuck Sword Art Online. 

Trog: Uh, okay. My answer is, I agree with Wayne saying Kingdom Hearts the Movie. Live action movie. I would see it day one, I'd stand outside for a week. Beyond that, though, I think Mario Bros., a sequel with all of the same actors. 

Gir: Like the dead ones, even. 

Log: [crosstalk] Yeah. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: Necromancy. 

Trog: CGI. [crosstalk] Carrie Fisher's gonna be in the new Star Wars. 

Baaulp: Hologram. 

Wayne: No, necromancy. I think the CGI approach is lazy, I think we actually have to bring them back. 

Baaulp: Did you hear that Carrie Fisher is gonna be in the next Star Wars movie? 

Wayne: Yeah. 

Gir: 'Cause they had some of the filming done already. 

Baaulp: That's so... agh. 

Gir: They're like, "Welp, we might as well use it." 

Log: Man oh man, I can't wait to see a CGI Lou Albano.  

Trog: Yeah. Man. 

Log: He'll look so good. 

Gir: Next question? 

Trog: Alright, this one— I'm gonna make a rule on this one, and that's; you only get one chance to answer this question, and that's it, okay? Are we all in— 

Gir: Alright. 

Trog: You get one. You can't take it back once you say it. 

Wayne: You have to edit in dramatic music for the silence here. 

Trog: Yeah, put in the "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?" music. 

Log: Does it have to be a real— 

Wayne: That's what I'm hearing in my head right now. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Log: Does it have to be a real clown name that we've seen? 

Trog: No. 

Gir: Got it. Dancing Jacob. 

Trog: Final answer? 

Gir: Final answer. 

Trog: Alright. We'll see who wins at the end. 

Wayne: Oh no. 

Trog: This is really hard. 

Wayne: What I wanna say might be funny, it might not. 

Trog: [crosstalk] That's the trick, man. 

Gir: We'll cut it out if its not. 

Wayne: I mean, do you wanna hear— I was just like, thinking of nothing. Do you wanna hear the first name that popped into my head? 

Trog: I dunno, is that your final answer? You get one choice. 

Wayne: I guess so. It's gonna take too long. I'll just say it, 'cause I don't even care. The first thing that popped in my head was Toffee King, Spitter of Acid. 

Log: Not bad, not bad. 

Trog: That's a pretty— that doesn't sound very jovial, but... 

Wayne: Exactly, and that's why I don't think I like it. 

Log: I dunno, I come up with infinite names, [crosstalk] I just gotta go with one. 

Baaulp: Zap. 

Log: Did you just say Zack? 

Baaulp: Zap. 

Log: Okay. 

Trog: Alright. 

Gir: Spell that for us? 

Baaulp: Z-A-P. 

Gir: Zap. 

Log: Oh, Zap. Why did it sound like you were saying Zack? 

Baaulp: I dunno. 'Cause I have a nasally voice? I dunno. 

Log: Anyways, mine is DJ Caterpillar, [crosstalk] and that's what I'm goin' with. 

Trog: Pretty good. 

Gir: Is he a DJ or clown? It's confusing. 

Trog: Oh man. Puttin' the pressure on me. I'm gonna go with... I'm gonna go with Dimmy Pickles. 

Wayne: Okay. Okay. 

Log: Dimmy Pickles. 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] That sounds real familiar! 

Trog: Dimmy Pickles. 

Wayne: I need a retake. [crosstalk] I know you said only one, I have to break the rules. 

Gir: No. 

Trog: No! You don't get a retake! There's no retake. 

Baaulp: No! No!  

Wayne: It wasn't a clown name, I just said some bullshit! [crosstalk] What clown's gonna spit acid? You wanna burn those children? You wanna ruin their lives? 

Baaulp: That was your one chance! 

Gir: Too bad! Sorry! 

Trog: You can do another one, but we're not gonna cut it out. Everybody shame Wayne. If you're listening to this, write in the comments, [crosstalk] "I shame you, Wayne." 

Baaulp: Throw an egg at his house! 

Trog: [crosstalk] And now you get your second. 

Log: Boooo! Booooo! 

Trog: You get your second one. 

Log: You should've picked the right one the first time! 

Baaulp: If you're listening on the phone, tap your phone aggressively. Shake him up, he's in there. 

Trog: Throw your phone on the concrete and yell. 

Gir: Shout "Crappy Clowner!" 

Log: "You suck!" 

Gir: Fuckin' spit it out! 

Baaulp: Say the clown name, motherfucker! 

Log: Why'd you ask for a second try if you didn't have a name!? 

Trog: This is the future of podcasting, you're fucking this up for all of us! 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Say the clown name! Say the fucking clown name! Don't say—  

Wayne: I can't think of a name! I'm thinking of a specific thing! 

Gir: [crosstalk] Clown me! 

Baaulp: If the next word that comes out of your mouth is not a clown name, I'm gonna be so fucking pissed. 

Wayne: Michael, the Fastest Clown. 

Trog: Alright. 

Wayne: The Speedior. 

Trog Hey kids, let's go see Michael! 

Gir: Nah, [crosstalk] I'd rather go see Dancing Jacob. 

Trog: You fucked it up. 

Wayne: You can't cut out his title! 

Log: Jotex the Speedior is my favorite clown. 

Wayne: That's what it was! I couldn't think of his name being Jotex, that was what I wanted to say. 

Trog: Alright. 

Gir: [crosstalk] Dancing Jacob wins, I swear. 

Wayne: Alright. 

Wayne: One more real question. 

Trog: This was a failure.  

Trog: Alright. Wait, you said one more? [crosstalk] How many are we doing? 

Wayne: One more real question. Last one. 

Trog: One more real question? Alright. 

Wayne: And then I got one. 

Wayne: Immortality apple. 

Gir: [crosstalk] Feces. 

Trog: No. 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Wait, but that would negate it! 

Trog: No, no, no. I'm gonna put down— I'mma lay down some ground rules here, and I'm gonna say it has to be food. 

Baaulp: Aw, I was gonna say dirt. 

Gir: Alright, we're not crawling into fucking MBMBaM territory and questioning what is and isn't food. 

Log: Rye and pumpernickel swirl bread. 

Wayne: Yay, I'm Log's worst enemy, and I get a great sandwich! 

Log: Alright, but I'm gonna stick a wasp underneath your seat as you're about to sit down. 

Wayne: God, fuckin' just— worst enemy's worst last meal. Alright, fuckin' bowl of nails! [crosstalk] Eat up! 

Trog: No, I said it has to be food! It has to be something that someone in the world has eaten before. 

Wayne: Poop. 

Trog: Fuck— no. 

Gir: That's what I said! 

Log: [crosstalk] A lightbulb. 

Trog: You are not— this is not the spirit of the question, I feel like. 

Log: A television set. 

Wayne: Who's eaten a TV set? 

Log: [crosstalk] Someone has done it. 

Baaulp: Someone ate a plane once. 

Gir: Do you remember when you were in high school, and someone would say, "Hey, dump all your food into my plate, and I'll eat it!" 

Trog: What? [crosstalk] No. 

Baaulp: No? Who did that? 

Gir: It was like, somebody's soda, and macaroni, [crosstalk] and a pizza, and fuckin' chips. There was some kid that would eat that! 

Trog: Oh, gross. 

Wayne: What school of a zoo did you go to? 

Gir: There was some kid that would just mix a bunch of random shit, and they're like, "If you give me $5, I'll eat this." That's what I'd feed them. 

Baaulp: Are you sure you weren't hallucinating on a pig farm? 

Gir: No! Okay, I guess you guys didn't go to school with idiots like I did. 

Wayne: One time I took an overripe banana, and a little bit of milk, and some turkey and cheese, and wrapped it up— and mushed it all together, wrapped it up in a paper towel, and I tried to give it to this kid I hate and told him it was a cheeseburger. 

Log: Oh shit, give them Bardonic ramen! 

Trog: [crosstalk] Oh, alright. No way. That's it. That is it. 

Gir: Yeah! Bardonic— yep! Yep! Bardonic ramen. 

Log: Hey, for viewers— 

Gir: We're not explaining it. 

Trog: [crosstalk] We have some homework for you guys. 

Wayne: It'll be in the description, you have to explain it. 

Log: Bardonic ramen is blue like Sonic the Hedgehog, bitches! 

Wayne: What did he cook it in? Powerade? What was it? 

Log: Yeah, yeah, [crosstalk] it's Powerade. 

Trog: I'm pretty sure it was Powerade. 

Wayne: It's ramen boiled in Powerade, and then I think he adds— what was the yellow aspect of it, if it's Bardonic? 

Log: Like a banana or something. 

Gir: [crosstalk] The flavoring. 

Trog: No, I think it was the ramen.  

Wayne: Was it a banana? 

Trog: I think the ramen was it. 

Wayne: Oh no, it was the chicken flavoring! 

Trog: Oh yeah, that's right! 

Wayne: It is blue Powerade ramen, and he still adds the chicken flavoring. 

Trog: I'm pretty sure he puts sprinkles or something on it, too. 

Wayne: Yeah, something like that. 

Log: Yeah. 

Trog: Anyway, go check the description for that video and watch it so you can get this joke. 

Baaulp: Yeah. 

Log: [crosstalk] Want me to tell them the name of the YouTuber? 

Trog: No. Pause the podcast, go watch that video, and come back. 

Log: Yeah, just look for Bardonic ramen. It's available in all stores. 

Baaulp: I was gonna say— I was gonna reference this one time when I was a kid, when Sun Chips first came out, I really liked them, so I bought a huge bag of Sun Chips, I ate the whole bag, it was like a party size bag. I felt really gross and I vomited, I was gonna make them eat that, but nah. It's Bardonic ramen. 

Trog: You can't make somebody eat throw up as their last meal. 

Baaulp: No, not my throw up! I mean, eat Sun Chips until they threw up. 

Trog: Eat Sun Chips! "What's the worst thing you could give to your mortal enemy?" "Uh, here's a bag of Garden Salsa Sun Chips." 

Wayne: [crosstalk] But a lot of them. 

Gir: It's cheating to say you'd give them so much they puke, 'cause then you could just say, [crosstalk] "Oh, I give them ice cream until they die." 

Baaulp: Yeah, your meal's the whole bag! 

Trog: All you can eat slime. You have to eat until they die. 

Gir: Slime. 

Wayne: Oh yeah, my last meal is Gak! 

Gir: Play-Doh! [crosstalk] Play-Doh! 

Trog: I'm pretty sure it's mostly corn syurp, so... 

Baaulp: Yeah, it probably wouldn't be that bad. 

Gir: [crosstalk] Make them eat Play-Doh. 

Wayne: You probably couldn't swallow it! It was probably too sticky. 

Gir: Glue? 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] We're going down a dangerous road here. 

Wayne: You probably couldn't swallow a wad of corn starch, I think it's too dry, I dunno. 

Log: Eat some lead pita chips. 

Baaulp: Was that the last question or do we have another question? 

Wayne: [crosstalk] I have the last question. 

Gir: Wayne's got the final question. 

Trog: Alright. 

Wayne: Alright, are you guys ready? 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah. 

Gir: Yeah. 

Trog: Yeah. 

Gir: Yeah, somebody caught me being aflame once. 

Baaulp: Hey, I got you covered. The answer is all of us, we're all dead. 

Trog: Oh, [crosstalk] you weren't supposed to say that 'till the season finale. 

Gir: Okay, no, I can wrap this around to the very start, [crosstalk] where I was not on fire, but my friends bushes were. 

Baaulp: Oh, do that. 

Log: Well, who gives a fuck about that? 

Wayne: Yeah? 

Gir: His family, when they went outside and saw their bushes on fire. 

Wayne: That's like someone asks, "Hey, you ever broken a bone?" "No, my friend did, though." 

Log: There was somebody I knew that did a fuckin' little stunt, where they would spray perfume on themselves and then light it on fire, [crosstalk] and then put it out. 

Trog: What the fuck? 

Log: Apparently it didn't burn them, [crosstalk] so I guess that's okay. 

Gir: It's 'cause it was burning the perfume, not them. 

Log: Yeah, yeah. 

Gir: You do the same thing with alcohol. 

Log: But yeah, that's what they would do. 

Gir: I don't think anyone here has ever been lit aflame. 

Trog: No. I have not. 

Log: Nuh uh. 

Baaulp: No. 

Gir: Kind of a weak final question there. 

Log: Maybe we shouldn't have answered it. 

Wayne: That was the point. 

Log: Well, you should have told us. 

Trog: You should have said, "Here's a question, don't answer this one, though." 

Wayne: Alright, then I have another one we won't answer— [crosstalk] or we could, it's up to you. Ready? 

Trog: Alright. I'll try, I'll always try. 

Wayne: This one is from... do you want me to read the Discord name, because that was what Baaulp was doing? Which is muscle emoji, lip emoji, again lip emoji, thumbs up. 

Trog: I think that's, uh— 

Wayne: Its GrauBun, I know who it is. 

Trog: Oh, yeah yeah yeah. 

Wayne: This question is from GrauBun. "Credit card number and social security number?" 

Gir: Yes, you can tell me. 

Trog: Ooh. 

Wayne: Yes, please give them to us. Put those in the Discord. 

Trog: Yeah, if you wanna participate at home, write your credit card and social security number in the comment box. 

Wayne: Down below in the comments. 

Trog: [crosstalk] And leave it for me. 

Log: Yeah. 

Gir: Don't forget the security code! 

Wayne: Also, I'll need your first name, [crosstalk] and your last name. 

Log: First name. 

Trog: Just that. 

Gir: [crosstalk] Your home address. 

Log: First name, Tamers. 

Trog: Your first name, your nickname, [crosstalk] and your favorite flavor of ice cream. 

Wayne: Your fun name. 

Gir: If you're unfortunate and don't have one of those funny plastic shopping cards, go ahead and just— you can pay us and we'll send you one. 

Trog: Who needs those anymore? I can just walk into pet stores and steal things. 

Gir: I'll just squeak everything I steal. 

Wayne: I think the concept of middle names should be changed, and they should just be called fun names. [crosstalk] Because nobody uses them, they're just for fun. 

Gir: Central names. 

Trog: Can I change my fun name? 

Gir: [crosstalk] No. 

Wayne: Yeah, it's for fun. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Can I change it to Dimmy Pickles? 

Gir: You can only do it for fun. You gotta pick one. 

Wayne: Yeah. 

Trog: Sick. 

Wayne: Alright everybody, well, thank you for listening to The Podcast #1: The Future of Podcasting, now The Past of Podcasting. Tune in next time for The Podcast #2. 

Log: I dare you to find it if you can. 

Baaulp: Charge your phone, because our podcast was so powerful, you probably have 1% battery left. Go. 

Wayne: It absolutely is, [crosstalk] check your fuckin' batteries. 

Gir: That was Baaulp hiding inside your phone. 

Baaulp: I burst your battery open with my sharp front teeth, and I suck out the power. 

Trog: Should we plug the Discord or anything? Or should we plug the stream? 

Wayne: Absolutely. Look down below at the Discord. It's in the description, you can click the link, it's an invite link. You can either join the Discord in your web browser or in your programs. Also, check out twitch.tv/wayneradiotv, the Twitch stream that this podcast is affiliated with, where we play all kinds of fun video games. I play them. 

Gir: We're there too. 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I watch you play them. 

Wayne: They're there, that's kind of just the draw. 

Trog: Yeah. That's it. 

Wayne: [crosstalk] Sometimes we play them together. 

Gir: We'll be there. 

Trog: If you enjoyed this, you'll probably enjoy that. It's like this but somehow even less coordinated. 

Log: Also, check out One Piece. It's pretty good. 

Wayne: Check out logmore.tumblr.com for the quickest art. I mean coolest art. 

Gir: And because we're here at the very end, I'd like to say, if you listened to the entire thing, thank you. If you just skipped here, go fuck yourself. 

Wayne: No one— who skips to the last 10 seconds of a podcast? 

Trog: I do. 

Gir: [crosstalk] Demons. 

Baaulp: That's the juicy bit. 

Wayne: Buh, I wonder— I open up an episode of my favorite podcast, "Mmm, I wonder how the ended this one!" 

Gir: They're like, "Oh, that conversation was boring, let me see if they get onto something different." 

Trog: No, no, no, Wayne, you have it wrong. You open up an episode of your least favorite podcast and skip to the end. 

Gir: "Yeah, fuck these guys! I'm just gonna listen to the end!" 

Baaulp: Hey, everyone, shoutout to, uh, hot dog. 

Trog: Great. Great. 

Wayne: Shoutout. [crosstalk] Followers. 

Trog: Great. Great. Great. Where do I begin? [crosstalk] Fuck you. 

Wayne: Goodnight everybody. 

Trog: Fuck you. 

Gir: Fuck you.

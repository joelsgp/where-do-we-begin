[Intro music “Wild Winds of Home” by Yin Xia plays, then fades at 0:27]

Wayne: I don't- I don't know- I don't know where we begin but, where- where do we begin? We ask that here tonight, welcome.

Baaulp: How about-

Wayne: Where do we begin?

Baaulp: How about we have a moment of silence for Justin Bieber's new lyme disease?

[Short pause as someone snickers]

Wayne: Uh, cue taps? Play taps?

Baaulp: Yeah

Wayne: For Justin, for Justin Bie- for Justin Beyber? Uh, anyways, yeah, I don't know where we're beginning this but, I kn- I know one thing. You know- you know what I know? I'm Wanye.

Trog: I'm Trog

Log: And I'm Log

Baaulp: I'm Baaulp

Gir: And I'm Gir! And I'm back, after like two months?

Baaulp: You're not sick anymore! Hooray

Gir: I'm not sick and also have time!

Log: He's escaped from his tube

Baaulp: You don't have some sort of fucked up like, migraine or illness, or something?

Gir: No, I'm freed from illness and from holiday retail hell

Wayne: So, what was it like being fed and bathed through a tube?

Baaulp: What?

Gir: Uuuhhhh

Baaulp: Wh- Bathed through a tube? How the fr-

Gir: I was bathed through a tube

Wayne: He was sick. He was sick. Bro, he was so fucking sick

Gir: I had to be put in a cryogenic chamber until they found the cure.

Log: You had to get a intravenous bath.

Baaulp: Yeah, how's that work?

Wayne: Yo, they cleaned my veins out!

Gir: Look, it's really complicated I don't think I could explain it in layman terms.

Wayne: If you don't, I'm gonna end the podcast

Gir: They put tube water-

Log: You know how sweat comes out of your pores? This time it's different.

Baaulp: They put it back in. They put water back in.

Wayne: Pure water comes out.

Trog: What is it like being the first 2020 trans-human? Like, you've ascended, right?

Gir: Uuuhhhh

Trog: That was the procedure?

Gir: It's slightly slow going but it happens.

Wayne: Hey, I want this to be a biology episode, how does sweat molecularly differ from water.

Baaulp: It's salty

Trog: It's got like salt and shit in it

Gir: Salt

Trog: It's- it's your body expelling waste and stuff

Wayne: Uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

Baaulp: Is yours blue like the Gatorade commercials?

Wayne: Yeah, mmhhmmm

Gir: I drink that much Gatorade

Wayne: I drink too much

Baaulp: The first time I learned about Gatorade was from one of the commercials, and I drank it, hoping-

Wayne: You thought it would make you sweat blue?

Baaulp: Yeah, I was too naive and I didn't have a good enough grasp on English and I was a gullible child and was like "Damn, I want that"

Wayne: I was scared- I didn't want to drink it because I didn't want to sweat blue and I didn't want a raptor to come and challenge me.

Baaulp: You were- you were scared? Pussy. I wanted that

Wayne: You embraced it? Then why didn't you drink it?

Baaulp: I did, I said I did and it didn't happen and I was disappointed

Wayne: I used to have a friend that like drank Gatorade like water and it like- I didn't get it. Every time I'd go to his house, the uh, he would just have like so much Gatorade, and like, I didn't get it, but I was down with it, 'cause I was ten and Gatorade was good.

Gir: That's how I am right now, honestly

Wayne: I drank a lot. Like, I didn't even know they made Gatorade containers that big. Like, two fucking gallons.

Gir: Because it one: has sugar so you get energy, and two: has electrolytes so you don't get dehydrated. I drink way too much of that shit when I'm working, to the point that it's bringing around to the uh, the fact that it's the New Year, and that's on my list of shit to stop drinking!

Baaulp: That's your resolution?

Gir: I gotta stop drinking so much Pow- uh, Gatorade, stop drinking so much soda, stop eating so many chips.

Wayne: I gotta ste-op drinking so much pepper. So you know what I was gonna say, a good tip for that- that one thing you said, uh, hydration? Try the uh, water. That keeps you hydrated.

Gir: Yeah, but, also Gatorade has a good flavor. Good smell, flavor.

Trog: And sugar, lots of sugar

Wayne: Water has good flavor

Gir: Water has shit flavor!

Trog: Water has no flavor, it doesn't taste like anything

Wayne: Are you- is that, was that a joke? Was- was that a joke? No-

Gir: Yes that was a joke

Wayne: Okay, good, because I-

Gir: Although, although, although! Arrowhead water has like a weird taste to it, and I've asked other people and other people can confirm that. 

Wayne: That's like the cheap water, right?

Gir: Arrowhead? No, it's expensive, I think they put extra minerals in it which gives it the shitty weird flavor

Wayne: Really? Bro, oh, have you ever had San Pellegrino, that mineral water? I love that shit

Baaulp: Oh, mineral water tastes funky to me, I never like mineral water

Gir: It's not mineral water, it's water with minerals!

Baaulp: Mi- water with minerals in it is mineral water

Wayne: Yes! Why did y- why did you need to state that?

Gir: No, all water has minerals in it, if you're drinking pure water you're gonna fucking die

Trog: Nuh uh

Gir: Yuh huh!

Wayne: Nuh uh

Gir: Uh huh!

Trog: Well, I'mma do it right now

Wayne: I do it every day

Gir: I saw it- I saw it on the news

Wayne: That shit comes out of my tap, that shit's clear, there's nothing in it, like, it's pure.

Gir: It's invisible, silly

Wayne: So, you're- when I asked you if you said that water having a bad flavor was a joke, I- I was just concerned because I worked with a girl for like years, who legitimately said that water tastes bad, so she didn't drink it. She didn't drink water.

Baaulp: Those people scare me

Gir: That sounds like a... like a mental bias

Wayne: All she- all she drank was like, like ginger ale and that shit-

[Baaulp shudders]

Wayne: Soda's a diuretic, how are you getting hu- hydration, how are you alive?

Gir: Ginger ale is something you only drink when you're gonna throw up

Wayne: Naah, ginger ale's tasty, I like ginger ale

Gir: I mean, it's not bad, it's just that's not something I would drink every day.

Baaulp: I looked into this 'cause I was curious, and it's like, you don't have to drink that much water throughout the day because you are getting water through-

Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah, 'cause from your food

Baaulp: Yeah, food, and whatever, so like if she's eating enough food- if she's getting enough water from her f- from her meals, if she's like eating, if she's drinking the soda with her meals then maybe that helps her retain it, I dunno. But yeah, that's not good.

Wayne: It's just- it's so- it's so fucked up to me, I imagine my life where I live like that, and I see myself as grey bones and a grave. I'd be dead.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Like I could- I cannot- listen, at some point in the past like, I-I'd say like, I'd say like towards the end of high school like, I just started chugging and I've never stopped. I love water.

Gir: I w- I would see myself basically the same as I am now, except riddled with kidney stones.

Baaulp: Yeah, there was a kid who drank a like, he was known for drinking a lot of Mountain Dew, he would bring a 2 liter of Mountain Dew to school with him, and by the end of the school day that would be gone.

Wayne: Bro, holy shit

Baaulp: He stopped, because he got an ulcer. [Gir laughs] And I was- and after I heard that, I was like "maybe this soda thing's not so hot"

Wayne: I used to drink a lot of Mountain Dew in high school, and even that, I could never do that.

Baaulp: Yeah, that kid was uhh... went hard.

Gir: I knew a kid who- I think everybody knew a kid like this, but I knew a kid who would drink like 3 to 5 Monsters every single day. [Baaulp groans] I didn't know how he didn't just straight up die from that.

Wayne: I knew someone who who someone who lived like that and had a heart attack at 21. [Baaulp shudders] And then still drinks Monsters to this day.

Gir: Oh my god, what the fuck?

Baaulp: He survived

Wayne: He survived and has not changed

Gir: That's a mistake

Wayne: I mean, he probably has to keep doing it because if he doesn't, he'll fall asleep forever and not die, but be asleep forever

Gir: It's a narcolepsy counter

Baaulp: But the thing is, it's one ingredient that's like keeping you awake. You can just take caffeine pills.

Wayne: Taurine- I'm getting those taurine shots

Gir: Jesus christ.

Baaulp: You're eating ginseng like just, you're just biting into it like a carrot.

Wayne: Fuck yeah. I mean, you could- you could do that, you could get away with that.

Baaulp: It would not be pleasant.

Wayne: Nu- no, but you could do it

Baaulp: Yeah, in theory. Things like ginseng and ginger are like, they're good but-

Wayne: I could eat it straight.

Baaulp: Raw- raw is so harsh. I love ginger snaps

Wayne: I could eat it straight. I'll just like, I bet I could do it. Like, 'cause I will like, if I'm ever like, realize like, "oh man, I haven't had enough veggies in the past few days" I'll just like go to my fridge, grab like a fucking handful of kale, and just eat it.

Baaulp: But do you seriously, okay that's different. Do you seriously think you could bite into a thing of ginger.

Wayne: I could go try. I have ginger downstairs.

Baaulp: Do it on stream

Wayne: On podcast, or on stream?

Baaulp & Gir: On stream

Wayne: Alright, I'll just say like, "yeah I have to do this"

Baaulp: It will not be pleasant. I, like-

Wayne: Bro, I bet it's great-

Gir: It's not great

Wayne: Have you had ginger ale? That shit's delicious

Gir: Dude, it's not great

Wayne: Uh, I don't know what you're talking about. I asked uh, the uh, the madame at the palm reading store and she said it would taste great. The palm reading store... [chuckles]

Baaulp: You should do that, and at the same time I should bite into a ginger snap cookie and we should compare our experiences.

Log: I don't get ginger man. How can it be like that? How can, how can it look like- it's practically like, a small man cursed to be trapped in a root.

Wayne: It's like a mandrake! 

Log: And then it gets converted into like, things that you put on sushi, things that you put in a carbonated drink, things that you put in a cookie? Like, how do they do it, how do they extract it?

Wayne: I mean, you could put anything on a cookie.

Baaulp: I like ginger because it is one of those things that looks as powerful as it tastes and like, you have to cook it down for it to like, be usable. Now, you say how it could be like that, I know how it could be like that, there is this legend of like, this her- Chinese hermit and uh, he basically was a hermit, he- and he is like the grandfather of Chinese medicine- I hope I'm telling this story correctly, just from the tidbits I know- and, he's- he is this because, he just- just wandered around trying every plant himself and just documented the effects. 

Baaulp: Uh, and uh, and I know this because, for some weird reason, he got a lot of boners from trying different plants. That is recorded.

Wayne: Nature is full of aphrodisiacs.

Trog: Or he just really likes plants.

Wayne: I keep eating dirt and popping boners.

Trog: Learning a lot about yourself

Wayne: Or learning a lot about the plants. I think it's more about the plants than me.

Gir: We've all been there

Wayne: I don't think it's a- it's not a personal problem. I'm- I blame it fully on the plants. Botany; it sucks, it keeps giving me boners.

Gir: Wish those plants weren't so fucking sexy.

Baaulp: Auugh...

Wayne: Mmm, aah, mmm, ah...

Trog: Oh! Guys, I just heard from the podcast police, we have to stop doing our podcast now.

Wayne: Oh!

Baaulp: Oh thank god

Trog: Darn. Had a good run.

Wayne: Can we get one final moment of silence for Justin Bieber, who got lyme disease and confirmed it, on public media?

Baaulp: Maybe if he tried more plants, that wouldn't have happened.

Gir: I'm so sorry Justin Beyblade.

Wayne: He... man, augh

Baaulp: See, we were talking about this before the podcast started, I don't feel bad because Justin's Bieb- Just Bieber is rich where like-

Gir: Justin's Bieber

Baaulp: Getting the medicine for- getting the medicine and treatment for lyme disease won't affect him. It'll affect normal people but not him.

Wayne: I also think it's incredibly dumb that he's like, there's- that is- there's like a huge trend of people like "Justin Bieber I'm so sorry you have lyme disease" like it's fucking lyme disease, he doesn't have cancer

Gir: It is not exactly a disease you "come out" with, like-

Wayne: Yeah it's just like, so many people have lyme, like it sucks it's not fun but like-

Gir: Yeah, we have like an aunt with it

Wayne: I have a friend with it and he lived his life very normally, like there would be like- around like one- around like once a year he'd get a bad bout of the sys- of the symptoms, but other than that, he was fine. It's like- but Justin Bieber is also the guy who posted on Instagram like "oh my god guys, I have conjunctivitis" like, he, he makes a-

Gir: Oh yeah, like a fucking-

Wayne: Do you remember that?

Gir: Yes

Baaulp: Do you think his simpsona will have lyme disease now? Or do you think that simpsona will be okay?

Wayne: What the fuck are you talking about?

[Gir says something drowned out]

Baaulp: He got like, he got like Simpsons fanart of him and his wife and he posted it all happy like "Oh check it out, it's dope!"

Wayne: He's married? Damn, time flies. In my head Justin Bieber still looks how he did when he got shot on CSI.

[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

Gir: No, that was real

Trog: So I looked up- I google searched lyme disease to try and get any nugget of comedy out of this conversation, and the first like two results are actually about the disease, and everything else is just about Justin Bieber now, [Baaulp laughs] so I feel sorry for anybody trying to look up information about lyme disease because you're just going to get like, an Entertainment Tonight article that says "Hayley Bieber calls out trolls trying to 'Downplay the Severity of Justin's Lyme Disease'" [Baaulp and Wayne laugh] instead of any actual medical information that may be useful to you, so...

Baaulp: If I was that rich, and I got lyme disease, I wouldn't go to the internet, I'd drop a lot of money on research to find a cure for the shitty disease, instead of like, I dunno

[Wayne cheers and claps]

Wayne: Yes! Yes, unrelated, but Yakuza soundtracks, all of them, are now on spotify. It is a great day. Justin Bieber your lyme disease could not cancel out that great news, I could not be sad about that. But I could always be hype for some fucking Yakuza soundtracks

Trog: Why did- fucking CNN tweeted about this, who gives a shit?

Baaulp: War with Iran, Justin Bieber with lyme disease, those are our two big headlines for today

Wayne: Today- fucking, January 8th, 2020 is the day of annoying celebrity news, today's the day that Justin Bieber announced- "announced" that he had lyme disease- I fucking hate that so much, and uh, Grimes announced her feral pregnancy. I'm like, I hate today.

[Laughter]

Gir: Feral!? [laughs]

Trog: What? 

Baaulp: That's an apt description

Trog: I don't even wanna know what that is, I don't even care, let's not even... let's not even get into that. 

Gir: Yeah, let's skip that

Baaulp: This is not a cel- this, yeah, you know what, this isn't a celebrity podcast

Gir: Yeah, we're not on E!

Trog: We- we are not a celebrity podcast, we are not Entertainment Tonight

Wayne: Like I said, I'm complaining about it, I'm not reporting about it. Fuck you, fuck you m- lyme disease.

Log: We can talk about something positive, we can talk about-

Wayne: Yeah, like Justin Bieber getting lyme disease. [Baaulp laughs] Sorry, no, it's very severe, I shouldn't be downplaying the severity.

Baaulp: All I know about lyme disease is that you can't eat red meat, but other than that, it seems livable.

Wayne: Bodyaches

Baaulp: Bodyaches?

Gir: You get flu symptoms and your whole body hurts. 

Trog: Can we not- can we cut out this entire part where we're talking about lyme disease instead of making jokes and being entertaining?

Wayne: I'm making jokes

Baaulp: I dunno, like, so far this podcast episode has been fifteen minutes of lyme disease talk and about like-

Trog: Yeah, and that's why the fucking podcast police are knocking at my door, they're about to battering rang- battering ram my door down and tell me to unplug the microphone.

Wayne: Remember when we talked about Gatorade? That was nice.

Gir: Yeah!

Wayne: Uh, et's talk about that more

Trog: Yeah that was the first str- that was the first infraction

Baaulp: Was the second infraction me talking about that Chinese hermit?

Wayne: I'm hitting the conversational POW block while Log is jumping, no one else can talk, Log, what's your positive?

Log: Alright, yeah, let's cancel that out, throw that out, replace it with talk about charity, 'cause I'm pretty sure the last podcast that we did happened before the big charity stream right?

Baaulp: Yes

Gir: Yeah

Trog: Yes, it did

Log: So, that was a 24 hour Monkey Ball bonanza, what did you think about it Wayne?

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Bananza

Gir: Banaanza

Log: B- buh- banaaanza

Trog: I get it, 'cause it's bananas

Wayne: I will never forget that, uh for the rest of my days. It was a fucking, it was a dreamlike 24 hours, and I say that in both the fact that it was a very good day, and also it was just like, fucking bizarre.

Wayne: 2019. The year of the bird... probably. As we look back, on our year, and how it went for each and every one of us, we ask ourselves, where did we begin? And where do we begin? My name is Wayne Wayneradio TV, I am joined by...

Trog: I am Trog, and... this year, for me, was the year of the eagle, my favourite bird.

Log: Yeah. And uh, I'm Log, this year I began in a vampire cave close to Riften.

Erarg: You can continue, I want to hear more about it.

Baaulp: Yeah. I'm, I'm curious.

Erarg: I won't explain who I am.

Log: Well... I'm only saying the beginning...

Wayne: Oh, you're leaving us- you're leaving us hanging.

Erarg: Okay. [unintelligible] go into it.

Baaulp: Okay, okay! Yeah, yeah.

Erarg: I am Erarg, and I washed up on a shore without all my memories, and am slowly trying to piece them back together.

Baaulp: I'm Baaulp, and it's the Year of the Pig because that's the Chinese lunar calendar year.

Trog: Hmm... Are we sure, though?

Log: Yeah! I know that because of Granblue Fantasy. Next year is the Year of the Rat. 

Erarg: I'm glad Chinese culture appreciates their contributions to our society.

Wayne: Wait- is it the Year of the Pig?

Baaulp: 2019 is the Year of the Pig. And it's the Year of the Pig until February.

Wayne: Fuck yeah! I think it should be that again. I don't want that to change. Can we ask-- Can we ask them...

Baaulp: Well, it's the Year of the Pig because the pig came last in the race, because it's slow and- and dumb.

Log: Next year is the Year of the Rat. I'm all for that.

Wayne: Oh, fuck yeah! That's two in a row! That's awesome!

Baaulp: The rat came first in the race because the rat is smart and cunning.

Trog: Just like the people on this podcast.

Log: Are cats on the zodiac calendar?

Baaulp: Uh, no - in the Chinese story, the cat did get an invite to the race, but the cat took a nap- It did cat things and it forgot and by the time it realized, the race already started, so it's not in the calendar.

Wayne: Wait, the cat came second in the race?

Baaulp: No, the cat got- wasn't even in the race. The cat got in, the cat got an invitation as one of the like, animals, and it just fell asleep instead.

Wayne: So I think that's bullshit because the cat should have been chasing the mouse- the rat, to the finish line, and therefore it would have came second.

Baaulp: Well, no. It fell asleep, 'cause it was a lazy shit, like all cats are, and forgot.

Wayne: I understand, I understand, but I-I propose a change.

Log: The cat should have shot the rat with its service pistol and then researched the nutrition problem for mantises.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Alright, alright, alright. Hang on. I propose that we make our own zodiac, right now. What comes first? Starting- we're gonna do our own zodiac, what's the first year. 2020. It's gotta be ten years-

Wayne: Does it have to be an animal?

Trog: No, it doesn't- [crosstalk] It could be anything.

Wayne: [crosstalk] It could be anything?

Trog: What is it?

Wayne: Year of the Cheeto.

Baaulp: Wrestling moves.

Wayne: i-Chips... chips...

Trog: [laughing] We're getting some very disparate answers... it's either Cheetos or wrestling moves.

Erarg: We gotta give bugs a year. I think they need one. 

Baaulp: Bugs?

Wayne: Hey, I mean, brands are already becoming all-encompassing. They should now- they should be the years now. They should be in the zodiac.

Erarg: You're gonna be the Year of Bugs, the pig and uh... year of McDonald's.

[Wayne laughs]

Erarg: McDonald's present 2021!

Wayne: Yeah!

Baaulp: Is this a European style, like, monthly - each month is a different sign? 

Trog: No. [crosstalk] It's year.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Or is it like an Asian system where each year is a different, like, sign?

Wayne: Nah, it's the Asian system.

Baaulp: Okay.

Trog: 2020 through 2029, we are determining the- the ten new objects, or items, or ideas of the zodiac.

Wayne: 2020 is bugs, 2021 is McDonald's, 2022 is the Shining Wizard, if we're doing wrestling moves.

Trog: Okay, yeah!

Log: 2023 is months!

Trog: Can we fit the Boogieman somewhere in there?

Baaulp: Sure.

Wayne: No. Impossible. [laughing] Cannot be done.

Erarg: Should we do the Bogeyman, or should we compound to all monsters?

Trog: Okay, you know what, that's more fair. Let's have the Year of the Monsters.

Wayne: That's gonna be a scary one. Not many will survive.

Log: I think 2222 should be the Year of Frankenstein.

Erarg: Okay.

Trog: You're thinking far in the future.

Wayne: He's not gonna make it! He's gonna be dead!

Log: He's already dead.

Wayne: Franke- uh, no. What are you talking about....

Trog: Do you know the whereabouts of Frankenstein? 

Wayne: Did my mom lie to me?

Erarg: If Frankenstein dies they can just make another one. It's like- It's like Groundhog Day. It's like, there's gonna be another groundhog.

Wayne: Log, are you telling me my mom lied to me?

Log: No, Frankenstein lives in the- the vampire cave south of Riften.

Wayne: I have grown up not believing but knowing that Frankenstein is both real and alive. 

Baaulp: So there's one issue, um, and that is, you have to come up with a story as to why these signs are in the order that they are.

Wayne: Oh, shit.

Trog: Well, we just did. We came up with them on a podcast.

Baaulp: The- the signs, in the- in the Asian calendar, are the way they are because--

Wayne: It's a race.

Baaulp: -- they ran, they ran a race, and the- the, y'know, they're going from first place to last place.

Log: Year of the Bugs comes first because they were the first thing to exist.

Erarg: Yeah.

Baaulp: Okay, I like the story so far!

Trog: And McDonald's was the second.

Wayne: The bugs, in the primordial soup, uh, were the- were the spark of all life. And then they- and then they made an McDonald's, the bugs did.

Trog: And then- and then--

Erarg: No, this is- this is just the commercial break! It's the pilot and then the...

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Erarg: Like every story, there has to be a break for, uh...

Wayne: Wait, so first came bugs, and then a McDonald's break, and then they did a Shining Wizard? They did-

Trog: Collectively.

Wayne: The bugs realized they needed to fight.

Log: That's who caused the bugs to evolve.

Wayne: The Shining Wizard? And then that became a wrestling move... So it's not so much that the wrestling moves are the year, but the wrestling move was based on the year. Okay. Alright, so we're doing some retroactive history right now.

Baaulp: Okay.

Trog: I don't even remember what came after that.

Wayne: And then- 2024... So- So the bugs, the bugs, the bugs fucked around in the soup, and then they learned to fight from the wizard. And then the monsters came.

Trog: And then, so that's five... I think 2000- I think 2026 should be Pikmin, 'cause I think that's a good game.

Wayne: We need a new one!

Trog: Yeah. But this one's Pikmin 1.

Wayne: Did you guys play Pikmin 3?

Erarg: No.

Trog: No. Not really.

Wayne: Me neither...

Trog: I bought it.

Wayne: I love Pikmin and, like...

Trog: I didn't play it.

Erarg: I think we as a society peaked when we introduced the concept of the Year of Luigi.

Wayne: That- That feels like so long ago, what year?

Trog: When was that? When was the Year of Luigi?

Wayne: Was it 2016?

Log: That was like, 2012, or some shit.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: I'll research.

Wayne: No way!

Erarg: 2013.

Wayne: No way... I- I feel-- Really! I was still in high school...?

Trog: It was 2013.

Wayne: During the Year of Luigi?

Baaulp: Okay, so we need to move it around so it goes Year of the Bug, Year of the McDonald's, Year of Luigi again...

Wayne: Year of the McDonald's!

Baaulp: And then Year of Shining Wizard, then monsters.

Trog: Then Pikmin. Well, I don't know, I don't know if we can fit two Nintendo properties in there. So I think Luigi will be fine.

Wayne: We'll have to skip 2025.

Trog: I think, so 2026- er, sorry, 20- 2027?

Wayne: No, just skip 2025- what the fuck are you doing, 2026, 2027? Where are we going with this? We didn't pick one for '5.

Trog: I'm getting... lost.

Wayne: Good.

Erarg: Yeah. Bugs are a long-standing concept. Shining Wizards have been around since the dawn of time. Pikmin has only been created, like, not too long ago.

Trog: Right. That's from like 2008, so.

Baaulp: The way it's shaping up so far, this is like, both an explanation for our zodiac, and creation myth. So.

Wayne: Mm-hm.

Baaulp: I mean, it works out, because Pikmin could be like, our crowning achievement for our era.

Wayne: Absolutely.

Baaulp: But then, wait, if that's now, that means we're predicting the future with our zodiac.

Trog: Yeah, so what comes after now? What- so the next one is, is like, what we think will happen in the future?

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: So what's next?

Baaulp: Wait, so which year are we on right now?

Trog: I think we're on- I think we're on 2026. But I, I lost track. Several times.

Baaulp: So 2026, 2027... 2028, 2029.. So we need four more, and the last one- the last like, one or two, have to be about how the human race ends.

Log: Uh... So we're talking about like 2030?

Erarg: I was gonna put monsters in twice, then.

Wayne: Yeah, yeah! That's how we end! The monsters come.

Trog: Alright, so monsters can be 2022 and 2029, because they're both the creation and downfall of the human race. 

Wayne: I really hope that like, Universal movie monsters cause the end of the world. Like, Frankenstein just kills everybody!

Erarg: The Invisible Man beats me up in my room!

Wayne: Yeah! Yeah! The swamp thing- Swamp Thing wipes out entire cities! They can't stop him!

[Baaulp laughs]

Log: Year of 2030 is...

Baaulp: No, no! At 2030 it just starts again. We already have that. 

Log: No, let's do it again.

Baaulp: But like, this is- what...?

Trog; Yeah, let's just keep going! This zodiac can be as long as we want it to be!

Baaulp: That is true...

Log: Yeah, let's add another one! Year of 2030 is the Year of Being Able to Print Gifs Onto Paper. 

Wayne: Please! On my shirt, though. Get it on my shirt.

Trog: So after the monsters defeat humanity, then they will discover the technology to print gifs on paper?

Baaulp: We don't get to enjoy it, they do.

Trog: No.

Log: We can create a zodiac calendar for monster civilization.

Baaulp: That is true. I was thinking, like, a 10 year system, but that's because I'm a Westerner, y'know. The Asian calendar is like 12 years, so yeah. We can have more than that.

Trog: Well, if anybody can parse that, and tell us what we just decided on, leave it in the comments, I guess.

Baaulp: We also missed a few years.

Wayne: I- I mean,, really, only thing you need to remember, y'know - 2021, Year of the McDonald's.

Trog: Right.

Wayne: Big Macs... every day. Always.

Trog: So, be prepared for bugs next year, and then Big Macs the year after that.

Wayne: The locusts come. And then you get your Big Macs, if you make it.

Baaulp: If they bring the McRib back in 2021, we called it.

Erarg: You know what the secret ingredient is.

Trog: I don't know if the McRib ever left. I had like, I had a McRib about a month ago. It's okay. Nothin' special...

Baaulp: But then the year after that, wrestlers are gonna come out and beat the shit out of us, every waking moment.

Wayne: Okay, um- what government bodies do you think we can get to like, agree with this?

Baaulp: Uhh...

Wayne: [crosstalk] To like, make it official.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I mean, it's not--

Baaulp: It's not a government thing, it's more of like, a cultural thing. If everyone starts believing in it, then they'll... they'll have to abide.

Trog: That's true.

Wayne: Alright, so we just gotta make everyone believe in it.

Baaulp: Yeah, yep.

Trog: Well, this is the most popular podcast on Earth, so.

Wayne: It's a good thing, yeah, everyone listens to the podcast. We just got a, the equivalent of a YouTube play button but for Spotify, for reaching 7 billion followers. The world badge.

Trog: We got 'em all!

Wayne: We got 'em all!

Trog: The very first podcast to get all the listeners.

Wayne: I'm talking to Larry Tompkins in Minnesota right now -- fuck you. Stop listening. Minus one from our list.

Baaulp: What do you, uhh... So, we're talking about this - how's your year been, overall?

Trog: Year in review.

Wayne: It's been a great year!

Baaulp: Cause in, in last December's podcast, we did talk about, y'know, what we wanted to do for the new year. I said I wanted to do 100 trials, and unfortunately...

Wayne: Oh, yeah! Your hundred trials!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] So I've been pretty se- I've been pretty serious...

Wayne: [crosstalk] Did you do your hundred trials?

Baaulp: I have a list that I keep on my, like, just a list that I- I keep a text file, and every time I work hard on something, that takes effort or time or both, I just write it down there. And unfortunately, I'm at 60.

Trog: Aww.

Wayne: That's pretty good!

Trog: That's pre- yeah, that's over half way. 

Log: Not bad.

Trog: Really, you just set your- you just set the number too high.

Wayne: The one thing that I remember about that is that I specifically told you not to make 100 shitty things, but just to make 100 things.

Baaulp: Yeah...

Wayne: Like, did you remove that stipulation?

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah.

Wayne: Hell yeah.

Baaulp: So I got to 60, yeah.

Wayne: I don't remember what I said.

Trog: I remember what I said.

Wayne: What'd you say?

Trog: I definitely said I was gonna make a video game. Guess what didn't happen, at all, in 2019.

Wayne: You got 11 days.

Trog: That's true, I c- it's not over, so... I could bust one out.

Wayne: Make like a, make like a TI calculator game.

Log: Slap your name onto Trevor's thing.

Trog: Yeah, sure. That'll work.

Erarg: Get a special thanks credit.

Wayne: Write a line of code for him, and then you legally have to make half the money.

Erarg: My name is on Kickstarters that came out this year, in the credits. So technically, I helped make them.

Trog: Oh yeah, there you go! Perfect.

Log: Oh, yeah! I just remembered! You were talking about Invisi- Indivisible, right?

Erarg: Indivisible, I also backed Hypnospace.

Log: I just remembered--

Baaulp: Hell yeah!

Wayne: Yeah!

Log: I just remembered, because you said that, I backed Indivisible back in like, 2016 or whatever, I am most definitely on their credits as Log "Pasta Tom" More.

[Trog and Wayne laugh]

Trog: Hell yeah!

Wayne: Did you see it? Did you play the game to completion?

Trog: Oh, now you have to beat the game.

Log: I just remembered that, so I'm gonna have to see it.

Wayne: That's fucking great.

Baaulp: That's the best way to get me to play your game, if you tell me that I'm in the credits.

Erarg: Oh yeah, it was those two, it was also Bloodstained and Bug Fables. Those all... k- I had a lot of money like, three years ago, and I bought all these games-- 

Trog: Oh yeah!

Erarg: --and like, oh shit, now I get free games when I didn't have a job, and...

Trog: Hell yeah! Worked out perfect.

Baaulp: Log, you meet your, yearly thing?

Trog: What was Log's? You remember?

Log: My... My resolution was to start and put out the first, uh, chapter of a comic before my birthday.

Baaulp: Ooo!

Log: And I most definitely did that. I done went and creamed it, as they say.

Baaulp: Uhh, I would not use those words, but sure.

Trog: Is that what they say? What do they say that about?

Erarg: I don't-- They say about something negative or positive? I don't understand.

Wayne: Who said 'I done went and creamed it'?

Log: Uhh... one of the, wet cowboys.

Baaulp: Alright, alright! Yeah.

Wayne: The, the- oh yeah, the famous wet cowboys.

Baaulp: Okay.

Wayne: I remember mine, sort of. I think it had something to do with lines of like, make videos regularly, and go hard, and make this your best year... And I started doing that. And then I- I, I stopped. But I had my most successful video ever this year, so! Let's hope that I can do the same, if I could top myself in 2020.

Trog: So, so so far...

Wayne: Or maybe I'll do that one in 2019, wink wink, nudge nudge.

Trog: And then unfortunately I don't, I don't believe Erarg was on that... Was Erarg on that one?

Erarg: No! It was Gir, and he can't...

Trog: Okay, so not counting Erarg-

Wayne: [crosstalk, under Trog] We don't know what his was. 

Trog: So we have Log at 100% percent completion rate. We have-

Log: I'm at like 800% completion. 

Wayne: Woo!

Trog: Yeah. Log at 800, went the extra mile. We have Baaulp at like a 60%-

Wayne: [crosstalk] Baaulp at 60- 

Trog: What'd you say? 66?

Baaulp: It was 60, so I'm at 60% completion rate.

Trog: 60. So you're at 60%... I'll give Wayne like, y'know, 50, since that sounds about right. And...

Wayne: The success of the one thing counterbalances the fact that I didn't do it consistently.

Trog: Right. And then I'm sitting at... I'm sitting at 0%, so. My priorities realigned pretty quickly last year.

Baaulp: Uhh... We'll have to report in with Gir when he's back on the podcast.

Trog: My priorities realigned pretty quickly after the release of the video game Destiny 2, actually.

Log: It's okay, I'll give you guys some of my percent.

Trog: Yeah. I'll just, I'll take 10% of Log's and I will retroactively, I'll play like a turnback card like in Uno and I'll go back and say that my real goal was to play Destiny for like, 400 hours in the last 3 months. And I did it!

Wayne: Woo!

Baaulp: Congrats.

Trog: Yay, I have a problem.

Wayne: I'm going to use my 100 points from Log to also change my, my goal, and retroactively my goal for 2019 was to run over a streetlight. And I did it.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Congratulations!

Wayne: I did it. I n- I didn't think it would happen, 'cause like, it's tough, cause the- the first thing that has to happen is that the streetlight needs to be fallen over first, and like, every time I drove past a streetlight they were always standing upwards.

Erarg: GTA belie- leads me to believe that streetlights are...

Wayne: That those things come down easy?

Erarg: That those things come down easy, or at least, easier than a tree, or a mailbox, some times.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Usually a mailbox.

Baaulp: Trees are invincible, but streetlights are like, made out of taffy.

Wayne: And bushes.

Trog: And it doesn't like, hurt your car at all to run over them, actually, according to GTA, so.

Wayne: The streetlights in video- just, any driving video game, you tap that shit and it pops out of the ground. Like, you ever t- like, looked at the bottom of a streetlight? Especially one on a highway? That thing- that's a thick piece of metal! That's a thick piece of- of, like, of- of welding prowess! That thing is attached to the ground!

Erarg: It's got electric stuff in it! If it breaks...

Trog: It's not good.

Erarg: Sparks fly!

Trog: You don't want that.

Wayne: Shocks your whole car! You immediately get electrocuted if you hit a street light. So, I mean, I guess I can elaborate. Uh, was this... Tuesday night? Was this-

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Yeah, yeah.

Baaulp: This was Tuesday night.

Wayne: Tuesday night, on my way home from work, it was, uh, we were getting hit by and uh, freezing rain. And uh, so the roads were snowy and icy and all that, and I uh, went to drive home, and about five minutes into my commute, I see someone pulled over on the side of the road. Their emergency lights are on. And I'm like, "Ok, yeah, it's a bad storm. People who- people who have shit cars that can't handle it, they pull over to like, brake for a moment and wait for like, a plow to come by, or something. Um, so I th- I thought nothing of it. And I continued to go, 50 mile per hour road, 40 miles per hour.

Wayne: The, umm, which like, in snow? My car can handle that, generally. This road turned out, as I went, the snow got worse.

Baaalp: Uh-oh.

Wayne: And uh, like, maybe like less than a quarter mile down the road from that stopped car, all of a sudden I see more stopped cars, and I'm like, "Oh shit, what the fuck's going on?" And with the snow I couldn't see, and then I see about maybe 150 feet in front of me, mm, street light. Just in the middle of the road, just crossing over the entire thing. And I'm in the discord with- with all these guys here, and I'm just like, "Oh shit-", I don't- I don't even-- do you remember-- Baaulp, you were- who was here for that?

Trog: You just said 'oh god' about four times and then we heard, like, a bump and then "oh shit!" and then like-!

Baaulp: Yeah, we were pretty scared.

Trog: It was very worrying.

Wayne: The like, yeah, I like, I don't think I like explained, 'Oh god, there's a street light-', I just went like "Oh god, oh shit!"

Trog: No, you just said 'Oh god' a lot!

Wayne: As I slammed the breaks and the ice made it unable for my car to stop, and like, because of the position of the street light, I also couldn't turn? And if I turned too hard I was bound to flip my car, so I'm just like, "oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, shit shit shit!" And like, and just, ba-dum ba-dum ba-dum ba-dum, my car just went like, fucking, clean over that thing. Bumping up and down, and immediately it banks me onto the side of the road. Luckily there was a big curb and no like, ravines or anything.

Wayne: Actually, if I kept going, there was a hill down there, that I could have fallen down. But my car's stopped, and I'm just like, sitting there wide-eyed, like, "Well that- fucking, just happened." I'm still in the discord, I'm just like, "Hey guys, I just ran over a street light. Um, I gotta go." And I left the discord, and I get out of my car, and I see-  and I can see clearly now, that there are two cars parked in front of me. One about like fifty feet away, and one that's like, more than a half mile away that I can like, barely see. Um... maybe not a half mile, that's a while. 

Wayne: But um, uhh, and the lady's like, the lady who was driving the car in front of me is out of her car, just looking at it with her hand on her heads, and I get out and I'm like, and I call out to her like, "Are you guys okay?" And she's like, "Did you just run over a fucking street light?!" And I was like, "Yeah! Yeah!" And she was like, "We did too!"

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: And like, and she's- and she's just like, "Oh my fuckin' god!" And just like walking around over there, and uh, all of a sudden like a private plow - like a private-owned plow - comes by and like, pushes the like, almost- almost immediately after all this happened they pushed the streetlight out of the way, before I could get like a picture of it or anything.

Wayne: And they pull up to me and they ask me if I'm okay, I'm like "Yeah," they check out my car, um, and my car's just... So, they, they- they put their head under the hood to like, check for any like, leaks or engine damage, and it's like, "Okay, no problems here," uh, all my tires were fine, the only damage I took - that I know of at the moment - was like, my fender came off a little bit. And I was like-- and they were like, "Dude, you got fucking lucky." And I'm like, "Yeah, yeah. I'm very grateful," um--

Baaulp: They softened it up for you.

Wayne: Yeah, and then they uh, then they go to the next lady's car and uh, and I just kinda hear them go like "Ohh..." Uh, apparently her like, front tire exploded.

Baaulp: Oh, shit!

Gir: [inhales sharply] [unintelligible]

Wayne: And like, they took some other number of damages to the car. Uh, they were fucked. And apparently the like, the attachment point was too rusted to attach a new tire, so their car was totaled. Um, the uh- Maybe, I don't know if they were fully totaled. [crosstalk] But they got off way worse than I--

Baaulp: You are lucky.

Wayne: And the guy who was way down the road from me was the guy who hit the street light and knocked it over, so he was at fault.

Baaulp: Ooh.

Wayne: I didn't see- they didn't, they didn't...

Baaulp: Maybe they do come down easy, like in GTA.

Wayne: Maybe! Maybe, 'cause like, they didn't immediately like rush the ambulance over to the first car. In fact, it seemed like they checked him out last. Um, the... Yeah, so I don't- I don't, maybe they do come down easy. Uh, viewers at home, test it. Test it and send us your results.

Log: I'm just thinking, like, up in New England, they know what's, they know what's gonna happen. They know what's coming. They don't reinforce them street poles...

Wayne: Well, that might kill people. I think it's safer to make them easily knocked down so the force isn't distributed to the car.

Trog: Yeah, I was about to say.

Log: They should put, just like, the rubbery stuff from playgrounds at the base so it's okay.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Yeah, why don't they just put like, the repulsion gel from Portal 2 on there? Like why don't they just do that?

Trog: Why don't we just walk everywhere?

Wayne: Why don't they just make them like, like, Danny Phantom phase out of reality whenever you drive through them?

Log: Why don't they just put them on legs so they can walk around?

Wayne: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I see Trog shaking his head--

Baaulp: What about the opposite direction, and we replace all regular cars with like, play toy cars?

Wayne: [laughs] Yeah!

Erarg: If I were driving a car I would simply not crash it.

Log: Why don't they just hire Dahir Insaat to attach all of the street lights to like, zip lines that loom- that loom over the highway! [laughs]

[Baaulp laughs]

Erarg: They like, interconnect with each other!

Baaulp: Make 'em out of hay!

Trog: This is sounding like a Strand game or something.

[Wayne and Trog laugh]

Wayne: Can we- can we make the streetlights out of hay? I really like that idea.

Trog: What if we just teleported?

Baaulp: Dahit Insaat had like, this crazy thing where it's like, they, they like, use like hay for everything, and like other shitty materials.

Wayne: Oh yeah, that's right! They used hay for like, insulation.

Trog: Yeah. Bad idea.

Wayne: What the fuck are they doing?

Baaulp: There was one video where they had hay for like, skyscrapers. Like, that was what they were gonna make shit out of and like, stuff like that. It's like, I don't know how that would work.

Log: 'We're gonna make our skyscrapers out of hay and wood mush.'

Trog: I think we should maybe give a little bit of context here just for people who don't know. Go onto YouTube and look up 'Dahir Insaat', spelled D-A-H-I-R, I-N-S-A-A-T. Just, go look it up, watch a couple videos, it'll all make sense.

Wayne: I don't know if 'it'll all make sense' is the right way...

Erarg: I don't know if these guys make any money off of what they do, I don't know what they specifically - if any of the things they have showcased probably every have been made,

Trog: No. Absolutely not, that much I can tell you.

Wayne: [laughing] Never!

Erarg: I think they just exist as 3D model creators and animators just making a- like, the...

Wayne: Inventions to try to sell to people.

Erarg: Yeah.

Log: It's like Animusic for military grade weapons.

Trog: [laughs] That's the best way I've ever heard anybody describe that!

Erarg: It's like, trying to like, all those like, life hack clickbait videos. What if they tried to make them, like full-scale and like, real inventions?

Trog: Yeah, what if we tried to build an apartment complex out of Popsicle sticks and motors?

Erarg: What if we tried to make a grocery store where you drove through it?

Wayne: Now, you say that none of these have been created, but some of them - if they were, we wouldn't know. Watch- fuckin', a month from now, White House? Gonna get lit up by a fruit truck.  

Erarg: Oh, shit.

Wayne: It's gonna be destroyed by a fruit truck drone. It's going to happen.

Trog: That's true, there are secretive government - what do you even call them? Attack drones?

Baaulp: I, I don't know what the fuck they are.

Wayne: They're like, concealed attack drones - they're like-- it's the stupidest fucking thing! So, the very first Dahir Insaat video that we found, and the one that we- made us enamored with this company, um-- it's not even a company! It's probably just like, two guys.

Trog: It's a company.

Wayne: Is it a whole-ass company, that does this shit?

Trog: It says- okay, Wikipedia labels it as a company, but y'know. 

Wayne: Like, okay. So, they fuckin', so the very first video that we watched was, of like -- I don't even remember what they- if it had like, a name for it. It was like, 'Concealed Fruit Truck', like, 'Attack Vehicle'. And it's like...

Wayne: A fuckin' truck- it's just a truck with a label on the side that says "Fresh Fruit". And it drives around and it shows you this truck driving around for a while with 2 guys on motorcycles trailing- trailing behind. And all of a sudden they cut off the highway, and you're like, 'Oh, where are they going? Are they delivering some fresh fruits to like, a compound out in the middle of nowhere?' Um, but no, they drive out into the middle of the woods. And then it cuts and you see, the air force base. The American air force base. And it is bring your plane to the strip day...

Baaulp: Every plane is on the runway, but they're not taking off, they're just there!

Trog: Just sittin' there!

Erarg: Every plane, tank, and like, car, is like, in a- is like in a grid, like breakneck traffic. Even like the jet planes that need like a full track to go off, they're all just going off at once, right next to each other.

Wayne: They've got every piece of military equipment they've ever made on the strips. And the strips- it's just for miles, there's these fucking jets. And, the- so it cuts to that, and you're like, 'Oh, that's, that's great, that's awesome,' and then it cuts back to the forest, and the truck pulls up to a clearing. Uh, the- all of a sudden, the walls, they come down. The walls of the, uh... the container. What do you call that? The, fuckin'...

Baaulp: Like, the side panels come down.

Wayne: Like, the cargo.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Yeah, the side-panels of the truck of the cargo area come down to reveal, like, just this- you can't even tell what it is at first. It's just like a stack of like, contraptions and metal and blades.

Baaulp: It's like a stack of blades, basically.

Log: Yeah, a million s- a million slats transform into a giant drone that hovers into the sky and unloads a missile silo.

Erarg: There's a bunch of part- there's like, it's all condensed in this box like a Swiss Army knife that folds open and like, all the blades and like, it folds out into like, an arm, which has another thing that extends which has helicopter blades on 'em and it's like four like a quad, like a quad drone.  And they all start- the guy's like connecting shit together by hand.

Trog: Yeah, he's doing it by hand! For some reason it can't be completely autonomous, they have to have a dude there to like, plug in the wires.

Erarg: They have the guy to like, put the bullets from like, the container into the minigun that unfolds before the thing takes off!

Baaulp: Well, you don't want to take away everybody's job, y'know? You don't want to take away everybody's job.

Erarg: And like, like, full umbilical cord still to the base. It's not even like autonomous on its own.

Wayne: Yeah! Oh, yeah! It like, doesn't it fly into the sky and it's like, still attached to the ground?

Erarg: Yeah!

Wayne: Like...

Baaulp: Yes.

Wayne: Yeah!

Baaulp: And it's also like, operated from a tablet.

Trog: Yeah, it's like an iPad!

Wayne: Yeah, it's operated from a tablet, the two guys stand there, and like, they- my favourite part of this is that- so they deploy it in this forest and it flies up into the air and it turns out this forest is within like, a few miles of the air force base, and my favourite fuckin' part of this is that it just goes up, so like in order to use this drone, you cannot fly it to its destination - it must be driven to a spot that is concealed and close enough to the point of attack to hit it with like, machine gun fire, and it can only stay right there!

Trog: Yeah, because it's con- it's connected to the ground!

Wayne: It's connected to the ground! And it just, so it flies up into the sky, it opens up its miniguns, and it just hails fucking fire down onto the fuckin' air force base. It lights up every jet. And people are just like, running away from their jets because they're getting owned by the Dahir Insaat gun.

Baaulp: Not like they could deploy the planes that they already had ready to deploy.

Wayne: Well no they can't - 'cause they're too close together!

Trog: They're too scared.

Wayne: There's not enough room to take off for anybody!

Baaulp: Ah, what an oversight, what an oversight!

Wayne: No-one can take off, and like, they're close-- despite being close enough to hit them with a minigun, they didn't pop up on like any like, sonar or anything, it's just... it's amazing.

Baaulp: There's also no outposts around the base to y'know, watch for people coming towards it at all.

Trog: Okay, but that's the thing, Baaulp, that's the thing, who would suspect a fruit truck? That's the point.

Log: Who would suspect a semi-truck that says 'Fruit' on the side, and nothing else?

Trog: 'Fresh Fruits' on the side!

Baaulp: Ah, you're right, you're right! They're- they're just like, 'Oh, this is our fruit shipment, come on through!'

Trog: Yeah. It just so happened that they were expecting a fruit shipment today, so they didn't think anything of it.

Erarg: It's believable that like, you get the truck like off the highway and like into a grassy patch near a park or something, and like maybe like, have some area to set up an encampment or something. The funny thing is it tries to go even further than that when it gets like, the Deluxe version and it shows that there is five trucks that are all fruit trucks--

Trog: Oh, right!

Erarg: -- and they have to arrange themselves in a like a...

Trog: It's like a Voltron like-

Baaulp: Yeah! 

Trog: It- it's combines!

Erarg: It combines into like, one gigantic drone.

Baaulp: Yeah. And if you, if you get that version, you can straight up take down a fuckin' uh, aircraft carrier.

Erarg: Yeah.

Wayne: Yeah!

Baaulp: Like, it just sinks it!

Wayne: They attack an aircraft carrier, they attack a mansion which is like, equivalent to the White House...

Baaulp: My favourite part of this is that like, assuming this all works, this is definitely against like, some rule of war. Like... 

Wayne: You can't put your weapons in fruit trucks.

Trog: The Geneva Convention says no fruit trucks, sorry.

Baaulp: Yeah, I'm not an expert, but I bet you if I y'know skim through the Geneva Conventions, that there's something about not having stuff like this. Maybe, I dunno.

Wayne: No, no, not at all. Dahir Insaat's void of the Geneva Convention. They don't need to follow it.

Trog: If you'd like to see what we're talking about for yourself, it is called "Dahir Insaat - Unmanned Gun & Missile Copter Container System Combat Simulation [720p]", so.

Baaulp: That's the Video of the Times.

Trog: That's the Video of the Times.

Wayne: I- we're gonna get hit by that in like a couple months. The Russians definitely bought that CG animation that has no details on how you actually create this thing, it's just a fuckin' child's imagination put into a video.

Baaulp: It really is, it really is like that. It really is like, very, like straight out a mind of a child.

Wayne: We can't go into context about every single one, but which Dahir Insaat invention do you think is the most reasonable to become real?

Trog: Oh, the most reasonable? Hmm...

Wayne: Yes.

Log: Uhh, probably the one where it's like a chamber, it's like a robotic bed that traps you if there's an earthquake.

Wayne: Yeah.

Baaulp: [laughs] The hell bed! Yeah.

Wayne: The death box.

Trog: Oh, yeah. Because I think those actually exist. That's like a thing.

Log: Not because it's like - I mean like, there's some variation of that that's out there, I'm pretty sure. But it's like, it's not that it's like good or anything, it's just that all of Dahir Insaat's other ideas are like, large-scale transportation or like, gigantic buildings that require like, a cultural shift to even exist.

Trog: Some of them are like, entire city planning like, 'I've made a self-sufficient city with a 17 mile tall greenhouse in it!' Like, it's crazy!

Erarg: Like, 'What if we made an entire- entire city of like, tubes undernea- under the ground, that'll like deliver packages to you?'

Wayne: 'What if we made a monorail that was actually just a plane tied to some tracks?'

Trog: Oh yeah, I forgot about that one!

Baaulp: [high-pitched with laughter] That was the wildest one!

Trog: That one might be my favourite actually, now that I think about it.

Wayne: That is one of my favourites. That's one of the most outlandish ones.

Log: Wh- what if we put a building on stilts and used it as a trolley?

Wayne: And we made it out of hay? Oh wait, I know what the one you're talking about-- with the fuckin'- it's like a, it's like a bus that is on stilts so it can ride above traffic!

Erarg: Yeah!

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: That's so stupid.

Trog: It really is like, we gave a kid a budget and this is what they came up with.

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: Hey, they didn't even come up with that- with that idea, because I remember- I was, I was a weird kid - I remember being a kid flipping through, uh, Time Magazine in 2010 and like, that was in there. Someone was like, 'Oh, some Chinese company has this as, as an idea! A double decker bus with only the, the second deck, so it can go above traffic!' So that's not, that wasn't even their idea.

Baaulp: I think the most feasible one is the market that you drive through. Not saying it's a good idea but it'd be pretty easy to build [laughs]. Right?

Wayne: [laughs] Oh, man! Trog, do you wanna-

Log: Well, the building would be easy to build. I think the automatic conveyor belt shit would be a bit of a... a bit of a troublesome time.

Baaulp: Well, if you watched that one, even the CGI people are just kind of like, saying 'fuck it' and they're just kind of throwing food at a conveyor belt, like!

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: It's like a weird, fucked up version of The Sims! 

Baaulp: Even in the simulation they're not- they're not taking care of anything! Like, they're just like-

Wayne: Oh my god, a Dahir Insaat video game? I would play the shit out of that.

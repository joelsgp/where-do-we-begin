[Wild Winds of Home by Yin Xia plays, then fades out at 0:27]

Gir: Uhhh, hello!

Wayne: You're not the-- you don't do the intro!

Gir: Well, you're not doing it, bitch!

Wayne: I kick you-- I was thinking of what to say!

Baaulp: We could talk about, uhh, lasagna standards by the USDA.

Wayne: Where do we begin? And you know-- y'know, I know- I know today! Lasagna standards.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Or whatever the fuck you just said. Welcome to Where Do We Begin podcast, episode-

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Ten.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Ten? Is this ten-

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: Wow! Double digits- a round of applause, guys.

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeeeaaah!

Wayne, applauding: [crosstalk] We fuckin' did it!

Gir: [crosstalk] We didn't give up!

Wayne: [crosstalk] We fuckin' did it! Oh my god-

Baaulp: [crosstalk] [laughs] We didn't give up.

Wayne: -ten episodes. Ten episodes.

Log: How many times have I done ten of something? Not many.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Rarely. How does it feel- I don't mean-

Gir: [crosstalk] At least ten times.

Wayne: That sounded mean to you, I mean- that was for me. The- welcome to the- the, the era of double digits! We're gonna be here for quite some time. We're probably gonna be old men by the time we hit episode 100, the way that this podcast works, huh?

Gir: Uh-huh.

Log: Well, I- if we do the fundamental math, it'll be 100 months, just based off of our past, uh, performance. So...

Wayne: 100 months? I'll be like 65 in 100 months! Fuck!

Baaulp: Hey, hey. Change of plans. Let's just record 90 podcasts in a row after this and just bang 'em out. How hard could it be?

Wayne: And then we're done.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: And then we- we get to stop.

Trog: Why don't we just call the next one 100?

Baaulp: No.

Trog: [crosstalk] What's stopping us?

Baaulp: [crosstalk] 'Cause I'm not gonna cheat.

Trog: Loser.

Wayne: This could be 100. This could be our hundredth podcast.

Trog: I say we add an extra zero to the end of this one, and we say that this is officially our 100th podcast. Congratulations, everybody!

Gir: [crosstalk] We did it.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Okay, I think it's a great prank, I think it's a great ploy to get people to listen. Because they go and they look at this podcast and they're like, "damn! 101 episodes? These guys are serious! They're committed!" But, it's a little lie. It's a little prank. It's a little joke. I think that's a great idea. From here on out, this is podcast episode 10. Next episode: 101. There is no 100th episode. [laughs]

Baaulp: Let's, uh, let's do a little exercise real quick.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Think- think ahead-

Trog: [crosstalk] Is it introduce ourselves? Because we didn't do that?

Baaulp: Oh.

Wayne: I'm Wayne.

Trog: I'm Trog.

Log: I'm Log.

Baaulp: I'm Baaulp.

Gir: I'm Gir.

Trog: Wow, everybody sounds real excited.

Wayne: [about Gir] He's not happy about that fact today.

Baaulp: In introducing ourselves I lost my train of thought. Uhh, exercise! Try to think ahead, try to have some foresight. Let's do some crazy, avant-garde shit. Let's steal a topic from ourselves, from episode 100. Let's get in under those fuckers, right, fuck 'em- we're not them yet, so fuck 'em! What is something we can- we can- we would say in our 100th episode?

Wayne: The- the spill cleaning anti-theft robot at Stop & Shop, uh, started, uh, laser blasting all the lettuce and it was really funny. [crosstalk] 'Cause it thought it was stealing-

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Hah, hell yeah!

Trog: It sucks that the moon melted.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, that sucks. But-

Trog: [crosstalk] I miss it.

Gir: I miss my legs.

Log: I'm gonna teleport to Rome next week.

Baaulp: Oh, fuck yeah!

Log: I'm really excited.

Wayne: I think it was funny that Gir got hit by a car.

Baaulp: In episode 100 I would talk about my equinox soup-- wait a minute, that's what I was gonna talk about today. Fuck.

Wayne: Oh, I can't wait. For that. I'm excited. For 100 episodes later, when we get to hear about your equinox soup.

Baaulp: And this episode!

Wayne: [under breath] Fuck. Fuckin' hell- shit. Uh-

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Alright, well, let's get it out of the way. Let's turn- let's get everyone to stop listening to the podcast right off the bat. How was your soup today, Baaulp?

Baaulp: It was really good. It had little balls of dough in it. Uhh, sausage, Chinese sausage, the kind that's red, like preserved- dried pork, dried shrimp, cilantro-- [Wayne imitates snoring] --turnips, cabbage, and fish balls.

[Log howls in laughter]

Gir: Haha! He said 'balls'!

Wayne: I had a horrible dream- I had a horrible dream that Baaulp was telling me about soup balls.

Trog: Baaulp thought that the contents of his soup read off as if it were an instruction booklet was a good topic for the podcast! What a nightmare!

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Jesus Christ, man.

Log: Mmm, I can really taste the dough ball, and, the- Chinese sausage. The taste is, to die for!

Wayne: I know one, I know one person who's gonna be really excited about today's episode. [crosstalk] I won't name names but-

Trog: [crosstalk] Is it Baaulp himself when he relistens to this and thinks about the soup that he ate?

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah!

Wayne: Two people! Two people-

Gir: Yeah! [in a bad impression of Baaulp] Oh, that soup sounded really good!

Wayne: [in the same bad impression] I did a really good job describing that soup, huh.

Log: If you talk about the ingredients, can you taste them? Is that why you do this to us?

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: He recounts-

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: It's his power! His tongue relives every moment as he speaks- the word, the word exits his mouth, the flavour is transmitted with each word. And he re-experiences the moment.

Baaulp: Y'know, I went to a talk once with award-winning author Junot Díaz. And he said, that as a creative, you should gear your work towards a small- as small of an audience of people as possible. And what better content could I make than content for myself?

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: When I listen to this again when I edit it-

Trog: An audience of one!

Wayne: A small as audience of possible: of one!

Baaulp: Yeah! [laughs]

Wayne: Y'know, I went to a talk with famous author Junot Díaz and he said "Baaulp, I'd love to hear the ingredients of your soup. Tell me." And what did you say, Baaulp, what did you tell him?

Baaulp: Turnips, uh, little like balls of dough, cilantro, cabbage, dried shrimp, uhh, salted pork, Chinese red sausage-

Wayne: We're done! We're done.

Gir: Yeah, we- we have to move on.

Baaulp: And fish balls!

Log: I went to a talk with Evo champion Meghan Chips and they taught me how to do the magnetic pulse.

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: Whenever Baaulp just starts listing things off I feel like I can astral project out of my body.

Wayne: I know, I feel it too. Y'know, it'd be nice if Trog edited this podcast, 'cause I could be like, 'hey, can you cut out the part with the soup ingredients?' But no, this is Baaulp's podcast, so he's king! That's not going anywhere! Welcome to the wayhre-egin-- begin podcast, now soup-free, 100%, so! We've had, uh- how long has it been since the last episode?

Trog: A month.

Baaulp: It's been a month. I mean, uhh--

Gir: [in a deep, posh accent] A month.

Baaulp: We're trying, we're trying to keep it steady. We're not on like, a set schedule, but I would like to make an episode once a month. And so far, we're sorta on track, so!

Wayne: On average! We don't need to be 30, 31 days on the dot-

Baaulp: Yeah!

Wayne: -but on a month-ish is fine, and I think that's great and we've been-- let's keep that up.

Baaulp: We're busy people, we have things to go to, things to do.

Wayne: We've had lots of things going on in these past couple weeks, many of us have been to a fair or two. We've been to some, y'know, state fairs, and that's been a lot of fun. Baaulp, and I, and a couple of our pals who are not on the podcast, went to the Big E, which is the biggest fair in New England, I think!

Trog: Okay, I would like-- okay before you start, I would like to throw out a hypothesis. I wanna do a thought excersize.

Baaulp: Okay.

Trog: I want you to start listing off the things you did at the- at your fair, and I'm going to respond with whether or not that was also present at my fair. Because I think all fairs are the same. I think they're all essentially 98.9% the same bullshit, with like .1% of like, whatever region you live in throwing some weird shit in there. But other than that, it's the same.

Wayne: I can guarantee you, you're about to look into an audio mirror. Because everything we did- I know. Like, we don't even have to do this. But, let's go. So, we did: we ate g-- we ate all kinds of bad good food--

Trog: What'd you guys eat?

Baaulp: Corn dogs, turkey legs...

Trog: Yep. We got this.

Wayne: Hey, can I list it? Since you listed off all the soup ingredients?

Baaulp: Yeah, sure!

Wayne: So now I can list off all the fair foods.

Baaulp: Y'know, hey, hey hey hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey. One last thing about the--

Wayne: They had dough balls, salted pork, Chinese fish--

Baaulp: Hey, I could have edited that out if you- we all stopped talking about it! [Wayne and Gir laugh] But you brought it back up, means that it has to go in!

Trog: It has to be in now, it has to stay!

Wayne: The context is necessary!

Baaulp: Yeah! Yeah, yeah, you fucked yourself!

Wayne: Alright, you could play it at 2 times speed. Um, the- oh, that'll be a great segment. But, so-- yeah, we had corn dogs, we had big fat turkey legs; that was the best thing at the fair, honestly-- just those big, giant, monstrous, burnt-- like, charred turkey legs. Ugh, It was amazing. We had poutine, we had, um, chompers- I bet-- no, you know what? You were saying "I bet I've had all these things"? I bet you didn't have a chomper!

Wayne: [crosstalk] Well, and, we'll get into-...

Trog: [crosstalk] Well I'm not-- A Chomper sounds like a Mario enemy, so I don't think so.

Wayne: [laughs] We had Bullet Biils,- [Gir laughs] -we had Hammer Hea- uh, Hammer Bros, uhh...

Trog: Hammer Bros soup.

Wayne: Alright, I- I'm gonna use my lifeline; Baaulp, what else did we eat?

Baaulp: Uhh, we had like, deep-fried things, the chompers, technically, were deep fried, we had, like, deep-friend oreos- oh wait, no--

Wayne: No we didn't.

Baaulp: It wasn't oreos, we had deep--

Wayne: [laughs] He's already wrong!

Baaulp: We had deep fried- no, we had deep-fried Reese's cups! [crosstalk] That's what we had!

Wayne: [crosstalk] It was deep-fried Reese's-

Trog: That sounds good.

Wayne: Reese's..

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: They were not great.

Trog: [disappointed] Aww.

Wayne: They were kinda- they were cold.

Baaulp: I mean, here's the thing, I won't count the individual food that we ate as something that Trog has to match, 'cause like, it's like-

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Generic fair foods-

Wayne: [crosstalk] He saw all these things, probably.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, exactly.

Wayne: Except for the chompers. You didn't see no chompers.

Trog: So I- yeah, I mean- I ate a corn dog, I had a fried, burnt-end burrito--

Baaulp and Wayne: Oh!

Trog: and, uh, and I also bought fudge. Now I'm going to eat- now I'm going to live taste test this fudge, on the podcast, I've been holding it in my hand, waiting. And now, here- here it is.

Gir: Try it, I like fudge.

Wayne: So, eat the fudge while I talk.

Trog: [crosstalk] Okay.

Wayne: [crosstalk] So the Reese's, the Reese's were bad on two levels. On one level, it was cold, so it was just kinda like eating chocolate peanut butter slop in a bread ball. Um, but it had powdered sugar on it, and I didn't realize how not, like, caked onto it it was, so I took a bite and inhaled a little bit, and just sucked sugar down my lungs. [crosstalk] And then immediately went-

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, it wasn't pleasant.

Wayne: And then immediately wen- and then immediately went like "Phlf!" and like, just fucking, coughed it up all over Kami.

Gir: That's just how that shit works, man! [crosstalk] It's like when you get, like, a Doughboy!

Wayne: [crosstalk] I didn't expect it to be so poofy! ...what the fuck's a Doughboy?

Gir: You've never had a doughboy?

Log: [crosstalk] Pillsbury?

Wayne: [crosstalk] That doesn't sound- I've... I've n... no?

Log: [crosstalk] He's a- he's a little- little tickle, tickle.

Wayne: [crosstalk] That doesn't sound like a thing... that I have... I have ever seen.

Gir: It's just fried dough. It's fried dough with a shitload of powdered sugar on it.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: So, a funnel cake?

Gir: Same thing, yeah.

Baaulp: Sorta?

Log: You poke it in the stomach and it stays that way.

Wayne: I've never had a doughboy.

Trog: My review of the fudge. My fudge is done. I would like to give my official fudge review...?

Baaulp: Alright.

Wayne: Okay-

Trog: It tastes good.

Wayne: I'm waiting with anticipation-

Baaulp: Alright.

Wayne: -That, it, oh fuck. I've gotta get me some of that.

Baaulp: Uhh, can you rate it on a scale of one to ten, ten being the best, one being the worst?

Trog: Well, I don't eat a whole lot of fudge, so I don't have much to go off of, so I'm gonna say perfect ten!

Wayne: Can you rate it on a scale of one to ten, one being the best, and ten being the worst?

Trog: O- One?

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: Alright. That's, see, I need to think of it- I need to think of it that way for it to work, for my brain.

Baaulp, laughing: What?

Gir: I'm sorry you have a shattered mind.

Trog: Okay, so, what else-

Baaulp: Oh shit!

Trog: What else did we do? We got the fried food, fried food is at every fair, that's an easy one. What else?

Baaulp: We actually, we saw a lot of rides, but we didn't really go into them. But it was like generic fair rides, y'know, because it's-

Wayne: The thing is, fair rides are not- you're not there for the rides, because--

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: --there's just, you could get, you could go to a carnival to get the same thing.

Trog: [crosstalk] Fair rides do suck.

Wayne: [crosstalk, sulkily] There's never anything special at a fair.

Trog: Okay, wait, okay so-- did the, did the fair rides at the Big E have air-brushed celebrities on them?

Baaulp: Yes.

Wayne: Uhh, I don't know if we saw any celebrities, we saw the fucked up, like, uh, sloth-dog-man-boy peeing, or whatever-

Baaulp: I have a picture, I will absolutely include it in the description of this episode's podcast.

Wayne: Oh man.

Baaulp: it will be out- I mean you, we've already shown it to you- It is the most fucked up fair airbrush art I've ever fucking seen! It's not just a ripoff of some popular thing, it's not just poorly done, it's like- it is, it is fetish art. It is, it is just straight up fetish art. On the side of a child's fun house at the fair.

Wayne: It skirts the line between being straight up fetish art and being just some weird, like, fair spray paint art.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: It skirts the line in a way that makes me feel so uncomfortable and bad. It's just...awful. It's the worst thing I've ever seen, made by human hands.

Gir: You've never been onto- in a foreign fair, then, because...

Wayne: It's worse than WMD.

Gir: Like, when I- when I was in Germany, one of the local fairs run there-- you know, nudity is not as offensive in Germany as it is in America. So, when you see some airbrushed art on the side of a carnival ride, you're gonna see some big ol' airburshed tiddies.

Baaulp: Well, here's the thing, is it like--

Wayne: Come into the tit fun house. Get your face smacked around with some tits!

Trog: Yeah, absolutely.

Baaulp: Is it sexualized?

Gir: Yeah, well, I mean-

Baaulp: Or is it just like a Roman statue sorta deal?

Gir: It's not Roman- are you fuckin' trying to say that there's some Roman statuesque air brush art on the side of a carnival ride somewhere?

Log: [crosstalk] German fairs are very classical!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Hell yeah! Hell yeah!

Trog: Yeah!

Gir: [crosstalk] Then no!

Wayne: [crosstalk] I'm now imagining- you know the, you know the part of those carnival fun houses where you have to run through the punching bags? I'm now imagining that but all, like...nudity'd. Like, you're running through a bunch of nutsacks and shit.

[Gir laughs]

Trog: [sarcastically] Yeah, everybody wants to do that.

Log: You see the airbrushed Birth of Venus, and then you go to the serf petting zoo.

Wayne: And then you go through balls!

Gir: [laughing] You run through the ballshack!

Baaulp: So, to talk about the art that we're- me and Wayne are talking about; I've, I've linked it into the- I uploaded it into the to the- to the call. Uh, look at that. So, this was a fun house, this was one of those fun houses where like, y'know, kids run through-- it was clown themed? And like, all the murals were like, clowns doing fucked up things-

Wayne: No, but it was like, it was like sloth-clown themed! They weren't human clowns, they were all like animal people, pig people-!

Baaulp: Right!

Wayne: I don't know what they are!

Trog: Now, can- you guys have to remember, this is a... this is a, this is a audio medium. You have to describe the picture.

Baaulp: I was gonna describe it, and then I got- I got interrupted! This, the-

Baaulp: The particular artwork I'm talking about, there's a cityscape in the background, it looks like a city street on a foggy day. But there's a female...clown...dog....thing...

Trog: Monkey?

Wayne: She's like a- no, she's a dog, she's a dog woman...

Baaulp: Yeah, with like, high heels and she's holding onto a leash and the leash is tied around another clown's neck who's on all fours walking past a fire hydrant.

Gir: He's givin'...he's giving a thumbs up. 

Wayne: He's wearing- he's wearing a blue, sleeveless shirt, and some shorts, [crosstalk] and he's not giving a thumbs up-

Trog: [crosstalk] He looks very misproportioned.

Wayne: He's pointing, and...he's so fucked up! Everything, I can't- we could talk about this for hours!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah...

Wayne: [crosstalk] He's so bad!

Baaulp: Someone, y'know, I showed this to a- I showed this to someone else, and I don't remember who brought it up, but I showed this to someone else, and they mentioned, y'know, if you look really close at the fire hydrant, there is-

Wayne: This was me.

Baaulp: -a little puddle of pee.

Wayne: I pointed this out. He's-

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: He peed on it.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: He pissed on it. It's- 

Trog: Wow.

Wayne: There's fresh piss on the fire hydrant. [crosstalk] And the- this- this--

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, but pee is yellow, that's white.

Wayne: That means he was-

Trog: He's well-hydrated.

Wayne: Your pee can be clear. That's not white. That just looks like water, he's well-hydrated.

Gir: Okay.

Baaulp: This is just fetish art. Like, there's no- there's no way around it, like, you can't make any- Like you can't make any excuses for it, this isn't like a "haha! look at these funny clowns!", it's like, this is...someone jerked off to this.

Trog: [crosstalk] Hmm, I don't know, I think that it could just be somebody with a really bad sense of humour. 

Wayne: [crosstalk] I don't know, I think it's just very bad.

Trog: And not bad in the sense like, oh, they like racist jokes, bad in the sense that their sense of humour is broken and they don't know what comedy is. They thought this was funny.

Wayne: "What if, what if dogs walked people?" They like, I think- I think the thing that sets it apart from fetish art and why it makes me so mad and upset, is like, it's so- it's too bad. Like-

Trog: It's terrible.

Wayne: There's bad fetish art, of course, but something about this- there's like, there's a- there's a... There's not a lack of effort. It looks like whoever made this tried...? Real hard, but like- just made the worst- 

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: -possible thing. Like, it's- ugh, I wanna stop talking about this.

Baaulp: Yeah, let's- let's, let's move on.

Wayne: There's nothing that can say that can't be experienced by looking at it. So just, scroll down and look at the link that Baaulp posted.

Baaulp: If you're listening to this on Spotify or iTunes or wherever-

Wayne: Go to our Podbean.

Baaulp: Yeah, our- yeah, go- go to the website and the picture will be there waiting for you.

Log: Three-way mix up- fair mural, fetish art, or children's book picture? Who knows.

Trog: Did you guys have, uh, horrible gourds at your fair?

Wayne: Y'know, there were- I wouldn't say the gourds were exceedingly horrible! I saw some gourds. There was like, like- I feel like the, the- the actual vegetable agriculture aspect of the fair was probably smaller than what you have down there. [crosstalk] We saw a lot more livestock than we see vegetables.

Baaulp: [crosstalk, about a picture Trog posted] Ohh! Those are some fucked up gourds!

Trog: Yeah, it's the Na-

Wayne: Huh? [crosstalk] Did y'post a picture...

Trog: [crosstalk] It's the Texas State Horrible Gourd competition.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Oh my God.

Baaulp: [crosstalk, laughing] Holy shit!

Trog: Dee Reichert got first place with their horrible witch pumpkin!

Wayne: We did not, uh... we don't- no, that's fucked up! That's fucked up, man!

Trog: Yeah, post those on the website too!

Baaulp: The Big E was more livestock-centric, so it was a lot of, like-

Wayne: Yeah, they had the fucked up cow contest! It was really sad!

Baaulp: Yeah...yeah.

Wayne: This one we saw was just a head and two legs! It was really bad.

Baaulp: It was more, there was a lot of horses and cows and sheep and goats and stuff. And pigs. Less on the veggies; there was a grange, though. And they were like "oh, look at this big pumpkin!" And... [crosstalk] That was really it.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Was there a big pumpkin? I didn't see the big pumpkin!

Baaulp: It was a, okay sized pumpkin.

Wayne: I might've been more distracted by the guy in a gourd mascot costume. Because I was spending a really- a really hard, long time figuring out what he was? 'Cause at first glance, it wasn't obvious he was a gourd! He looked like some kind of Mario enemy!

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: Like, he was a big green ball with spikes all over him. And a face and eyes. And I was like, I was talking to- I was talking to my boys, and was like, 'is he like a- is he like a bomb? Is he- I like, I don't know what-' 

[Gir, Baaulp, and Trog laugh]

Wayne: I couldn't figure out what he was supposed to be!

Baaulp: Yeah, so there was like, you know-- your typical fair contests, there was a butter statue that someone was sculpting, all that stuff.

Trog: Yeah. We had a butter statue, it was- there was a dog, and, uh... some other stuff.

Baaulp: I'm trying to think of things that you would not have at your fair... Oh, uh! The- the, the, like- representations of all the states, which was just a ploy to get people to buy stuff!

Wayne: Yeah, I mean- it's just, it's just an area for local business from each state to occupy.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: But like, the Big E, because it's a multi-state fair and not just Texas, has like- these, these buildings that are not just fair stands, that like, there's one for like Mass, Connecticut, New Hampshire, um, the... and like, all kinds of different states. Not all of them, though. There was no- there was no New York house.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: New York doesn't get one. Get fucked.

Wayne: And inside, would just be like, just places to buy food and candy and different like butter crafts and shit. And uh, out of all the things that I had at the fair, my favourite food at the entire fair was from the fuckin' Connecticut house. Where I live. So it's like, it's not even special! [crosstalk] I didn't even get some exotic New Hampshire, like, maple syrup food!

Trog: [crosstalk] Exotic?

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, 'exotic'.

Wayne: [crosstalk] You know what I mean!

Baaulp: Well, no, for real! I was hoping for like, what- I was hoping for food, it was very disappointing because I was hoping for food and merchandise that was, very state specific?

Wayne: Thing is, American states be the same.

Log: Yeah, how specific can you get with individual states in New England? I don't know anything about most of the states in New England.

Baaulp: Y'know, I was hoping for like - well, Ben 'n' Jerry's was at the Vermont place. And I was hoping for just like, really good ice cream from them.

Log: You just walk into the New Hampshire shack and it's like, "Here we have it! Our New Hampshire exclusive." It's like a...it's like a shoe buckle.

Wayne: Most of them have- had like, most of them had like, syrup...

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: And seafood. 

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: And, like cookies or ice cream or some shit. It was all very same-y.

Baaulp: I wanted a product that was only being made at that state. Which I'm sure there- it has to exist!

Wayne: My favourite food item at the fair was from the Connecticut house. And it was a, like a fried, Philly cheese steak, egg roll. It was so good. It was amazing. I want more of them. And luckily, it's in my state! So I could drive like, 30 minutes and go get one if I wanted to.

Trog: I saw a giant cowboy.

Wayne: A g- okay, I was about to talk about a giant pig, but a giant cowboy?

Trog: Yeah!

Wayne: Like a real-ass man? [crosstalk] How tall was he?

Trog: [crosstalk] He was giant. He burnt down a couple times. It was sad.

[Baaulp laughs]

Log: Yeah. The Texas State Fair has Big Tex, which is a 50ft tall cowboy that waves.

Wayne: How did he burn down?

Log: And... because he has 50ft tall jeans made out of real jean material.

Wayne: Is it real denim?!

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, no, they put real clothes on him.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Real denim? That's crazy! 

Trog: [crosstalk] Just giant clothes.

Wayne: [crosstalk] That's fucking wild. 

Baaulp: I didn't-- I didn't know that! 

Wayne: Can I buy his pants? [crosstalk] I just want like a--

Trog: [crosstalk] It would be very expensive. 

Wayne: I want 25ft tall jeans! That's so funny! I wanna-- I wanna put them on my roof and let them drape off my house!

Baaulp: I didn't know the-- I knew it was big, I knew Big Tex was big, but I just assumed he was just some giant animatronic statue. And I didn't--

Trog: Nope.

Baaulpo: --know he was covered in like, real fabrics.

Trog: He has real clothes. They actually dress h- he's literally in a different outfit every year.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Holy fuck, I'm looking at pictures of him...

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Really?

Trog: [crosstalk] Yes. It's not even the same clothes.

Wayne: I'm looking at pictures of him, it's kind of scary.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Yeah! He's so- he's like, aw man. He's just the giant cowboy! There he is!

Wayne: How long is he st- AHA! There's a picture of him burning down!

[Baaulp and Gir laugh]

Wayne: Holy shit! Look at this!

Baaulp: Now is he-- holy shit!

Wayne: That's fucking great.

Trog: Yep. 

Baaulp: Well, that just looks like Burning Man, y'know.

Gir: It is a burning man.

Wayne: Burning Tex.

Baaulp: How wild do they get with him? Did they ever switch it up, is he always dressed like a cowboy? Or is it just like, "This year, Big Tex is GOD!"

Trog: No, he's, he's always a cowboy. He's never not a cowboy. Oh, yeah, also-- so Big Tex also-- so he waves, his mouth moves, there's somebody in a booth somewhere that talks to you-- like he, that just says--

Baaulp: Oh shit.

Trog: Y'know, he just goes, "Howdy, folks!"

Baaulp: Is- does he just say slogans, or is the person looking in the crowd and just calling out specific people?

Trog: He's not- no- no, there's too many people to like, call out individual people!

Wayne: No, they need to- they need to improve the animatronics and make him point at, like bend over and point at people. Like-

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah!

Trog: Yeah.

Gir: [in an impression of Big Tex] PICK UP THAT TRASH OR I'LL CRUSH YOU!

Wayne: Like, point so specifically that like, he's leaning over you, the- the hand should be like, a minimum of 10 feet away from you. Like, so close that it's fucking terrifying. 

Trog: He should be able to crush you to death! I want a little fear.

Wayne: [in an impression of Big Tex] Stealing from the fudge stall, are you? I'll squash you, with my Big Texas hand!

[Gir laughs]

Baaulp: There should be invasive, authoritarian face recognition technology so he has names to faces, so he can say like-

Baaulp: [in an impression of Big Tex] Mr. Morrison! I hope you have fun today, with your family!

Gir: [in an impression of Big Tex] You don't want to go back to jail, do ya?

Log: They should put cigars in his hand and he can just hold out his hand to small children.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: He should breathe fire.

Baaulp: I, I will go- I will go to the Texas State Fair if they dress him up uh, in, uh, seapunk fashion one year.

Wayne: They should give him- they should give him a giant fire extinguisher that he's programmed to shoot at himself if he catches on fire.

Baaulp: [in an impression of Big Tex] I'm seapunk this year! It's what's in!

[Wayne laughs]

Wayne: Alright, so last- last week- last month's podcast, we only talked about Sbarro. This month, let's only talk about Big Tex. What else do you like about Big Tex?

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: I think I've had enough Big Tex in my life, living here.

Log: Yeah.

Trog: He's kinda all over the place.

Wayne: How- How old were you when you first saw Big Tex?

Trog: I mean, I was...probably, you know...

Baaulp: Straight outta the womb.

Trog: I- Literally, like, my family took me to the fair every year I was born, and I think I've been to the Texas State Fair every year except for one. I think I've got 25 outta 26 years.

Wayne: When you were like one year old, your earliest memory, was gazing upon Big Tex towering over you, and the one thing you can remember from that moment was fear.

Trog: Yeah, and I've been plotting to kill him ever since.

Gir: [crosstalk] Why do you think he keeps burning down?

Wayne: [crosstalk] "I started the fire! I burned down Big Tex!" 

Gir: Yeah! 

Wayne: God...

Trog: Somebody else got to him first, but they built him back, so it's okay. Now I have my chance.

Wayne: I think burning down- Looking at these pictures, I think burning down Big Tex is the funniest form of arson on the planet. It's so good.

[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

Baaulp: There is nothing else that exists that is more- that would be more fun to burn!

Wayne: I mean, if you burn down a house, that's fucked up, somebody lives there. If you burn down Big Tex, it's- hell yeah, look at him! [laughing] He's on fire!

[Baaulp and Log laugh]

Trog: Yeah, a lot of these look really cool honestly, they look like they'd make good album art or something. Like...

Wayne: They look- yeah, with his hand up like that, it looks like it becomes like a religious photo or some shit. 

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Yeah, it's actually pretty sick.

Wayne: It's like the- it's like the Baphomet pose.

Baaulp: He's some kind of fire god.

Log: I really wonder what could happen in a situation where Big Tex's head is on fire, and only his head.

[Wayne laughs]

Log: [crosstalk] What could've- what could've- what could've occurred-

Trog: I mean, I'm assuming it was probably some kind of electrical fire-

Baaulp: Yeah, that's probably it.

Trog: -that started on his hat or whatever, you know.

Log: Yeah, hydraulic hat. It needs to be able to fly off his head and return, at will.

[Trog laughs]

Baaulp: How could they not see that coming? Like, "Oh, let's wrap up this giant animatronic statue in real fabric!"

Log: It's all about taking the risk.

Trog: I'm just looking at pictures of Big Tex now, he just looks so funny!

Wayne: [laughs] Oh, man- hey, you wanna see a fucked up photo of Big Tex? It's like him in a Christmas outfit, and he's like, he doesn't- something about his face- he looks scary in this one.

Trog: Yeah, that's an old one, for sure.

Wayne: That's a very old one.

Log: [crosstalk] You'll just have to trust us, folks, this is a funny picture of Big Tex.

Wayne: [crosstalk] We'll have some pictures of Big Tex!

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Wayne: Tonight- this week, this month we've got pictures of the times, we don't always do videos of the times anymore.

Log: The more effort that you make viewers have to do, the less... [unintelligible]

Wayne: Ope, and I found a- [crosstalk] I mean, if you just do a google search for Big Tex, on google images, you can find these pictures-

Trog: [crosstalk] Just look up Big Tex, you can't miss it. It's the only thing in the world called Big Tex.

Log: Or go to texasmonthly.com, 'cause I think that's where all these pictures are coming from. 

Baaulp: [in an impression of Big Tex] Oh, I'm dressed as an- as a karate master this year!

Wayne: One year, apparently one year they did a, like a bust of his head in butter. 

Trog: M-hm!

Wayne: That's next level, that's pretty fucking great.

Trog: I remember that year, I- I remember that one.

Log: They make butter sculptures all the time around here.

Baaulp: [still in impression] Watch me do a kickflip! I'm dressed as Tony Hawk this year!

Wayne: They also do butter sculptures at every fair. The one we had was like, in progress, so you like walked up to a little- little house and there was a lady sculpting a boy and his dog in butter.

Log: How much butter do we have?

Wayne: [crosstalk] A lot.

Trog: [crosstalk] Enough to make many statues.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: It's ver- the fair is basically just a celebration of excess, y'know?

Wayne: There are many downsides to the excess of capitalism, but the one thing that's good about it is butter sculptures.

Trog: And corn dogs.

Wayne: It's all I look forward to every year.

Trog: Fucking love corn dogs.

Baaulp: Hey, let's bring up the shit that they for sure did not have at the fair they went to, Wayne. Uh, that guy selling the art- [laughs]

Wayne: So, there's a story that we haven't told you guys about- so you know how like, the fair is a big, big store.

Baaulp: Right, yeah.

Wayne: It's just a big place for people to sell you shit.

Trog: Yeah, basically.

Wayne: So, at the Big E, there were like 3 buildings dedicated to store fronts. Um, and we walked around them, and some of them- we got like, we got some vodka lemonades at one, we tried some monk beer, we got some beer from some dudes dressed up as monks- not dressed up as monks, they were monks-

Baaulp: Yeah, that- that's what you don't have at your fair- monk beer!

Wayne: You don't have monk beer. The monk beer was good. Um, the- but we walked around in one and tried out a bunch of infomercial level products and shit-

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: And then we walked into one where this guy was selling like, three piece, like, canvas, quote-unquote "paintings" that you would put up in your room. And it would be, it would be a picture spread out across three pieces. Most of them were clearly photographs, not paintings, despite it- they were branded as paintings. So there were ones like, 'here's Mount Everest, here's a picture of like, the- the Alpines, the-' and then like, then we saw--

Baaulp: Definitely did not own the rights to them. He did not own the rights to them.

Wayne: No, none of them. And it was just like, this wasn't like, a company selling them. It was just a dude, who made them-

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: -and is selling them at the fair. And he, and then we see a picture of, uh, the Joker, a JPEG of Joker that was probably, in its original form, meant to be 800x600, spread out across three square photo- three square, like, frames. The- and it looks HORRIBLE, like you just took a square picture of the Joker, and just-

Trog: Stretched him?

Wayne: -stretched him out to be three times as wide.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: It looked fuckin' BAD. And the best part, it had a tag on it that said 'sold'. Someone bought it.

Trog: Somebody has that now!

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Someone bought it. And we were all looking at it and laughing at it, and then a dude comes up from behind us, the guy running there, and he sees us all looking at the Joker thing, and he gestures towards it and he says, what did he say, Baaulp? You remember.

Baaulp: He- he said like, "Oh, uh, do you like my art?" Or, paintings?

Wayne: No, what he said- what he said was - "Have you heard of my paintings? Have you seen my paintings?"

Trog: [laughs]

Wayne: As he points to this JPEG of the Joker--

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: And we just, I just looked at him and I was just like, 'yeah man,' and we just walked away.

Gir: Yeah, man.

Wayne: I was too drunk to think - like, I-I got fucked up on that vodka 
lemonade and like - had I been sober, I would have been like 'yeah, that fucking--' I would have- I would have opened up my phone, Google image searched 'joker' and showed him the picture.

Trog: Found it.

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: 'Yo, did you make this? Did you put this on Google images? Wow, bro.'

Baaulp: Like, it would be one thing if he- if this thing was stealing art from artists, but this guy was clearly just going--

Wayne: [laughs] Stealing art from Google images, bro!

Baaulp: Yeah! Yeah, this guy is definitely just typing into Google, going to Google images, and like, printing this shit out onto squares.

Wayne: Y'know, Google Images isn't getting their royalties!

Log: A fun- a fun fact for you, a series of three paintings put together is called a triptych.

Baaulp: Ahh, ooh!

Wayne: Yeah!

Log:
 I think the most- I think the most famous one is probably by Hieronymus Bosch, uh, what's it called... like, the Garden of Temptation or something? And it's that painting that has all the weird fuckers, there's just like - Trumpet Boy, and it's like a- it's like a head and a trumpet with legs walking around and shit like that.

Baaulp: My 
favourite part is, after that guy said that, my eyes turned to one of his quote-unquote "paintings" that was literally just a photo of- the 
black and white photo of the construction workers eating on a ste- 
eating lunch on a steel beam. And he was trying to pass that off as his 
painting.

Baaulp: Like it was so obvious, like it was like- you definitely did not make any of these.

Trog:
 You know, it doesn't take anything other than probably some money to 
pay the fair to be like, 'hey, let me set up a booth'. Y'know, like--

Baaulp:
 They do not check at all. There was another booth selling- it was, they
 were selling basically like those little like, uh, one h- like it just 
had, it was like a little box, it was like a Raspberry Pi with just 
like, tons of Nintendo game ROMs loaded onto it.

Trog: Oh yeah, they sell those at the fair here too.

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah, yeah. They do not check.

Trog: No.

Baaulp: A lot of bogus products... yeah.

Gir:
 I will say, it has been at least 5 years since I last went to a fair 
and the fair I went to, which was here in Vegas, uh, they had a booth 
that was selling bootleg anime figures and, for a child, full-sized 
keyblades, made of real-ass metal.

Trog: Hell yes.

Baaulp: Ohhh!

Wayne: See, but that's- that's dope, both of those are dope. I want bootleg anime figures. I fuckin' love those.

Trog: I want keyblades!

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne:
 I've got a, awful figure of TN, and a figure of like, a note- a 
not-existent Dragon Ball character. He's purple and he's got silver 
Super Saiyan hair. I don't know who he is.

Gir: Yeah, see, I saw 
stuff like that - like it was a green-skinned Goku with blue hair long 
before blue-haired Goku was a thing.

Wayne: FUCK yeah! Fuck- green skin, though?

Gir and Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: [unintelligible] Super, get on that. I can't wait. Yo, he's gonna fight- he's gonna fight El Hermano.

Baaulp: He's gonna fuse with Piccolo.

Trog: Could you imagine? Make it happen.

Wayne: Oh. That's how they bring- that's how they bring Piccolo back on the map.

Gir: Goku Verde.

Wayne: Shit, man. Fuck!

Baaulp:
 Y'know, that would actually be smart. Forget power levels - for some 
reason, th- for some reason, a villian shows up and Goku HAS to fuse 
with Piccolo in order to defeat him. For some reason. It's not about 
power levels--

Trog: Because he needs the ability to rip off his own limbs and grow them back.

Baaulp: Yeah. Yeah!

Trog: And only Piccolo knows how to do that.

Baaulp: Yes, yes!

Wayne:
 I Google image searched 'joker crazy' and try to find the picture and I
 can't find it and I'm getting scared so I have to close the tab.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Yeah, you can't search for the Joker anymore because now you're jus- you'll get the new one.

Wayne: Yeah, most of the ones is the new one. Is it like - I think I found it, I'm not gonna bother linking it though.

Baaulp: Yeah, don't bother.

Wayne: Um, the - 'cause you can imagine, Google image search Joker, there it is.

Wayne:
 Uh, so, at the fair, uh, I- the E-- at the fair, at your fair, they 
definitely had those booths that are like, 'pay a dollar, see the 
world's largest animal!' of like, a certain kind.

Trog: Mm-hm.

Wayne: Like, you had- [stammers] or you had like, do you have the world's tiniest pony over there or something like that?

Trog: We do. We do have the world's smallest pony.

Wayne: And we had the world's tiniest pony, too. So, it might be the same one...?

Trog: So, do you think it's the same pony? And they're flying that sucker across state lines, or...?

Wayne: [laughs] They are! All over the t- all over the place!

Baaulp:
 No, it- it, it's bullshit. They definitely just get the biggest pig/the
 tiniest miniature horse that they can and and they just say, "Alright, 
yeah--"

Wayne: They claim.

Trog: They claim. We have a reptile booth that's like "oh, see the world's only two-headed tortoise!"

Baaulp: I might be horribly wrong, but I think for a dollar, you can't even like take them to court over it.

Trog: No, probably not, who cares?

Wayne:
 The reason I brought this up is because we, we walked past the booth, 
and it's like- it's like, it's so weird how it's like a metal trailer 
with like, curtains over it, so you have to be standing in a very 
specific spot to see the pig. But we had, the world's biggest pig! And 
like, it had signs all over it like,

[35:00]

Wayne: "It's real!", "Money back guarantee!", "It's a real, living pig!" "It's alive!" And it--

Trog: Money back guarantee? ...How does that work?

Wayne: It had s-- yeah, and it wasn't in a-- it, if it wasn't alive--

Gir: If the pig was dead...

Wayne: Yeah, if the pig was dead, they'd give you your money back.

Baaulp: Oh, that's so sad...!

Wayne: And we walked past it, we- we walked past it, and nobody was in there. And I was- and nobody was, nobody was like manning the booth. Both sides of the stairs, no-one's sitting there, so I was like, I just looked, I looked at everybody and I was like, "I'm gonna go see that pig."

Wayne: And I, and I, and I went up on the stairs, and I like, and I kinda- I kinda, I tried to, I kinda tried to hurry my ass up there, and I get like halfway up the, the ramp and all of a sudden we hear, like, this old man go like, "Hey, hey, hey hey hey! You can't do that, you can't do that!" 

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: --and like suddenly this old dude runs over and tries to like, pull me off the thing!  And I'm like, and I, and I go up to him, and I'm like, "Alright man, you caught me." And I gave him a dollar. And I went and- 'cus, otherwise he wasn't gonna let me see the pig. So I gave him the dollar, and I went to go see the pig. And... I don't know if you are ready for this, but the pig was huge. 

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: Um, it was really big. But, not worth my dollar. And honestly after giving him my dollar, I felt bad that I gave him my dollar? Because that's kind of a really shitty trade. That animal was very sad. The... It was big, it was ly- it was too fat to move, it looked like, uh, and I feel bad that I supported it. Down with Big Pig trade. I don't like it anymore.

Baaulp: And tiny horse trade, combination.

Wayne: And tiny horse. Maybe the tiny- y'know, maybe the tiny horse can at least move, so maybe give your money to tiny horse, man, I don't know. I'd have to see it to- to make my assessment.

Baaulp: It's awful, they grow the horse in a mold.

Wayne: It's bad, it's bad. They definitely don't- [laughs] They definitely don't treat it right.

Log: I'm gonna file a class-action lawsuit against the tiniest horse, and they'll all have to give us free credit monitoring for uh, three hours.

Wayne: Nah, you're just gonna get the horse's hay. You're gonna take that hay away from that horse? You think you can- you monster?

Baaulp: In hindsight, you know what you should have done? You should have just went up, looked at it and just- we should have just ran. Like--

Wayne: [crosstalk] I know, I like--

Baaulp: [crosstalk] The three of us should have just ran. Or, four of us.

Wayne: I don't know why in the moment I felt guilty. The moment that I walked away I was like, I fuckin'-  I should have just looked at the pig and went--

Trog: Is that guy like, really gonna- is, does he make his living charging people a dollar to look at a pig?

Wayne: I guess so.

Baaulp: Yeah, probably.

Trog: That cannot be a lucrative business!

Gir: I- It's obviously working! 

Wayne: He sounded super concerned. [crosstalk] About the fact that I was about to get a free look at that pig.

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, 'cause you're probably the only person that has even show interest in seeing the big pig!

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: And therefore he's like, "This is the one guy I'm gonna get in this entire day. I'm gonna make one dollar. I'm gonna make no dollars unless I get this guy."

Wayne: Honestly, maybe that was his plan. Maybe his plan was specifically to be sitting far enough away that it didn't look like he was manning the stand, to trick people into walking up onto the ramp, and then run over there and be like 'you can't be doing that!' and guilt them into the dollar. 'Cause that's what happened to me! I got guilted into the dollar!

Baaulp: Ooo. You know what, that might have been it.

Wayne: I wouldn't have- I wouldn't have given him the dollar!

Trog: What a bad- what a bad grift, though! It's a dollar!

Wayne: It is a bad grift! 

Log: Maybe...

Wayne: 100 dollars to see the big pig. Just bump it up.

Log: Maybe it wasn't even his booth and he just saw you walking up the stairs.

Wayne: Oh my god, I never considered that! He was just an old man!

Trog: No, that- that is, that is, suddenly becomes a very good grift, at that point.

Gir: That's fucking great.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: If it's 'you pretend to man the big pig booth'!

Baaulp: Oh, shit!

Wayne: He was just a dude in a shirt! Eating ice cream!

Trog: It could've- dude, you got- you got scammed.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Oh my god.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Oh...!

Trog: [crosstalk] You just gave that dude a dollar! Log figured it out!

Wayne: I got fuckin' scammed!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Next level!

Wayne: [crosstalk] I got TJX 6'ed! Fuck!

[Baaulp laughs]

Gir: That's incredible. That really is.

Baaulp: That- wh, what is the--

Wayne: I never thought about that, holy shit.

Baaulp: What is the rural- what is the, that guy was the rural New England version of TJX 6. He's a--

Wayne: [laughs] Oh man, I want, I want raps about Big Pig scams! Holy fuck!

[Baaulp laughs]

Log: There's chap hop about you out there, somewhere.

Trog: [crosstalk] Oh man...

Wayne: [crosstalk] Went down to the Big E, I set up my Big Pig stand. Sat next to the ice cream stand and waited for a guy to go up the stairs! Ran over and asked for a dollar, he gave me that dollar.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Went and looked at the pig--

Gir: Now I got a dollar. I just had to holler.

Trog: Essentially, you just gave a dollar to a - [Wayne yells] - beggar! Because there was nothing he could do, like- he couldn't-- if you didn't give him the dollar, what was gonna happen? [crosstalk] Like maybe he'd fight you, but-

Gir: Hey, security! He looked at my pig!

Trog: Would this dude really throw punches over a dollar? Probably not.

Wayne: Aw, I would've fought that guy. [laughs] I could have owned that old man.

Baaulp: In hindsight, we all should have just ran because like, that guy was really old, he could barely run. And he was holding an ice cream cone! [laughs] Like...

[Wayne chuckles, then yells again]

Baaulp: He was in no position to pursue!

Trog: Just knock the ice cream cone out of his hand!

Wayne: I feel so, just- [Baaulp laughs] I feel like a doof. I can't believe that this- [laughs] probably was what happened!

Trog: I can't believe you got tricked.

Wayne: Oh my god. Ugh...

Log: [chuckles] Pullin' one over on ya.

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: Dear diary, I tricked the shit out of some city slicker today! He got to saw the pig and it wasn't even mine!

Wayne: He got to saw the pig... [laughs] He sawed it open!

Trog: Sawed it in half.

Wayne: [crosstalk] One dollar to fucking bone saw this pig!

Trog: [crosstalk] I'd pay a dollar for that.

Wayne: I- No you wouldn't! I don't wanna saw a pig in half!

Wayne: Oh, man.

Trog: But then you could say that you did it.

Wayne: [laughing] What is wrong with you?

Gir: You wouldn't wanna lie!

Log: Could add that to my list of achievements.

Wayne: Oh, man.

Trog: Put it on my resumé. [crosstalk] One time I sawed a pig in half.

Wayne: [crosstalk] That's your- that's your goddamn- [mumbles] Trog's mind has been tainted by RuneScape achievement diaries. He has to do all this inane bullshit to wear the clothes that make you mine better.

Trog: You need a really high Hunter level.

Wayne: Y'know, that would be a good RuneScape grift. Charge someone 10 GP to see the world's smallest... dark wizard, or some shit like that.

Gir: I feel as though we should move on from the fair.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: I think we've covered the most interesting things about the fair.

Baaulp: Yeah, I can't think of anything else that was like, worth bringing up.

Trog: Uh, it was 100 degrees outside and I felt like I was going to die. That's the only other thing that happened at my fair.

Wayne: We- we talked a lot about our fair, was there anything else you wanted to talk about at your fair?

Trog: No- like I said, you've pretty much covered both of them even though--

Baaulp: Nice.

Trog: -- you didn't go to the Texas Fair. All fairs are the same.

Wayne: Yeah. Oh yeah, one last thing.

Wayne: Obviously, fairs got a lot of livestock and shit. They had like a cow show, where they were showing off cows that we walked into, and like, something about it was really funny, being an outsider. 'Cause I don't understand, what, like- Like I mean-

Baaulp: [crosstalk] What they're looking for.

Wayne: [crosstalk] I'd understand the appeal of like, "These are some fine animals," but what they're looking for--

Wayne: All the cows were just standing there. Nothing was happening. And all of a sudden, the crowd started clapping in the middle of nowhere

[Baaulp and Trog laugh] 

Wayne: And I'm just like, I was just looking at it, chuckling to myself, like, "Why are they clapping? Nothing happened."

Trog: Everybody was thinking about cows and just, simultaneously started to applaud.

[Wayne laughs]

Gir: They got really excited.

Baaulp: I also don't know what the criteria is because every cow looked the same to me.

Wayne: That type of cow- I don't know if they were meat cows, or milk cows, but they looked fucked up.

Baaulp: They- they were definitely milk cows.

Wayne: But they- but their, like, their torsos were so large and then their legs were bony as fuck. Are- Do milk cows have a huge rib cage and nothing else? Like...

Gir: That's just how cows are in general.

Wayne: No! Because we- because, but, we saw other cows, that didn't look like that. That didn't have the bony asses. That were fuckin' big and beefy!

Baaulp: I think it depends on the cow.

Gir: It does.

Wayne: Yeah, I guess.

Baaulp: They also have short hair, so you can kinda like, see everything.

Wayne: Cows are cute in the face, if you look at them from behind, they look gross. They fuckin'- specifically those cows, they were so angular and bony. I didn't like it. But...

Gir: That's just how cows are, man!

Wayne: Alright, we're gonna take a wrap on this fair talk, and now it's time for the podcast.

Trog: Alright- three, two, one!

Wayne: Hello, I'm Wayne. Uh... no-one else needs to introduce themselves. Who- what's next?

Trog: I don't know what's next because Destiny 2 has taken over my life in a way that-- 

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: --makes me worried for my- [crosstalk] time.

Wayne: Oh, uh- I'm gonna- I'm gonna. I'm gonna launch the game.

Trog: No. No, you can't. You must stay away.

Wayne: I.. I would like to.

Trog: There's really not much to talk about in terms of- of this topic, but we all just started playing Destiny 2 because it came out, and it sucked away all of my time, and it's a problem.

Wayne: It's great. I don't wanna do anything else. [laughs] It's so good, I fuckin' love it-

Trog: Yeah, it's, it's- I don't even know, it just hits the fucking serotonin directly. [crosstalk] Like I can feel it in my veins-

Wayne: That's the thing, it's engineered- it's engineered to release serotonin. As- as I think the joke I made was, "It procs your serotonin constantly."

[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

Trog: Yeah!

Wayne: Everything you do will just fuckin'-- oh, you shot a gun? Oh, that felt good. That sounded good. It looked good. Oh, you just saw- a big number popped out. Feel happy because you see 4,000 pop out of that dude's soul as you headshot him. Like--

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: It's fuckin'...

Trog: I think Bungie is working with the fucking CIA and Destiny 2 is a psyop. [crosstalk] I am convinced.

Wayne: It's meant to fucking pacify us! Oh, man.

Log: It's not working on me, I guess. So.

Trog: For me, it's like, it fills the void I'm currently lacking from Monster Hunter in that it is a loot treadmill with very in-depth min-maxing that I can spend a lot of time grinding away at. And it just like, it's perfect for me. It's exactly what I'm looking for.

Wayne: I just like shooting those bad dudes with my space gun, man, I love it.

Gir: Yeah.

Baaulp: I like it. I don't know how long I'm gonna stick with it. Like I like it now, and I'm playing with you guys, and I'm playing in solo, but it's like, I don't know how long... 'Cause these games get me, but they don't keep my attention forever. And I can already start it to feel like, to feel it become mindless. 'Cause yeah I'm getting, y'know, cool loot, and cool armour and cool weapons and stuff, but it's like... A'ight. I'm like, yeah. It- this is- this, like you said, it's a treadmill. It's literally just a loop. 

Baaulp: And it's like- I'm, I'm getting to the point where I'm like, I'll remember like, "Hey, I already got this gun before. But now the number is just bigger." and shit like that.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah, but here's the thing-

Trog: [crosstalk] [unintelligible] are bigger.

Wayne: You haven't seen... I will say, with the guns, you do kinda get repeats of the same, like,--

Trog: Yeah. For sure.

Wayne: -- named gun a lot. But you, like, the var- the vari- there's so many variations of perks you haven't seen and stats you haven't seen. I have a lot of time in the game right now, and like I, I know- 

Wayne: I know there's a- like, SO much more I haven't seen of it! Starting that game fresh, right now, with all the DLCs they've made for it, and the quality of the game- it's just crazy. Like I, I can see myself playing this for just- untold hours. I don't know, it's ridiculous.

Baaulp: I definitely want to experience everything, 'cause I feel like, even for a free-to-play game, even without the DLC, I want to like do the- the, the stuff, I just don't know how long that's gonna entertain me, and my- I don't know.

Wayne: My tiny brain is appeased.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, basically.

Wayne: [crosstalk] I will no longer rebel against the government.

Baaulp: I guess me and Log are smarter! Isn't that right, Log.

Gir: Uh, I'm also a little bit on the fence. It doesn't suck all my time away but once I get into it, I definitely do get into it. It's just filling in the hole that's going to be filled with Halo once that's on Steam.

Log: I like playing with you guys for sure. But I think that it's not complicated enough for me.

Baaulp: Yeah... That's the other thing. It's like, there's not a-

Gir: You need a game to be complicated?

Wayne: Just wait 'til you get to the fucking raids!

Log: I'm a Path of Exile player. 

Gir: Oh, yeah.

Log: I just like, I like, do spreadsheets to figure things out.

Trog: I don't know, man.

Gir: How are you not into Eve, then?

Log: There's a cool kind of spreadsheet where you figure how to shoot fireballs as good as possible. And not...

Gir: A literal spreadsheet.

Log: Not trade stocks with some shithead in Eastern Dakotas, or something.

Gir: [laughs] East Dakota.

Trog: But, well, okay, so, I mean, I see what you're saying, and I'm s- I think like, the whole like-- Path of Exile definitely is a- going to be a more complex game when it comes to like, building characters, because I mean, I've seen that fucking skill tree. That thing is... That- that- the fucking skill tree in Path of Exile is unrivaled. Like, that thing is a gargantuan beast. But I will say, that I do think Destiny hits a pretty decent middle ground of like- okay, there is enough variation in the perks and weapons and stuff than you can like, and with all the exotic perks and stuff, you can really work towards like, a specialized build, but it's- also, most of the content is so easy that it's not necessary, I think is what it is.

Trog: If you're doing like the really late end game raids, or like really high-level nightfalls or whatever, like, you need to have specialized builds, but for most of the game that you have played, I think it's just not at that point yet. It's- it's made for like, people to just kind of be able to shoot through and not think too hard. So I think maybe if you stick with it a little longer and get to the point where builds actually start to matter, maybe you'll like it a little more? But I can see what you're saying about how like, it may be too simple.

Wayne: Yeah, I haven't-- like, I haven't done the really, really hard stuff, like the 950's or the raids, but Gir and I just tried like, the 920 last night, and that got my fucking adrenaline pumping. That shit is intense when that game gets hard.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: It's so much fun.

Gir: It gets wacky.

Wayne: It like, it was just, insane. I can't wait to play it. Fuck!

Trog: You should try getting the uhh, Exotic, what's it called-- the Outbreak Perfected or whatever, I think whenever me and Mira and Wayne--

Wayne: That, yeah.

Trog: -- did that quest, for reference, there is a very difficult quest in Destiny 2 that is like, two, uh, combat sections, at the beginning and the end, and a very difficult platforming section in the middle, and the whole thing is timed. You have 20 minutes to clear this thing, and it's just like, it's the right kind of stressful. It's hard, it's not too hard where it's frustrating, but it feels so good whenever you like, win.

Wayne: There's something-- I don't want to spoil it, really, there's something in that quest that is so scary, it's funny. 

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: It's like the most stressful thing I've seen in a video game, in a good way, in a long time! It makes me want to do the quest again.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: I mean I have to do the quest again, for the Heroic version.

Trog: It's true.

Wayne: We need to do that. You need to help me. The, umm...

Trog: Anyway. Tha-that's all. I only brought up Destiny because it's like, the only other thing I've been doing, so I literally don't have anything else to talk about.

Wayne: If you're listening to this podcast, and you like video games, Destiny 2. It's free now. Like, I think that's the- that's the one thing is that- their switch to free-to-play is some of the mo- the most drastic, like, paid game to free-to-play game I've ever seen. It's awesome. Go try it. It's free, you should. Um, but, uh, I think the last Destiny 2 topic I want to ask, for everyone who's played, what is your favourite Exotic that you've gotten so far?

Trog: Hmm...

Log: Prospector. I haven't really gotten than many, but the Prospector is called the Prospector, and it's just a machine gun grenade launcher. And whenever I fire it, even though I'm perpetually lower on the strength scale than everybody else that plays the game, that thing will kill everything in one stream of... concussive shots. So.

Wayne: Mira said he didn't like it as much. I thought it was interesting, that you love it and he hated it. The, uhh...

Log: Well, Mira is obviously, a supertaster, so.

Wayne: Yeah! 

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: [laughs] He can't taste the grenades as good as you.

Trog: Destiny supertaster.

Wayne: He tastes them too much.

Log: It applies to chicken and also grenade launchers.

Wayne: Trog, what's your favourite? As I assume, you've got the most of everybody.

Trog: You know, mine's kind of boring, but it's just uh, the, the, I don't even know what it's called. It's whatever the Exotic warlock helmet was, that you could get basically for free last week.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Oh, Nezarec's...

Trog: As of the time of this recording.

Wayne: [crosstalk] The Nezarec's thing? It's Nezarec's something. Yeah, and they like...

Trog: Yeah, something like... I don't, I can't- okay, here's the thing with Destiny, uh, nothing is easily named, everything has a dumb name that's impossible to remember, so I- I just, I stopped trying. I don't know what anything is called,  I just- I fucking press W and hold down my left click and I feel happy.

[Gir laughs]

Trog: I- I don't think. I just turn my brain off.

Wayne: But yeah, his helm- the helmet, like, it like, it reduces all your cool downs whenever you get a kill with anything that does void damage, and it's fucking- too strong. 

Trog: Yeah, any, any damage, it's just, it lets me spam grenades, which is a lot of fun in that game.

Wayne: I got like, I, I have that Exotic piece for my warlock, and then I have Exotic gloves that make it so like when I charge grenades, I don't take any damage, and like, they recharge- it gives me back my grenade energy. But I can't justify using it over that helmet because that helmet's too good. The, um- my favourite Exotic gun is either the Coldheart, which is like an ice laser beam, or the Worldline Zero, which is a sword that lets me teleport. Um, Baaulp and Gir, have you guys gotten any Exotics yet?

Baaulp: Uhh, just the helmet that... that...

Wayne: Did you not get the Riskrunner yet? I'm guessing Gir's answer would be the Riskrunner.

Gir: Yeah, Riskrunner. I like being able to shoot electricity in any kind of video game, so.

Wayne: Yeah, Riskrunner's good. Alright, let's move on.

Gir: Yes.

Trog: Yep.

Wayne: Um, so I have a li--

Gir: How about some quest-ion-es?

Trog: Yes.

Wayne: I've got a work story--

Trog: Oh.

Wayne: -- before we move on.

Gir: Oh, you've got a work story, yea?

Trog: Okay.

Wayne: It's- it's very small. It's very, it's- it's like, it's just something that I heard, so- last, the last time I told a work story it was about the Spob house kid. I don't this is going to top the Sbop house kid. But, the other day, I don't know what was going on. I was a cashier, I was tired as fuck. There was just a kid, just screaming, "I want HEADSHOTS!" over and over, and I don't know what the fuck they were talking about.

[Trog laughs]

Gir: Oh... You know what? You just reminded me of a work story, this was like 3 days ago, where there was this little girl, running back and forth, and for a solid 5 or 6 minutes was just repeating the phrase, "I'm Batman. I'm Batman. I'm Batma-" [laughs]

Wayne: Yo, she was, she was Batman! She...

Gir: Over and over and it was like, it was one of these weird things where it was, at first it was like, really annoying to me, cause I'm like trying to do my job and I just hear this kid shouting "I'm Batman" over and over, but the longer she went, she just kept it up without breaking a sweat and it just started cracking me the fuck up!

Wayne: She's like Baaulp, she's committed to the bit! She n- she didn't want to break it.

Gir: It was just hilarious to me that for a full 5 minutes this kid just kept saying "I'm Batman".

Wayne: She was having a blast, and she was Batman.

Gir: She was Batman, dude.

Wayne: Today, I um- accused, I like subtly accused someone of stealing and I was completely wrong and I felt really embarrassed. The, somebody w- like, somebody walked into the store, they didn't buy anything, and they walked out, and he had like, something in his hand that looked like a dog toy. And I was like, I wasn't even gonna give him that much shit for it, but I just kinda like, as he walked out I just said like, "Is that a dog toy?" And he was like, "No, it's an umbrella." And then I looked closer and it was clearly an umbrella. And I'm just like, "Fuck," and I turned around and wanted to die. I felt so bad that I did that! 

[Trog laughs] 

Gir: Now see, that's, I- because of my experience with an incredibly high amount of shoplifters, I know how to handle that situation much better than you. What you do is-- 

Wayne: Okay, asshole! 

Gir: Yeah, yeah, yeah- 

Wayne: [crosstalk] I don't wanna hear it! Don't tell me! 

Gir: If you see somebody... 

Wayne: But I- in the, there's something I wanna say, but I won't say it, because it would get me fired. 

Gir: Probably. But if you see somebody who's shoplifting, if you know they're shoplifting, do some- try to do something about it. Don't get physical about it, but do it. 

Wayne: I, I mean I know- 

Gir: If you think they're shoplifting, don't do jack shit! 

Wayne: Yeah. I mean, it was the kind of thing where if he walked out with a toy, like-- 

Gir: It's like shit, I got- I got a free dog toy. 

Wayne: [crosstalk] [stammers] If I noticed it, if I noticed it at the last sect- at the last moment, like, it's- just go. I'm not gonna do it, like. 

Gir: Yeah. 

Wayne: You- you-- it's not your job to stop people from stealing. Uh, but-- 

Gir: My favourite thing, personally, is if I see somebody, and they walk in the store, and the first thing I notice is they've got a backpack on, halfway open, totally empty-- 

Wayne: Oh, yeah. 

Gir: -- they're wiping the fucking coke off their nose, and they're looking around like a fuckin' crazed maniac? My favourite fucking thing to do, is wait until they walk over to the alcohol, which is always the first fucking thing they do, and then call for security - because we don't have security, but they hear that and they fucking run away! 

Wayne: Fuck. The fucking, I guess in Vegas it's a lot worse for that kind of like... 

Gir: Oh, it's fucking terrible, dude. 

Wayne: I think the only- in terms of like, weird shit happenin' in my store, the only thing that was weird that was happen, I told you about it on, I think I talked about it on the podcast. It was like, those two people, like, shooting up or something in the bathroom and then playing in the cat litter. [mutters] I've told that story before. 

Gir: Oh, yeah. We- we, we don't have a handicap bathroom. It had to get locked up, 'cause people only went in there to shower or take heroin. 

Wayne: This isn't a fun topic, this... 

Log: You ever seen a book signing in a grocery store? 

Wayne and Trog: No...? 

Gir: I did see a homeless man throw a brick into the store. 

Log: Well that has-- 

Trog: That's-- 

Log: That's basically the inverse, pretty much. 

Trog: That's completely unrelated! 

[Gir laughs] 

Wayne: Homeless Man Throws Brick, I love that video. 

Log: But um, yeah, I saw a book signing at a Kroger a couple- like a month ago. 

Gir: That's so weird. 

Log: That, that- 

Baaulp: Why? 

Log: I didn't think that Kroger would do something like that, but there was a woman there, just in front of the aisles, with a book, and it was called like, Doggie Do's, or something. 

[Wayne and Baaulp laugh] 

Log: And I- I immediately walked- I immediately walked past it 'cause it felt like, it felt like, like a bad aura. There was like a bad vibe. 

Trog: Evil presence! 

Wayne: You didn't want a-- you didn't want a signed copy of Doggie Do's? Dude... 

Log: Kroger book- Kroger book signing, I avoid that. 

Wayne: Little did you know, little did you fucking know, a signed copy of that book would have been worth ten thousand dollars. 

Log: Well. I don't think anybody else knew that, either, 'cause it was a... 

[Wayne and Trog laugh] 

Gir: Not poppin'? 

Log: It was uh, not a line. Not a line. 

Gir: Oh, man... 

Wayne: What kind of questions do we got, tonight?

Trog: Uh, the kind that end in question marks. And the kind that are...

Wayne: I hate that kind.

Trog: ...confusing and don't really have answers, mostly.

Wayne: I hate that type! Yeah--

Trog: As they normally are.

Wayne: I bet there's a lot of questions along the lines of "does wyne like flies", which is the classic of questions. 

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Okay, so, what's our first question?

Trog: How about we answer this one from Mike, who asks: Would you rather have four arms, or four legs?

Wayne: Four arms! Who the f--

Log and Trog: Four arms!

Baaulp: Yeah! [laughs]

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, like--

Wayne: You can't do anything! Four legs- four legs on a human wouldn't make- it wouldn't do anything!

Trog: What if it turns you into like, like, a centaur, but instead of a horse body, it's just a longer human body?

Gir: Eulgh! Next question!

Log: What a sad existence. 

Wayne: It wouldn't do anything. You wouldn't move faster. You'd move slower, with four legs, I think.

Log: Four arms would be so cool.

Wayne: Four legs, with like, human features, and a human brain, you'd move slow.

Trog: Hey, you can't gallop with two legs. Gotta have four.

Wayne: Yes you can. 

Trog: Nope. Gotta have four.

Wayne: Yes you can gallop with two legs.

Trog: How do you gallop with two legs?

Wayne: You f- you like, skip!

Gir: You skip. That is what skipping is.

Trog: That's a skip, that's not a gallop! You just described it as a skip.

Wayne: [mimics the sound of horses running] There is something like, you- I would do it in gym class when I was a kid. You galloped. It was like, running sideways... I don't- I don't know how to describe it. You like, you fucking jumped, and like, sort of skipped, but not really?

Gir: It was like, the lemur walk.

Wayne: Yeah, you walk like a lemur, that's galloping.

Trog: That's not a gallop!

Wayne: I don't know.

Baaulp: There are monkeys that have like, l- like, feet, that are basically just long hands. I'm- I think I'd be okay with four hands and no feet.

Gir: Human feet are still just long hands.

Trog: They're just fucked up with no thumbs.

Baaulp: Yeah, they're just- they're just, yeah, they're just messed up and not opposable.

Gir: I've been saying that for years!

Log: I spent a long time thinking about the abilities of four arms, and my determination is that if you have four arms, you can do an overhead pound and punch somebody in the gut at the same time, so they couldn't do anything about it.

Wayne: Oh- is that- you, you have that one character that you draw with the four eyes and the four arms, is that how you came to this realization?

Log: Yeah. I have to-

[Wayne laughs]

Log: I have to like, determine the benefits of four arms, before I put them on.

Gir: I came to that realization watching Ben 10, seeing the character Four Arms.

Wayne: I mean- have, have you heard of Goro, motherfuckers?

Gir: Who?

Wayne: Goro kicks ass. Goro is...

Trog: I mean, I don't know, I think Ben 10 did it first.

Gir: I think Ben 10 did it first.

Log: Yeah, yeah.

Wayne: [laughs] I hate you. I think Danny Phantom did it first.

Gir: Danny Phantom had only two arms, bitch.

Wayne: That's not what I mean at all, you dumbass!

Trog: [crosstalk] It is true, Danny Phantom did only have two arms.

[Gir and Wayne laugh]

Trog: Facts!

Baaulp: Oh shit, he's trying to trick us into talking about Danny Phantom again! Snip this in the bud.

Log: Mickey Mouse probably did it first. I bet there was a Mickey Mouse cartoon with a centipede with four arms.

Wayne: Uh, Where Do We Begin, fact of the day, Danny Phantom does not have four arms. He has two.

Trog: I'm so fucking glad.

Trog: I don't really know how to answer this, but I do like the question, who... this is, ItsAGundamu asks, "Most OP character in a video game?" And I guess that's just asking us what is the most broken character in a video game we've played, I'm gonna- assume?

Gir: Really subjective.

Wayne: [crosstalk] That could be any game.

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: Umm...

Trog: Yeah- think about, think about, what is like, what is the most broken, overpowered character or ability, or whatever, like, in a game, that you'd played.

Gir: I couldn't tell you.

Trog: Really?

Log: Hmm... What could it be?

Gir: First thing that would come to mind is Loader, in fuckin', Risk of Rain 2.

Wayne: 6.82 Sniper and Troll Warlord. I won't explain that.

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Trog: I was gonna bring up Dota as well.

Wayne: I won't explain that. 6.82 Sniper, Troll Warlord.

Log: [laughs, imitating the Troll Warlord]

Wayne: [laughs] Fucking- PTSD!

Log: That was so much fucking fun!

Trog: I was going to bring up Dota as well but I actually wasn't--

Wayne: That's what made me quit Dota!

Trog: -- going to bring up the sniper troll patch-

Log: We quit after 6.82.

Wayne: That was like, the patch that I left.

Baaulp: The first three days of Monkey King coming out was pretty scary.

Trog: There's a lot of fun, broken stuff in MOBAs that I can think of.

Baaulp: Because no-one knew how to lane against Monkey King yet, and so he would hit you twice, and then kill you.

Trog: There was, Sniper Troll patch, but the one that comes to my mind is Oracle on release because I would- we would do, me and Log, Oracle Slark, and it would just, we won every time we did that. For the people who don't know, which is probably 99% of people that are listening to this, in Dota 2, there is a character that, on release, could make people invisible. And then there's another character that gets really, really strong when they're invisible. And you'd just put them on the same team.

Log: And this kind of invisibility would not get broken by anything.

Trog: Yes. They would get permanently invisible for like, 5 seconds, or whatever.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah, so you could attack--

Trog: It was great. I loved it.

Wayne: Man, I'm trying to think of non-Dota so listeners can actually relate, and not-- [laughs]

Trog: Yeah. I'm trying to think too.

Wayne: -- be fucking confused.

Baaulp: Well, here's the thing, they- we bring up Dota because it's, it's in competitive games that- where that shit is the sc- [unintelligible] - crazy.

Wayne: [crosstalk] I'm trying to think of like, both.

Trog: I'm trying to think of a single-player game.

Log: Yeah, I'm trying to think of stuff, but I can only think of like, pathetically bad stuff.

Baaulp: Yeah. [laughs]

Trog: [laughs] Uh, in Dark Souls 2, I remember when Dark Souls 2 first came out and you could power stance clubs, and that was like, the best thing to beat the game with, I remember doing speedruns and it was great because it's just a dude in a loincloth with two clubs, just going ham on everything.

Wayne: Man, that was good. 

Gir: I do remember people bitching about the Dark Sword in Dark Souls 3.

Log: Oh, I, I thought of something, 'cause this was something I talked to you guys recently about. Uh, I've played Path of Exile since its closed beta, so I remember a lot of the broken stuff that has existed in that game. I wouldn't ever call it the most OP stuff ever, in any game, but a lot of it was just like, really- just abusing abstract mechanics, which is really good. Uh, probably one of the best ones is something that everybody called 'Worm Blaster', because in Path of Exile, it's like Diablo, there's a lot of unique items that have special effects. Uh, there was a sp- unique item called Jar of Worms which was just a- basically a potion, and whenever you used the potion, worms would come out of you, and they would just be on the field. And they'd be enemies, and you could hit- kill them. 

Log: The thing with that, is you spawned 8 worms that die in one hit, you have like, 15 different things that can activate when you can kill an enemy, and you just- you'd defeat bosses by defeating worms and causing like, explosion, cataclysmic explosions by killing worms over and over again.

Trog: That sounds sick.

Log: The best part about that, is like, they tried to fix that, over and over, and people are- people- it's like a fucking, it's like a fucking disease, like. People- people survive under the harsh conditions and they find a new way to kill everything in the game by spawning worms on the floor.

Trog: [laughs] That's great.

Log: Recently it's gotten so bad that like- well, there's like actually like a set of stuff  they had to change because it would crash their servers.

Wayne: My last input to this: uh, Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 2 Kid Gohan was broken.

Trog: Heh, yeah.

Wayne: He just- it just, all it w- it was broken, where you'd just, pick Kid Gohan for any story mission, because you could pick like, any character you wanted, generally, and you would just spam Masenko and you- like, once you got enough energy to do it, you'd shoot the Masenko beam, it would return enough energy to do it again, and the NPCs would not block half the time. So you'd just win. You'd just spam it.

Log: My counter argument: uh, Dragon Ball Z Budokai Tenkaichi 1, any character in the game, because there was a universal infinite combo that was so easy that--

[Wayne laughs]

Log: -- my 8 year old self discovered it on my own.

Wayne: Ah, that's good.

Gir: What was the one where Yamcha was the strongest one?

Wayne: The first game, Budokai Tenkaichi?

Gir: [crosstalk] Was it the first game?

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: I think Budokai... yeah.

Wayne: He was the last character you unlocked and Wolf Fang Fist was just really good and it like,--

Gir: That's funny.

Wayne: -- it did more damage than anything else and was really fast.

Log: You could do whatever you wanted in Budokai Tenkaichi 1. There was a story mission where it's like, you're Hercule versus Majin Buu and you just had to survive, and I just killed him instead.

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Trog: Nice. That's always fun.

Wayne: That's great.

Trog: I love shit like that in games, where it like, expects you to lose, but you can win anyway.

Wayne: If you're good enough. Like yeah, fuckin', the cl- the classic of classic, is Kingdom Hearts 1 when you fight Leon.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: That was like, the first one. I remember doing that once as a kid and fuckin' freaking out.

Trog: Yeah, you get like a potion, or something. 

Wayne: [crosstalk] I thought I was so good.

Trog: Yeah, you barely get anything--

Wayne: Yeah, you get like a potion--! Ah, man.

Baaulp: Uh, our friend Slumbermancer asks, "If you could get any animal as a guest on the podcast, and they have the power to speak and understand English, what animal would it be?" 

Trog: Hmm.

Wayne: Probably my bird.

Gir: Maybe my-- I was about to say the same thing.

Wayne: We get Tori and Jazz on the podcast. 

Baaulp: Oh, man!

Gir: I could ask her why she's such a bitch.

Wayne: I mean, they'd probably, if it was- here's the thing, whenever you do, whenever you do stuff like that, and you talk about the theorhetical, 'oh, what if this animal could talk', they're not gonna talk any smarter than they would--

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah.

Wayne: Like, if we brought my bird on the podcast, it would just be- it would just be like, "Hey! Hey dad! Hey! I'm in your shirt." And that would be it. Like, the- like, the-- 'cause like, that's what he does! Like, and then if I leave the bird, he screams my name.

Trog: I mean, look, you gotta suspend your disbelief a little bit, alright? 

Gir: No, mine would literally just be repeating the phrase, "Food? Food for me? Food?"

Wayne: "You got- you got a almond? You got a papaya?"

Baaulp: Are you sure they wouldn't talk in a gruff, New Yorker accent? [imitating a New York accent] "Eyy, give me some, uh, a piece of your bagel!"

Gir: [imitating the same accent] "Gimme some fuckin' food here, huh!"

Wayne: He doesn't want my bagel. Are you fucking- stupid?

Trog: No, because they're tiny, so it would be really high pitched and squeaky.

Baaulp: [in a high pitched New Yorker accent] "Ey, not so many onions in the sauce, okay!"

Trog: Yeah, exactly like that! Whatever that was.

[Wayne laughs]

Gir: Heh, okay.

Log: I'd like to invite a clutch of sewer rats onto the podcast.

Gir: Why sewer rats?

Trog: You and your rats.

Log: To see what they have to say. I mean, there's gonna be like, at least 15 of them, so they'd just start talking on their own, we [unintelligible].

Wayne: We love- we love- we love Holly, but I'm gonna- I'm gonna shit on this question, I don't think any animal would be a good podcast guest.

Trog: Mmm, what about the- what about Koko? The gorilla?

Wayne: Okay.

Gir: The gorilla?

Wayne: Okay. Okay. I'm- I will retire as podcast host because that is true.

Gir: Uh, Koko only communicates with sign language?

Trog: The- the question said they can talk!

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: They can talk, Gir.

Gir: She can talk! Through sign language!

Wayne: Okay, okay, so either Koko, the gorilla that speaks, or uh...

Trog: Which is her full name. Koko, the Gorilla that Speaks.

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: I have a friend- I have a friend, who I have- have on steam, whose name has been 'Koko, the Gorilla who Speaks' for like, years and years.

Trog: [laughs] That's such a good steam name.

Wayne: The- it's very good! [laughs] They might be listening to this. Um, the-

Log: How about the chimp who presses numbers really fast?

Trog: Ooo, that'd be good. I wanna learn how that chimp learned how to do that.

Wayne: He would just say 'one two three four five' over and over. It wouldn't be any fun. Um, the, or a- honestly, like, just a--

Trog: Don't speak for the monkey who presses numbers! You don't know what he'd say!

Gir: Sure.

Wayne: He would-- or a pigeon. I think a pigeon from a city would be pretty funny. He'd have a lot of stories to tell.

Trog: You would rather have a pigeon than the monkey that presses numbers in order really fast?

Gir: All that- all that monkey knows is numbers and peanuts!

Wayne: That interview- that interview might be sad.

Trog: Why? [laughs] He's so good at numbers, he'd have- he'd have so much to teach us!

Wayne: He's like, "I hate pressing numbers, but I love peanuts. So I have to do it." 

Trog: "It's the only way!"

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: "I need the peanuts!"

Gir: Yeah, let's invite him on here to talk about his job!

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Gir: "I don't like it, it pays peanuts."

[Baaulp wheezes]

Wayne: That one got Baaulp.

Baaulp: "I fuckin'- I fuckin' hate this job! But I gotta do it!"

Log: Oh, wait, we're forgetting StrayCatJ, who already talks.

[Gir yells]

Wayne: Get on this fucking podcast, StrayCatJ. 

Trog: [unintelligible]

Wayne: We'll let you swear. We'll let you swear like your landlady doesn't.

Wayne: HotGrits asks, "How would you make fighting games, souls-like and other 'gamer games', approachable for senior citizens?"

Trog: Make the buttons bigger.

Gir: Big text.

Wayne: Make the buttons bigger... 

Trog: Bigger text.

Wayne: Make Ryu- make Ryu call out suggestions for the moves they need to do.

Gir: Tell 'em their grandchild will call them if they beat the game.

Wayne: 'I think you should do Hadouken! Quarter-circle-forward punch!'

Baaulp: They- they turn- they turn their head ninety degrees and look straight at you and say that!

Log: I think the answer is that if they grew up playing those games, they'll be fine anyway, no matter what, and...

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah.

Wayne: The question is for introducing senior citizens to these games.

Log: If they reach the age of 60 without ever playing one of those games they will refuse to play them outright.

Wayne: But that's not the question! That's saying, okay so, my grandpa, my grandpa walked in, my- my dead grandpa who I've never met, walked into my room and he said, "Dark Souls? What- what is that? That looks great. Let me take a crack at that."

Wayne: Like, how do we get him- how do we- how do we mod the game to get him better at it?

Log: Uh, you... you, you don't.

Gir: Mod the game to go at three times slower speed.

Wayne: Estus flasks replaced with Werther's Originals...

[Gir laughs]

Baaulp: You're gonna make it approachable.

Wayne: Yeah, that- that's the question! Jesus Christ! [laughs]

Baaulp: No, I mean, you're- you're- literally, make it more approachable, make it familiar to them. Like!

Trog and Wayne: Yeah!

Wayne: 'Cause like--

Baaulp: Replace things with things they know!

Wayne: He's a fuckin'- he's a fuckin' World World 2 Veteran. He's gonna- he's like, "What the fuck is an Estus flask?"

Gir: [crosstalk] World World 2.

Wayne: Yes, that's a reference. Get fuckin'- follow my blog and you'd get it too. The-

Gir: Aw, I don't follow you on Twitter.

Wayne: You follow CommentTube, bitch. So, yeah, Estus flask would be Werther's originals, uh, hmm, that's the only joke I can think of.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Good job.

Log: I'd probably just put the games on Cyberpunk Mindjack so the old people forget that they even exist outside of the game.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, yeah!

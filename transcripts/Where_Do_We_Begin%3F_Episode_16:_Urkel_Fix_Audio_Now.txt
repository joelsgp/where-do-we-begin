Wayne: Okay, now introduce Gir.

Gir: I go—I usually go last, but… I’m Gir.

Trog, laughing: We don’t even remember the order.

[Baaulp laughs]

Baaulp: I’m Baaulp.

Log: And they call me Log, the Devil’s Mystery.

Wayne: The—the final member.

Baaulp: The Devil’s Mystery…

Wayne: Welcome, it’s another-it’s another fantastic episode of the Where Do We Begin podcast, and uh, tonight we have all kinds of topics and merriment and mirth to share with you. Uh, it has been three months since our last episode, since our last episode was both recorded and released. It’s been a long time, we got a lot to talk about!

Log: It’s been like a little summer time capsule.

Wayne: The review it is-it is—this is the episode of the summer. We’re gonna talk all about the—

Trog: Mhmm.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: —We’re gonna talk about the sun, we’re gonna talk all
about the beach that we didn’t go to.

Trog: It is literally the episode of the summer. There will not be another episode of this podcast recorded in summer of 2020.

Wayne: [Laughs] I mean, summer-summer goes—summer goes into September. So like, if we do an early September episode…

Trog: Oh, maybe. Yeah.

Wayne: Y’know, that’s fucked up. Summer should end when September starts. I think-I think it’s dumb that seasons go into months that are not attributed to those seasons.

Baaulp: [Crosstalk] What? What? What are you—what?

Wayne: September is the fall to me. Like, as soon as it’s early September, that’s fall.

Log: August is fall, practically. Like—

Wayne: Really? No, August is summer! August is the hottest month.

Log: June and July are summer months and that’s all I know.

Gir: Yeah, you’re out of your mind.

Log: May, June, July, that sounds like summer. August—August sounds like tree leaves turning orange and red.

Wayne: That’s wild, what? Wha—wha—

Gir: You’re wrong. I mean, you’re wrong.

Trog: That’s literally incorrect.

Log: It sounds that—like that don’t-don’t it?

Wayne: [Crosstalk] It’s not! No! That’s September!

Gir: [Crosstalk] No, it doesn’t sound like that!

Log: Think about-think about the words and how they feel.

Wayne: That’s when—that’s when—that’s when the -bers start. When the-when the -bers start, that’s when the leaves come down. That’s-that’s September, October, November.

Gir: The word August does not convey win—uh, fall to me.

Log: Indiana was like that in August. I’m… [unintelligible]

Wayne: August sounds like hot. August sounds like hot and heat and ice cream and—and waves.

Gir: It sounds like, “Ah gosh, it’s hot outside.”

Log: August sounds cold—the word August sounds colder than many other months.

Trog: You know, I kind of agree.

Wayne: The fuck are you talk—you’re crazy!

Trog: As somebody who lives in Texas where it’s like a hundred degrees every fucking day during this month, I would be down with summer just kind of being the beginning of June and that’s it. And it just goes away.

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: It’s just really hot, it’s like nineties for a couple weeks then it goes back down.

Gir: Oh, cry me a fucking river, I’m sitting over here with my fuckin’ hundred and thirteen degrees when I step outside. Choke to death as soon as I step out the door.

Wayne: Just bring a—just bring a wet towel and douse yourself.

Baaulp: You can’t blame us for all the sin making Vegas hot.

[Wayne makes a smug sound of approval]

Trog: Yeah, get further away from Hell.

Gir: There’s so much less sin here than there usually is, though.

Baaulp: Yeah. Yeah, it’s hot because you’re closer to Hell ‘cause all the sin, and the debauchery.

Wayne: Gir, I promise you that once you start being a good boy and you stop all that sinnin’, it’ll cool down.

Gir: [Crosstalk] I am good! I’ve never done anything
wrong.

Wayne: The Devil—the Devil’s gaze—the Devil’s gaze will go elsewhere and it’ll cool down.

Log: The magnifying glass will turn away.

[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

Wayne: [Laughs harder] Imagine God holding an—Imagine God holding a magnifying glass up to you specifically. Like he’s just trying to burn you.

[Trog laughs]

Baaulp: Like he’s burning an ant?

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: Just you, specifically.

Gir: That reminds me of, uh—

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Die MasterGir.

Gir: Of uh, I don’t know why, but out of nowhere I was like, “I’m going to look up who’s been struck by lightning more than anyone else on Earth.” And there’s the—there’s the guy who was like a park ranger who got struck by lightning seven times.

[Trog laughs]

Trog: And lived?

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: That guy could do a fuckin’ Electric Wind God Fist.

Log, in a deep voice: You need to let those animals die.

Gir: After the third time, he started getting so paranoid that as soon as he heard thunder he would just like, hide.

Trog: Then how did he—Well he didn’t follow his own advice; how did he get struck four more times?

Wayne: Is there science to it? Like, is the fact that he was struck and survived, did it like electrocharge his body in a way that like, attracted more lightning?

Gir: There was science to it in that he was a park ranger so he was always outside, and he was a park ranger in Virginia that has like, a shitload of thunderstorms.

Wayne: I guess.

Baaulp: Damn, I would look for a new job after, y’know… The second lightning strike [laughs].

Gir: Yeah, this story doesn’t end happily, unfortunately.

Wayne: There has never been a man that deserves superpowers more than that guy. Like, come on, he needs some abilities. Give—Give the man some abilities!

Gir: It seemed like by the seventh time he got struck he just kind of didn’t care anymore. He just—he told the story like, he got struck by lightning and he turned to go to his car to fetch the water that puts out his hair that caught on fire yet again, and uh, he got struck while he was fishing and noticed a bear was trying to steal his fish on his way back to his car, and he ran back and hit the bear with a—with a branch.

Wayne: Holy shit. This dude’s kind of badass.

Gir: Yeah, he was.

Trog: You think maybe he had some kind of weird, like, genetic predisposition like—

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

Trog: Was he like—

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Some sort of like, natural electromagnetism that was attracting bolts of lightning.

Trog: Yeah, he just was a living magnet? Like—

Log: Yeah, your blood is just iron, I don’t know how it even moves through your body!

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Not even a liquid.

Log: That was like a Family Matters episode. You guys ever watch Family Matters?

Baaulp: What? No?

Trog: Probably like, one episode ever.

Log: There’s an episode where like, I guess they have like multiple plot points, but one of them was that Steve Urkel kept getting struck by lightning, and he figured out it was because there was too much iron in his blood, so he ran all of his blood through a dialysis machine that he built himself.

Trog: That sounds like… a horrific—like a—like body horror sitcom.

Gir: Sounds like a very easy way to get yourself killed.

Wayne: Family Matters was fucking crazy. Have you seen Dark Urkel Tribute?

Trog: That’s—that’s the only thing I’ve seen of Family Matters, that’s my entire frame of reference. 

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: I never watched most Family Matters but, I did know that it devolved into the Steve Urkel show.

Wayne: Out of all those sitcoms—it originally wasn’t the Steve Urkel show, huh? It was more about Carl Winslow and his family.

Gir: No, he was just like the neighbor or something.

Wayne: Yeah.

Baaulp: Steve Urkel wasn’t even in the family of Family Matters. He was their neighbor [laughs].

Trog: Yeah, it was the kind of thing where it was just a breakaway hit and the exec. saw it and was like, “We gotta make fucking Urkel plush dolls and t-shirts and hats and put him in every episode, they can’t get enough.” The nineties had Urkel fever.

Wayne: Out of all those sitcoms—out of all those—out of all
the sitcoms from that era, Family Matters had the best theme song by far. By far.

Trog: And then—and then Urkel, he became Sonic.

Log: When you get down to it, though, it’s like they kind of had to do it. They fucked up because they didn’t have like, the best character in the family, and so they just had to—they had to do it. It’s not like—it’s not like Fresh Prince y’know, where like, every character was good, like Family Matters I feel like it was Carl Winslow and Steve Urkel. And like, that was the show.

Wayne: Yeah.

Baaulp: See, if that’s the thing, they should have just made a spin off. Like fuck it, end the original show, have a spin off. Have a spin off—have a spin off where it’s five Urkels, have a spin off where Urkel clones himself four times, and it’s a house of Urkels.

[Trog and Wayne laugh]

Wayne: Hey everybody, we’re back! I hope you enjoyed one thirty seconds of Family Matters talk, because now we’ve had to restart the episode uh, we had a little problem, uh, my recording software crashed. Uh, and we—we then talked for about twenty minutes, so we lost a big chunk of discussion. We talked about Rogue of Legacy 2, we talked about Fall Guys, we talked about Steve Urkel, it was really funny, um, and really insightful.

Trog: You’ll never hear it!

Wayne: You’ll never hear it.

Baaulp: Just imagine it!

Log: I was dominating the conversation, right? I swerved it into Family Matters and started talking about One Piece. Like, it was—it was, uh—

Wayne: Hey. Give me some credit. I brought up Igaram.

Log: It was ten minutes of Logmore precedence, and we lost it ‘cause Wayne was being a little snake.

Wayne: I didn’t know what happened!

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: It didn’t—In the program—Okay, so, to be fair, to be fair and genuine, I have a strange recording setup where I use OBS to record my audio because I already have like, a very good noise gate setup in there, and normally if OBS crashes it fuckin’ tells me! This time, nope, it just wasn’t open. Just wasn’t open. I just looked down and I saw that the—the little button on my start bar didn’t have a light under it.

Gir, mockingly: There is no more little button!

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Buh-bye.

Baaulp: Alright. Listen, listen, listen. Don’t ask any questions, I need—I need fanart of Nico Robin from One Piece going, [in a Steve Urkel voice] “Did I do that?”

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: No context given. You just have to trust us it was really funny at the time.

Gir: You’ll figure it out.

Wayne: One day you'll realize the true nature of this request.

Log: Yeah, need a Urkle and One Piece kwosh... Urkle and one piece crossover.

Wayne: It has been quite some time, since we've recorded a podcast, and a lot of stuff has happened! We've been playing a lot of games, the, uh... we've done all kinds of streams, all kinds of great content for you guys, but podcast has been getting neglected, because we've been working so hard on other stuff. We put together a very fun production a few weeks ago called AI-adventure Call, spearheaded by our-- by our fantastic dog producer, Trog.

Trog: Woo.

Wayne: Thank you Trog, you did an amazing job.

Trog: Thank you, yeah.

Wayne: I just wanna talk about it a little bit.

Trog: Nah, I'm into it.

Wayne: Yeah, Trog- Trog had the original idea to do something along the lines of Adventure Call from Limmy Show. And, uh, I, and he was talking about setting something up and doing it on his stream, but I was like, I tugged on his shirt and I was like, "Yo, let me, let me buy a costume, let me play a character." And then we turned it into a much larger production, and it became- it was fuckin' huge! It was awesome.

Trog: In case you don't know what Adventure Call from Limmy Show is, it is a series of skits in which Limmy, who is a comedian, who has a comedy sketch show, or had a comedy sketch show, dresses up like a fantasy man, and hosts a call-in program where you must best a dungeon.

Wayne: Is he like a satyr?

Log: He's like a bard.

Wayne: [Laughs] He kinda looks like a satyr.

Log: He's more of a, just a general bard, or a minstrel-

Trog: Yeah, he's kinda just like a dude, but, um so that was the idea. I was, so like I had, like, we all love those sketches. Those sketches are great, and um, we also happen to all really enjoy AI dungeon as a concept. And I feel like it was just-

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Oh, yeah. It's Trog's game of the year!

Trog: It was pretty obvious to me to just be like, “Why don’t we just do that, like, why don’t we just combine these two funny ideas into one.” And so, the idea was born. And then Wayne bought a bunch of dumb bullshit on Amazon that like, honestly, whenever you put that costume on, you transformed into a different human. It was like, scary.

Wayne: [Laughs] It was awesome!

Trog: You didn’t look like you.

Wayne: It was my—it’s my favorite costume that I’ve put together yet.

Trog: [Crosstalk] I think it’s my favorite as well.

Wayne: I’ve done a ton of different costumes—I’ve done a ton of different costumes for like, little bits here and there, we—there’s a caveman—like, my fuckin’, my closet—honestly, I love stocking up on dumb costume items because my closet is just full of shit. I could put together like, so many costumes by combining them, there’s a caveman, there’s the—uh, there’s not really a vague term to describe what the Fushigi Freak is.

Trog, laughing: Morpheus.

Wayne: Uh, but, there’s that. There’s the Morpheus-like—Morpheus-like individual. There’s, uh, I have—I have face paint for like a robot costume. I’ve got a morph suit, I got—I got a knight’s outfit, there’s a costume in there I can’t tell you about yet. The, like, all kinds of shit. The—And, but this costume, I think the number one thing was like when we had this idea, I think the first thing, like when we were in the voicecall that we all marveled at was like, I think someone said, “Wayne, you should buy chainmail,” and then it began.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: The—the chainmail was the—it was the centerpiece. It was the—it was like the main clip that held it all together. Uh, and then Scorpy found the beautiful five dollar goatee.

[Baaulp laughs]

Gir: That—that thing I think was the real centerpiece if—in my opinion.

Wayne: It worked with the chainmail. Those—those two together is what transformed me.

Gir: The gems on the crown.

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: So to speak.

Log: Yeah, it was really good. Y’know, I—I forget, I don’t really think about how easily accessible Limmy is, now. I wonder if that—I wonder if these clips have like, gotten to him in any way.

Gir: I highly, highly, highly doubt it.

Trog: I will one hundred percent admit that it was like, that that—that was not an original idea, that was two ideas that already existed that I thought it would be fun to combine. I—I one hundred percent give the original credit for that, that inspiration, to those Limmy show sketches.

Baaulp: I talked to other streamers, and like, other people who like, are—we’ve set a—I think we’ve set a trend! I’ve seen people—more and more people stream AI Dungeon, and—and like, but they say like—

Wayne: We’re not the only ones. There’s bigger streamers than us that do it.

Baaulp: Well—

Wayne: But nobody’s doing anything like AI-dventure Call. That was—

Trog: That’s true. That’s unique. We’re raising the bar.

Baaulp: I’ve talked to people and they’re like, “Yeah, at the end of the day, it is a text adventure. I wonder if we could make it more exciting.” Hey, we figured it out [laughs].

Wayne: And we have other ideas that we haven’t even done yet! The, like, the-the-the-the thing with—the thing with like, the reason that while the idea is a hundred percent Limmy’s, the reason why it’s like, we, like, our spin on it is like, valid and justified, is like, with the Adventure Call on Limmy’s show, those were like, skits. We put on, like, an actual like, essentially what would have been an episode of a TV show. Like, it was like a three hour long thing rather than just like a showcase of like their really funny gags. And I don’t mean to downplay Adventure Call, that shit’s still hilarious.

Trog: No, I mean it’s-it’s completely different, right? Because the Adventure Call skits, they are skits, they are written, it is a script. The AI Dungeon thing, by the nature of AI Dungeon, it cannot be prewritten, like, we-we basically went into it with like, okay, we’re like—all of the contestants are gonna kind of have like, their own mini-bit that they’re doing, but there’s—it’s all improv, like everything we do, basically. It’s all just improv in the end, so. It’s different enough that it’s not like we’re ripping it off. It’s an homage.

Baaulp: The only gag that wasn’t improv was the tuna.

Gir: Oh, yeah, the tuna.

Trog, laughing: The tuna? Oh—oh, the grand prize.

Wayne: Like, we were joking about, like, I think it was supposed to be beans at first, like, ‘cause—‘cause we’d been watching like Legends of the Hidden Temple, and Legend—

Trog: Oh, yeah.

Log: Tuna was the prize in Legends of the Hidden Temple.

Wayne: It was! Legends—Legends of the Hidden Temple was like, we’d-we’d been—we-we were watching it at one point occasionally, and that show, if you lose on that show, which most kids do, your prize is so fuckin’ sad. They give you like, a book with a holographic cover, or like, a can of tuna. Genuinely! A can of fucking tuna.

Gir: Here’s a backpack! Enjoy!

Wayne: A backpack! Shoes that might—they have a plastic strap on them instead of Velcro! Like, it’s just—

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Or you—[Laughs] Did anyone else hear that?

Baaulp: Wha—what? What was it?

Gir: [Laughs] Yes, I was like, who’s strangling a cat!?

Wayne: Baaulp you were like, holding in a laugh, and it—we just heard like [high pitch inhale sounds].

[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

Baaulp: My laughs can get pretty fucked up.

Wayne: You charge ‘em up.

Baaulp: Wha—what was the—what was the slogan for the shoes? Like, wasn’t the slogan like, “Get Ready to Devolve,” or some shit?

Wayne: Yeah it was like, “Time to Mutate,” it was, “Time to Mutate!”

[Log and Trog laugh]

Baaulp: Yes! It was, “Time to Mutate!” What the fuck?

Gir: That’s a terrible slogan.

Log: Typical nineties.

Wayne: It was literally just—it was just a sneaker for kids with like, a zip tie on it.

Baaulp, laughing: Yeah.

Wayne: Like, I’m pretty sure it was just a zip tie. And then the—so, the slogan was “Time to Mutate,” and the video, the commercial was like, it was like a stop motion of a kid standing in like a walking position and just moving with the stop motion, and—

Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah, and they were like in an empty warehouse.

Wayne: — I think-I think there was like, Scorpy—Scorpy said like, “Yeah, if I saw them when I was a kid, I would think that like, that was a shoe that—that made it so you didn’t have to pick up your feet. Like, you’d just do that.”

[Baaulp laughs]

Gir: I thought it was those like, rollerblade shoes at first.

Wayne: Yeah, like Heelys!

Gir: Yeah, exactly.

Trog: Yeah. I would say the AI Adventure Call thing, we were—we were y’know, Limmy’s show, and just like call-in shows in general—

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Yeah, public access.

Trog: —and then also we’ve just been watching like, a handful of nineties gameshows at the time, we-we were like, we were watching Supermarket Sweep and Legends of the Hidden Temple, and I think Gack?

Wayne: Did—I didn’t watch Gack.

Trog: I think we watched a couple epi—or GUTS, that’s what it was, not Gack.

Wayne: In the past we used to—we used to watch the shows that were more akin to like, the fantasy type shit, like—like Knightmare.

Trog: Oh, yeah, yeah.

Wayne: Like, which, if you don’t know what Knightmare is, Knightmare is probably one of the funniest things to ever air on TV in earnest, which is like, it’s a show where kids would like, they would put a bucket on a kid’s head and make him stand in a room with a greenscreen while other kids would guide him through the greenscreen room.

Trog: [Crosstalk] Oh man.

[Baaulp laughs]

Baaulp: Yeah!

Gir: What? I’ve never heard of this show.

Trog: Oh, you didn’t watch those with us?

Log: They put a child in a diving bell and the other ones have to—have to provide direction via like, intercom.

Trog: We have to rewatch those. We have to rewatch those.

Baaulp: It is a very British take on the Nickelodeon type gameshows for kids where it’s like, “Okay, we can build an extravagant set, or, we can just greenscreen everything and use matte paintings.” “Well, but then the kid just sees green.” “Well, okay, well, y’know, maybe we have like, people in green suits jumping around and we just tell the kids beforehand that y’know, hey listen, it’s for the show, you’re only going to see green, just use your imagination.” “No, let’s just put a bucket on their head so they don’t see anything!” Like—[laughs].

Wayne: [Laughs] It’s like—it’s like literally a bucket. It’s—

Trog: They can’t-they can’t witness it.

Wayne: It’s actually a bucket. It might have some like paint on it or something to make it look like a helmet—

Trog: It’s supposed to be a helmet.

Baaulp: Yeah, it’s a bucket! [Laughs]

Wayne: But it’s like—but it’s like—the kid-the kid can see out the bottom like a bucket.

Log: It’s just incredibly funny because like, because of this, because the kid can’t see anything and it’s all greenscreen, they’re like, in very dire situations during the show like-like you walk into—

Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

Log: —Like they walk into the wrong room and their-their like—their skin evaporates or something and it just shows a little animation of like, skin going away from a head and leaving a skull, and the skull explodes.

[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

Log: It’s like, oh, the kid doesn’t—like the kid’s just standing there, y’know.

Baaulp, laughing: Yeah!

Log: Like-like, if they-if they lose—If they lose they’re not even gonna know, they’re gonna like fall off a pit but they’re just standing there.

Wayne: And then his guides are like, “Sorry Jimmy, your face melted.”

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Exactly. It’s a combination of like, the kid with the bucket on his head has no agency, right? It’s like—

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: Okay, it’s the kid with the bucket on his head and then it’s like their three friends like, looking at a little CRT monitor with the computer graphics on it trying to like, direct them. So, it’s a combination of the kid with the bucket could be dumb, and also it’s like, kids trying to give directions. Like, like little—

Wayne: It’s great.

Trog: Like, small kids. Not like—I would say probably like, grade school, right? Like, first through fifth grade.

Wayne: You will have the child-like, the chi—the only capable in a child error where like, the guide—the British guide kid will go like, “Left! Left!” And the kid will just clearly, obviously step to the right, like—

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: There’s just like, there’s both-there’s both an inability to create directions, and an inability to process them in the correct way.

Baaulp: It’s been a long while since we watched that show, but I distinctly remember this happening a lot, they’d be like, [in a British accent] “Okay Daniel, you’re-you’re in a room with—and with a-with lava underneath and you’ve got to pass this bridge but it’s not a straight shot so I’ll be guiding you. Okay, move—step to your right.” “My right or your right?” [Laughs]

Trog, laughing: “What do you mean?”

Wayne: Yeah, yeah! They could-they could never translate that difference. Like, it was so difficult.

Gir: Ah, this is actually starting to sound familiar. I think, I think I’m like on the cusp of remembering exactly what we watched.

Baaulp: You definitely watched this with—this shit with us [laughs].

Trog: We should absolutely rewatch these, it’s been long enough.

Wayne: Normally when we have ideas, like for a good thing to put—like, a good production to put on, we keep it to ourselves, but I’m gonna say this on the podcast because if-if this ever happened it would be a long time from now and most of you will forget, but I want to just do Knightmare.

Baaulp: You just want to do Knightmare? [Laughs]

Wayne: Like if-if we could—No, no, ‘cause let’s say—okay, let’s say we all go—let’s say we all go to Vegas, like, we could just rent like a giant greenscreen room like Jerma does, and just do Knightmare. Like, we’d just have to make the assets.

Trog: That is true.

Wayne: It would be so fucking funny, especially that concept but with like, our sense of humor and it being adults, I think would be so good.

Baaulp: Now would it still be fantasy based? Or would you pick a different setting?

Wayne: I think it has—I think it has to be.

Baaulp: It has to be fantasy?

Gir: I think that’s to be determined.

Wayne: To be determined. I think—I think fantasy’s the funniest, though.

Log: I think it should be—I think it should be Star Trek but you have a bucket on your head [laughs].

[Wayne, Baaulp, Trog and Gir laugh]

Baaulp: Oh my god that’s so good!

Wayne: “There’s a Romulan ahead, aim your phaser to the left, no-no-a little-no, to the right, ah.”

Gir: “To your—no.”

Baaulp: “My left or your left?”

Wayne: Ugh. Ohh.

Trog: That’d be good. Someday.

Log: “You have to reach the engineering room, it’s not a straight shot, though.”

Wayne: There’s just like, holes in the floor, like it’s the Star Trek Enterprise but there’s just—

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: —like, that’s the kind of obstacles that the kids in Knightmare had to face! It wasn’t just like, there’s like a trap you need to—you need to like disarm it, or you need to like move past this goblin, it would literally be like, they’d have to walk along a narrow bridge, and if they walked too far to the left they would just like drop the greenscreen footage, they would just pan it downwards so it looked like the kid fell, like—

Baaulp: “Alright Trog, uh, you’re at Ten Forward, Guinan wants to talk to you, okay?”

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: “Alright, take a step forward, okay, you’re not a-you’re—no, you’re not at the bar yet—"

Wayne: “You walked in the Holodeck.”

[Trog laughs]

Log: “The Enterprise is-is going to Starbase 74 for maintenance, there are holes in the ground of [unintelligible].”

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Wayne: Yeah, I think taking-taking the concepts that are present in Knightmare, like just random holes in the ground, and putting them in a place where they shouldn’t be is a great idea.

Gir: “Ah, sorry buddy, you clipped through the floor, there was a space anomaly you didn’t see.”

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: “There’s a room with three Klingons and they’re like, really angry. Okay, you’re gonna have to fight ‘em. Oh, dodge right! Dodge right-dodge right! Oh, well, you got stabbed.”

Wayne: “Watch out it’s the Borg, he’s shooting at you!”

Trog: I could have sworn that there was like, s—I could be misremembering this, because it’s been a long time since we’ve watched this, but I could have sworn there was like a-a room, that had like, like something rotating in the middle that they had to jump over, but it’s not real. Like, it’s like—

Baaulp: Yes!

Wayne: I do remember that.

Trog: —They just had to tell them, “Okay, jump now.” And it’s like, this seems impossible. Like yeah, ok, maybe the kids aren’t the best at giving directions, but this gameshow is like, rigged as well.

Wayne: I remember is-isn’t there—I remember there’s like a talking wall that like, they-they would like walk into a room and there’d be like a talking wall and it would like ask a riddle and if you just got it wrong three times he just killed you.

[Baaulp laughs]

Gir: Everyone’s got that wall in their house.

Baaulp: Like nineties British television for kids ranged from like insane to kind of awesome. I remember there’d be just like a lot of shows about video games. And not like-not like the way G4 was, it was just like, “Oh yeah, it’d be dope if we just had a Mortal Kombat tournament and just invited all these kids—”

Log: [Crosstalk] And you had to fight Baraka.

Baaulp: Yeah, you have to fight Baraka [laughs]. Like, that’s dope! Like, okay!

Log: Man, oh man. Y’know, there was video game talk in the uh, the dead recording that—

Trog: [Crosstalk] The lost episode.

Log: —of a bygone era, that the lost episode there was video game talk—There was a lot of talk about Fall Gay—Fall—

[Wayne, Baaulp, Gir, and Trog laugh]

Trog: Oh, noooo.

Wayne: Lot of talk about them Fall Gays.

Log: Yeah, there was a lot of talk about Fall Guys, um, we’re not gonna talk about that. Fuck that. Um, I’ll talk about a game I played, okay?

Gir: Okay.

[A beat of silence before Log laughs a little]

Gir: Take the reins.

Log: Do I—Do I have permission?

Trog: Yeah.

Log: Okay. Hylics 2 came out a while ago.

Baaulp: Ohhhhh.

Log: And I-I started playing it whenever it came out, and I like, stopped because it didn’t have controller support. It had like, half of a controller support. You could use the D-pad and that was it. Um, but then recently they added controller support to it so I started playing it, I started playing it on stream. That’s a good ole game, I gotta say.

Baaulp: Nice! Yeah, it looks cool!

Log: It’s-it’s weird ‘cause the first Hylics game, like, nothing made sense. Every NPC spoke in randomly generated dialogue um—

Wayne: Yeah, does Hylics 2 still have the randomly generated bullshit? Like, I liked it.

Log: Nah-no, the-the—Every NPC still like, talks in bullshit but it’s like, written bullshit instead of procedurally generated.

Gir: Meaningful bullshit.

Log: Like the—You’ll-you’ll meet a party member and he says, “I’m looking—I’m-I’m at this beach looking for a cabinet.” Um, but he-but he’ll always say that. Um, so it’s good, uh, it’s a turn-based RPG, the RPG part is pretty hard, um, I thought the first boss—There’s just like a whole bunch of shit that I didn’t expect. Like, I was just walking around and I clicked-I like clicked on a thing and it took me into a 2D platformer section—

Wayne: Yeah. That was in the trailers.

Log: It’s like-it’s like fuckin’ uh, it was like Mario and Luigi y’know, Superstar Saga they had those little things.

Wayne: Mhmm.

Log: It’s like that. Yeah, like, there’s like alternate ways to like solve the problems in areas, surprising. And they started talking about a gibbylet.

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: What?

Log: Yeah.

Trog: What’s that?

Log: It’s uh, it’s a piece of a gibby.

Trog: Oh.

Gir: Sure, man.

Log: I don’t know, I was just-I was just pleased to read gibbylet because we s—we always talk about joglets and troglets and here’s a game where now I have to like go out and find a gibbylet and kill it.

[Wayne and Baaulp laugh]

Baaulp: So it—so it-so it’s nice to know Mason Lindroth has the same—is on the same wavelength as us, is [what] you’re saying?

Log: Yeah.

Gir: I mean, the main character’s name is Wayne.

Baaulp: Ooohhhh.

Wayne: Yeah that’s uh, that’s not a coincidence. It’s not a coincidence, it’s fully intentional.

Gir: One hundred percent.

Trog: It’s not a coincidence because the person thought of that and chose it. It wasn’t pick—It wasn’t determined at complete random.

Gir: They didn’t write the name down and look down and go, “Oh, that’s a good name!”

Wayne: I played Hylics 1 for a bit, but like, that game was har—kind of impenetrable, like—It was—I just had no clue what I was fucking doing and I think I died really early on and it just like—never touched it again.

Log: Oh, yeah. It’s—Hylics 1 and 2 are like Dungeons and Dragons in that action economy is everything.

Wayne: Yeah.

Log: Um, Hylics 2 is a lot better in that it gives you uh, two of your party members very early on.

Wayne: Mhmm.

Log: Um, in Hylics 1 you’re just kind of stuck as just Wayne for a long time and you get your ass beat by everything.

Wayne: [Laughs] It’s-It’s—It was hard as fuck. Um, but yeah, visually that game was one of a kind and very, very cool, as well. I should maybe check out Hylics 2.

Trog: Talking about weird, like, abstract video games, I played Anodyne 1 and 2 uh, recently. Both games are really good. I would highly recommend those to anybody who likes uh, weird, heady, confusing narrative based video games with a little bit of puzzles thrown in.

Log: That game is really funny looking, it looks like the Nickelodeon Movie Maker.

Trog: A little bit, yeah. I mean, Anodyne 2 is 3D with 2D sections, and Anodyne 1 is entirely 2D. Um, but the 3D sections in Anodyne 2 are definitely going for like a retro PS1-ish era kind of feel.

Wayne: Yeah, that's the- I was watching some of your streams, like I just peeked in and out, and like, I saw some of those bits, like, going between those two different aesthetics- the PS1, or like N64 areas lookin' areas were like really cool. Like, a lot of-- a lot of articles 'n' shit and people are talking about how like, that is- that's the era that we're entering? Is like, oh yeah, we just went through the 16 bit and like 32 bit, sort of, uhh... there was that era of nostalgia and like kind of bringing that aesthetic back, and now we're in N64 and PS1 retro style games? And that's fucking dope, I can't want to see more stuff like that.

Trog: Yeah, to me, that's like, hey. That's...

Wayne: Prime.

Trog: I'm all, hit me with that nostalgia bait for the N64 era because that's when I was a kid, and that's what I have nostalgia for. I've been playing a Banjo-Kazooie ROM hack that turns all the areas of Ocarina of Time into Banjo-Kazooie levels. That's...

Wayne: I saw!

Trog: That's how much... That's how much I love the Nintendo 64. I'm playing mashup ROM hacks now.

Gir: How is that?

Wayne: Is it all of Ocarina of Time?

Trog: It is a significant amount! It is basically every area except for like, the fire temple. It's like, pretty much the whole game.

Gir: [Crosstalk] Well, who cares about the fire temple.

Wayne: Why'd they skip the fire temple?

Trog: I dunno. I remember reading something that the devs said, and they were like, somebody asked like, "Oh, are you ever gonna go back and add in the fire temple- the fire temple and the shadow temple, because neither of those two are in?" And the dude was like, "I literally can't. There's no more room in the ROM."

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: I was thinking it might be something like that.

Trog: "I used up every last byte available for this ROM hack."

Gir: You'd have to- you'd probably have to have Banjo-Kazooie get fucking dumped. Get their ROMs, like...

Trog: Something, yeah. But hey, that-that ROM hack's really good. I think it's called Banjo-Kazooie: The Jiggies of Time, so... if you, if you like 3D platformers, that one's pretty dang good.

Log: I wonder if it's like, we're fixing to run out of eras to be nostalgic for, really.

Baaulp: That's what I was gonna say!

Log: 'Cause yeah, like, 16 bit, alright, uh, Nintendo 64, PlayStation 1 era, like once you get to the PlayStation 2, GameCube whatever, that's not really charming anymore.

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: Yeah, the graphics are like, the graphics start to be, just like, "hey, we're trying to be realistic", and now things are very realistic looking games. But now it's like, are we, like what... Maybe I can foresee, I can foresee us being nostalgic for that, but what is gonna happen with video games graphics in the next 20 years that is gonna make us re- uh, nostalgic for that?

Wayne: It won't happen.

Gir: The nostalgia factor will be for the games themselves, rather than like, the style of the game.

Baaulp: I guess, yeah.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: People are gonna get nostalgic for just like the weird ass shovelware on the PS2.

Gir: I mean, obviously!

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: I mean, yeah. I think that like-

Trog: Yeah!

Wayne: -there could be that kind of, like, era, for like PS2 games, but it'll be like the shit- shit ones.

Trog: Yeah, whenever you're talking about nostalgia for certain, like, you're right in that it's not like the PS2, GameCube era, it is specific PS2 GameCube games. 'Cause whenever I think of stuff like that, I think of games with a very specific, uh, visual style. Like, you have Katamari, you have Jet Set Radio...

Gir: Yeah.

Trog: You have like, you have these games that went for a specific feel...

Wayne: And that's already happening!

Trog: Exactly! And you already see games, that- that try to do that same kind of feel.

Wayne: Tho-those sort of nostalgia trip games are already happening like, you have-you have Lethal League and their new title that looks
like—that is literally just a spiritual successor to Jet Set Radio, with Hideki Naganuma doing the whole fuckin’ soundtrack.

Baaulp: Dude, someone needs to make—'cause EA won’t—someone needs to make SSX, dude. Make SSX!

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Our friend Brandon is doing Monkey Ball. Like, they’re-they’re making a new Monkey Ball!

Log: Yeah, if somebody made just like a game that was like SSX3, I would be so down.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: That would be dope!

Gir: Wind Waker’s my case in point, by the way. Look at how many things imitated Wind Waker, in style and gameplay.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Log: Hold on a second, ‘cause we talked about Jet Set Radio. It’s like, I love Hideki Naganuma, they need to have more than just him for that soundtrack, though.

Baaulp: Oh, yeah, like—

Log: People-people don’t-people don’t know that like, Baaulp’s been playing the original Jet Set Radio—

Baaulp: Uh-huh.

Log: Uh, people don’t realize just like, how many people are on those soundtracks, like—

Baaulp: Oh, yeah.

Log: —Jet Set Radio, the original, has Rob Zombie Dragula in it.

Trog: Does it really?

Baaulp: Yeah, it has a remix of Rob Zombie’s Dragula, it has a track from Jurassic 5 on it, and it has like, a l—it has a—like, Hideki Namanuma-Naganuma worked on the soundtrack, but he is not the entirety of it, like, there was a lot of love put into that. And honestly, hey, I’m not-I’m not worried though, because like, okay get Hideki Naganuma, awesome, uh, just get like a whole bunch of, like, where-look at the day and age we live in like, I don’t listen to anyone on the top fi—I don’t listen to anyone who’s been on a Billboard chart, like-like yeah, just get like whoever like, get—does their music sound good? Fit the bill? Nice.

Wayne: Whether he-whether they-that he literally does the whole soundtrack or if he’s just like, or if he does a bunch of it and there are other artists, I’m excited either way because like they got him for like, the Lethal League 2 soundtrack, but he only had one song.

Baaulp: Right.

Wayne: And it’s an amazing song, but I was like, “Damn, I want more.” Some of these-some of the songs in that game were fucking awesome. Klaus Veen made like, a ton of tracks that I now have like, hundreds of plays on Spotify at this point. Like Ordinary Days, Candyman’s theme? That’s the shit.

Log: Yeah, Bring-bring on-bring on Klaus Veen.

Wayne: I hope they do.

Log: Uh, get my boy Nanoray on there.

Wayne: That would be fuckin’ awesome! Oh, man. I wish I knew those devs, I would be like, “Yo, look at this guy.”

Baaulp: Yeah, just get-just get people-just get—Yeah. Just like-like, just fuckin’ make this like, let people have their shot. This is a cool chance. That game is so fuckin’ hard, it has not aged well.

Wayne: No, I couldn’t get into it the one time I tried to play
it.

Baaulp: The gameplay it is—you can definitely tell it was a game released in 2001. The controls are like, so stiff, it’s so hard to do everything.

Log: You really are on rollerskates.

Baaulp: Yeah!

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: You gotta play Future, I hear that one is better. The—

Baaulp: That one’s also stranded.

Wayne: Future’s inaccessible, like—

Baaulp: Yeah. The other thing that like, uh, I wasn’t expecting, is that game to-to have stayed relevant, because the first-the first thing thatthe game says is like, “We’re-we’re street punks, and the police are after us,” and the police are like, pulling no punches. They are literally shooting at you, they are literally throwing grenades at you, teargas [laughs]. It’s like, oh, I didn’t expect this game to be this rele-dysto—

Wayne: That way.

Baaulp: Yeah, to hit that way.

Wayne: It does.

[Trog laughs]

Baaulp: I like, [laughs] I thought it was just a “Grrr, these kids are-are messing around with graffiti, we gotta-I dunno, throw like a cartoon net over them, I-like—

[Trog and Wayne laugh]

Baaulp: I didn’t-I didn’t, like, when they’re like, “We’re gonna start—”

Wayne: Uh-oh.

Baaulp: Yeah, like, they like, especially in the first few levels they’re like, “Ah, start teargassing ‘em,” I’m like, woah. [Laughs] What? So, yeah, it’s a, weirdly relevant, on that front.

Wayne: Uh, one more game before we move onto other topics. I would say the one that we-a lot of here have touchin’ and lookin’ at has been Risk of Rain 2, the 1.0 update.

Trog: Oh, yeah.

Wayne: The end has finally come, uh, and I have a lot of thoughts, I mostly think it’s dope, um, the final boss has some problems, but I think overall I’m happy with it. Trog, how do you feel about that final boss?

Trog: I think that Risk of Rain 2, the 1.0 update—Risk of Rain 2 as an entire gameplay experience is great, I would recommend it to anybody who likes third-person action games and rogue-lites, I think it’s kind of obvious if you’ve been keeping up with the game and you’re coming into the 1.0 update from the last one, I think you can kind of see that they were definitely trying to hit a deadline. I think that what they have added in the 1.0 update is a little rough around the edges, but it’s not bad in any way. The game itself is not bad, it’s definitely worth playing, I’m still—

Wayne: The game is great!

Trog: The game is great, I’m still enjoying it.

Wayne: One of my favorite games of the past few-like, past year or two. It came out in early access, I don’t know if it’s my game of the year, but.

Trog: But, the 1.0 update stuff is-feels uh, uh slightly half-baked. It’s just not as big of an update as you would expect from like, a 1.0 release.

Wayne: You know why I can like, be like, biased and like kind of brown-nose the update a little bit? Ah, single-handedly is the-the fucking composer made a sequel to Coalescence, which is like, one of my favorite tracks in any video game. The final-the final area of Risk of Rain 1 has like, the most amazing track, and the-the song they use for the final area of Risk of Rain 2 is pretty much just like a-like a—it is a reinterpretation of that same
song, same motif, with a new spin and it’s just as good. It’s-I would say maybe not as good, but very, very close, and it’s fucking awesome. That final area is so cool visually with that music.

Log: Yeah, I think that the music was the only thing that met the bar, really.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: I thought-I thought the rest didn’t really meet standards. The-the final level in Risk of Rain 1, like in Providence and stuff, were just much better.

Wayne: It is-in terms of gameplay, yeah. Much cooler. Risk of Rain 2, that area looks really cool, but all it is is you run on a bridge for five minutes and then you fight the boss.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: The like—I don’t know I, for whatever reason, if you-if you play Risk of—Risk of Rain 1, you can’t loop in the same way you can loop in Risk of Rain 2, unless you can, am I mixed up on that?

Log: Yeah, you can loop.

Wayne: You can loop? Okay, so Risk of Rain 1, let’s say you play the game for a while and then you loop and then you play the game for a while, and then you up deciding to go to the final level. The-that last level is
fuckin’ crazy, like with how many enemies there are and the difficulty like, and the amount of items it gives you like-it’s like one final power spike for
you while the game throws everything it has at you. If you loop in Risk of Rain 2, you will play like you’re-you’ll be on like level nine or whatever, and there will be overloading worms all other the place and it’ll be crazy and you’ll be like, about to die at all times, then you go to the final level and there’s four enemies. I don’t-I don’t know why, but like—

Trog: Yeah, it’s kinda lame.

Wayne: —The enem-the enemies there are cool and strong, but it’s just like, does-I-it’s so—

Trog: It’s very empty.

Wayne: It’s so barren. Yeah, it’s completely empty.

Trog: And I feel like that’s by design.

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: Like, maybe not from-maybe not by design from a gameplay standpoint, but from like a, y’know, either a narrative or just like an aesthetic—

Wayne: It’s a-I think it’s a lore thing.

Trog: Yeah, either lore or aesthetic, they wanted that area to feel empty, but that doesn’t translate into super good gameplay, is the thing.

Wayne: The final bosses’ name is literally The King of Nothing, so I imagine that’s why the Moon is like that.

Trog: Yeah. It’s probably an aesthetic thing, which I-I can [unintelligible].

Wayne: [Crosstalk] And I think-I think with how good-with
how good the gameplay is outside of like the-its-its-its shortcomings there, I think-I think it’s-I think it’s okay that they leaned for the aesthetic more than like, the actual final level being—

Trog: Sure. Because the thing is that you don’t really get
anything for beating the final boss… more than once. You unlock a new character
when you beat it once and I think you should get something for beating it on Monsoon.

Wayne: [Crosstalk] On each difficulty! You get one of-you get one of the craziest blue items if you beat it on Monsoon, I have yet to do it. I’m excited to do it.

Trog: So, so it’s like you can honestly kind of ignore that and play the game like how you played it before the update, where you’re just going for the longest run possible which I think is more fun, I think it’s more
fun to just see how far and how crazy of a build you can get rather than just
going for the final boss or whatever.

Wayne: Yeah. But there are—Yeah, and-but-and I-and I like that you can use the two together, like you can go like super long and then when it’s
like, “Okay, I’m starting to get bored, let’s go see how-if I can take on the
final boss like this,” ‘cause the final boss keeps getting stronger, too. Like
the longer that you keep playing.

Trog: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: And that-when it comes to that fight—we haven’t actually talked about the boss itself that much—uh, that boss has some bullshit in there, especially the first time that you fight it—Hey, if you’re listening now, and you haven’t played it yet, wh-when the boss jumps you need to jump. You need to stay in the air for like, at least like, ten seconds. When he lands, you will die if you’re on the ground.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: We’re telling you that now because some of our friends were not told that and they were very mad. In fact, Trog here had that experience, um—

Trog: It’s just the kind of thing where the final boss design seems a little incongruous with the rest of the boss design and the enemy design in the game, in that it feels like they were making a Dark Souls boss for a game where it takes you thirty minutes to get to the final boss, right?

Wayne: Mhmm.

Trog: Like, it’s not like Dark Souls where it’s like, alright, you can have your boss have bullshit one-hit attacks in Dark Souls, because you die and you’re at the bonfire and you spend thirty seconds walking back to the
boss fight and you just try it again. But that doesn’t work in a rogue-like where it’s like, alright, I’ve got a good build for the first-like, I’ve done
ten runs, this if the first run in ten runs where I have a good build, I’m
gonna go, I’m gonna do the boss—It just did something that I have no idea it
could have done, and I’m dead. And now my run is over.

Wayne: Other-other rogue-lites like, when you—the-the-the-the
thing is is like, some-some other games it takes just as long to get to the final boss, like the-the Dead Cell’s final boss you have to play the game for a long time to get there, and that boss is hard as fuck, I’ve never beaten it.

Trog: [Crosstalk] That is true.

Wayne: Um, the uh, like I think-I think the amount of time that you have to go there, in my opinion, is-can be both infuriating, but I think the fact that so much like-so much of your time and effort weighs on
like, how you manage to fair I think is like, it’s fitting to me, and it-it
makes it cool. Like, the-the time where I actually did it, like the-the one time I beat the final boss—like, I cheesed it a little bit at the beginning, but when you get to the very final stage—spoilers, if you don’t want me spoiling the boss—the very final stage of the boss is he takes away all of your items and you have to fight him raw while you progress and try to get your items back. And I was like, I had like a kind of weak build, I was jumping around, I was hitting him with lightning whenever I could, and when I got to that phase I was like, “Fuck, it’s on.” And I jumped up and got in front of his face and just fuckin’ like, APM’d the shit out of him with Mercenary and I managed to kill him, like, while he was giving me my items back, like, before he took everything or whatever, and it felt so good to finally get it done.

Trog: I think that final phase is honestly one of the things I really don’t like about it, because every time I’ve gotten-every time I’ve attempted the final boss and gotten to that final phase and I didn’t have some sort of cheese strategy, or I wasn’t playing a character that has a mobility skill, you just get hosed, man. Like, I tried doing it—

Wayne: Certain characters can’t do it.

Trog: Yeah, I tried doing it as REX and it’s like, I am too sl—like, he takes every single one of your items, right?

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: REX is a character that has no-or limited mobility. Like, and slow to begin with.

Wanye: [Crosstalk] I almost did it as REX.

Trog: So it’s like, I can’t dodge the attacks and then I just die. And it’s like, the devs even said like, people were talking about how the third phase was bullshit, and the devs even came out in like a blogpost and said like, “Yeah, the third phase wasn’t supposed to be the hard part of that fight, the third phase was just supposed to be kind of like uh, ‘oh shit’ moment the first time it happens, but it wasn’t supposed to be like what you…
like gear up for,” so I think they will probably end up tweaking that.

Log: Yeah, a lot of it just didn’t seem very thought out.
Like the-the-the death island that you could go to and softlock your game.

Trog: Yeah, there was a-there was an island where you just
softlock.

Wayne: There’s just an island where if you go on it, at
least in like the-before they patched it, I still don’t know if they have. If
you didn’t have enough mobility skills, you would just get stuck, and it happened
to me and Erarg when we were playing once, and like, I-we literally like—I had
mobility, he didn’t, so he was just stuck over there and I watched him struggle
and I was like, “Okay, we’re gonna find out how the fuck to get you out of this,”
because if you’re in multiplayer, you can’t spawn the final boss until everyone’s
there, and he had no way to suicide because when you jump off the ledge it only
brings you down to one health. So what we did was I had him like, jump, and
then I walked under him—No, I had-I had him jump on top of me because you have
like a physical hitbox for other players, and then I had him jump and then I
double-jumped, and hitting him restored his jumps, so like, I boosted him off
my head to the final boss and it took us like ten minutes to get it right. It
was-it was bullshit.

Log: Had to enact troll physics to play the game [laughs].

Trog: Yeah. There’s just-I think—yeah. Like I said at the
beginning of the conversation, I think it’s obvious they were trying to hit a
deadline, they were set on that deadline—and I respect them for sticking to the
deadline, but I feel like this is a situation where maybe they could’ve said like,
“Hey guys, I know we had we had this date,” and who knows, maybe it was out of their
control, I don’t know who their publisher is it could be that they had to release
it—

Log: Gearbox.

Trog: Yeah, so maybe it was like, maybe the date was totally
out of their hands, but I feel like this would have been a situation where it
would have been okay to be like, “Hey guys, we need like, another month. Like,
trust us, it’ll be good, but we just need one more month and then we’ll release
it.” And I feel like that-that’ll be good. Again, not that I dislike the game
in any way, I think that it’s great, I would highly recommend it, but just-if
you’ve been keeping up with the game, the 1.0 update is a little half-baked.

Wayne: Now that Risk of R-chat-Rain is over, Gir, what have
you been playing?

Gir: Fuck all.

Trog: Alright.

Wayne: Really, video games aren’t doing it for you these days?

Gir: If it’s not been on stream, I’ve not really played anything.
I’ve done hardly anything off stream lately.

Wayne: Hmm.

Gir: I think the only thing in the last few days I’ve played
is literally because it came out like last night, was Flight Simulator.

Wayne: Yeah, have you-how much of that did you touch?

Gir: Uh… enough to know that I really should just have a
flight stick.

Wayne: Is it-is it cool, though? Like, the—

Gir: Yeah, I mean it’s cool.

Wayne: Does it not play well with the Xbox controller?

Gir: Eh, it doesn’t play well with my Xbox controller.

Wayne: Oh. What’s wrong with yours?

Gir: My stick is like, o—it’s like, really fucked up oversensitive stick.

Wayne: Mhmm.

Gir: Uh, it’s got uh, drift on it and everything. And you don’t want drift when you’re trying to keep a fucking plane straight.

Wayne: Yeah.

Gir: So, yeah, I think if I get into that game more I’ll have to like, invest in a flight stick of some kind.

Wayne: I uh, saw some funny shit from that game already. And
like, the concept is super interesting with like, them having the whole world
mapped out with satellite data, you can go anywhere, like that’s pretty-it’s-you
see that—

Trog: I can go to my house?

Wayne: You see that country? You can fly to it.

Gir: I did take the time to fly over my house.

Wayne: You can! You can go to your house!

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: Someone found Grover House, like that’s-you can—

[Gir laughs]

Baaulp, laughing: Holy shit! Holy shit!

Wayne: Yeah, you can go to Grover House, you can-there—I saw
on Tumblr a post that was like, the game is multiplayer, and it-it’s like—Gir,
is it like server based or is it just like you see other people playing
the game, it’s like just a wide—like Sea of Thieves.

Gir: It’s like a shard-based type deal.

Wayne: Yeah! So it’s like-it’s like Sea of Thieves.

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: Like-that’s-that’s fuckin’ dope. The post that I saw
was like-like a bunch of planes landed on an island and the caption was like, “Yeah,
everyone is just flying to Epstein’s island. We’re gonna solve this ourselves.”

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: There were like eight biplanes landed on Epstein’s island.
Yeah, I might have to check it out even though I’m not usually into those kind
of games, especially because it’ll get VR support soon.

Baaulp: It seems like, with that in that context like, “Oh
yeah, we have the entire world mapped out,” it seems like really dope to just
explore.

Gir: Yeah.

Baaulp: I would love to just-to just like-yeah, find my own
house and just like, go around and uh—

Gir: The thing to remember though is it is—everything is to scale. So, if you want to get somewhere that would take two hours to fly to, it is going to take two hours to fly there.

Trog: That’s pretty wild.

Baaulp: But-but like-but like, who cares. Yeah, who cares.
Like, fuck it.

Gir: Hell, I mean if that’s what you want to do, then you do
that, by all means.

Wayne: Can I play like, super mode. Can I play hyper mode
where I fly like, a jet rocket and I [laughs].

Gir: I mean, there is a jet.

Baaulp: You can like-you can get out of your plane too, is
that correct?

Gir: No.

Trog: You can’t jump out of your plane while it’s moving?

Log: It’s like-it’s like Tony Hawk’s Underground.

Wayne: That’s a-that’s a shame, there’s no like-there’s no like
Test Drive Unlimited 2 element, like that would be pretty cool.

Baaulp: If that was available y’know what I’d do, I’d just
like-I’d just like fly over my own house and jump out and like, land on my own
house [laughs].

[Wayne laughs]

Log: They added in a feature where if you crash your plane
your pilot can get out, and if you mash a button fast enough it raises his rage
meter and he can do a sick trick to destroy his plane.

Wayne: [Laughs] He breaks the plane in half. He steps on the
plane and smashes it to pieces.

Gir: I will say they-they have some like, they have a lot of
like variety in the like how-how easy do you want this to be. Do you want this
to be an arcade game or do you want this to be a straight fucking simulator. So
you can turn off all of the like—you can fly straight into the ground if you
want, you can fuckin’ do backflips all day long—

Wayne: Can you like, is there cool destruction if you have like-like
all the rules on, if you fly into the ground do you get like fuckin’
obliterated?

Gir: If you fly too sharply, the game just says, “Hey, you
flew so hard that you would have ripped the wings off of a real plane. Therefore,
it is over. Restart.

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: Aw, you don’t get any animation? That-that’s—aw, come
on.

Gir: You don’t get any animation—It just cuts to black, you
hear like a-like a VRRRrrrrr, like a—

Wayne: You have to watch like a PSA about why you shouldn’t
fly like that.

[Gir and Log laugh]

Wayne: You fucked up. All your passengers are dead. Yeah, I’ll
have to-I’ll have to look into that. But yeah, uh, another thing I wanted to
talk about, like, based on something you said, you said like, “Yeah, you haven’t
been playing a whole lot of games off stream lately,” uh, since May, which was
when our last podcast was, uh, our Twitch Team, Radio TV Solutions, has really kicked
into gear. I think around that time was probably when we actually formed it,
right? Like it would have been around May. Around-around the time—

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah.

Trog: Uhh…

Gir: June.

Trog: June, yeah.

Wayne: May-man-June, so yeah. Like, all of us stream now,
uh, some of us more than others. Uh, and it has been a lot of fun, it’s been-I
feel like we’ve all been having a good chunk of success, it’s been a good time.
Uh, the—one thing I want to talk about here a little bit, is like, Gir I feel
like you in particular, like you’ve been doing like, a ton of streaming. Like,
and you said that—

Gir: Oh, yeah.

Wayne: You-you-you said that-you said that you haven’t been
playing a whole lot off stream because you’ve been doing so much on stream. The—how
do you like, at-at-at—Do you ever see that becoming a problem? Like-like, in
the way of like, some streamers that I know who stream all the fuckin’ time
talk about how like video games are like shot for them because of streaming. Like,
if they’re not-if they’re playing a game off stream they can’t help but hear
that nagging voice in their head like, “I should be streaming this.” And it
makes them-it makes the games hard to enjoy.

Gir: Yeah, uh—

Wayne: Are you-are any of you-I’ll talk to all of you guys
here—

Gir: I’ve already started feeling that, to an extent. Like, I
will-I will get a game and it’s like, “Oh, this is gonna be a fun game, I
should probably stream this, though—”

Wayne: And then like if you-and then like-for-for me, this
might be the same for you, Gir, is like, I get that thought, and it doesn’t necessarily
make the game not fun for me, but it makes it more stressful, I’m like, “Damn,
I could be, there could be so many ‘haha funny’ moments if I were playing this
on stream. This could be such a good entertaining game for the folks,” and I
just have that stress of like, and I misusing my time, here? So far, hasn’t
ruined it for me. Baaulp, what were you saying?

Baaulp: I-I am privy to that. I try to avoid it, and the way I avoid it is that I kind of like, I kind of in my mind, at the-at the risk of sounding egotistic, in my mind I like, I tell myself that I’m the show. Not the games, I am. So whatever game I play is whatever people will want to watch, and that’s-that—I’ve been able-for example, there’s been no-I’ve like, there are some games that I keep to myself, not be-not because I’m like, “Ooh, this is my game and the audience doesn’t get to see this,” but like, “Oh, no one’s gonna wanna watch me play Magic the Gathering.” Like, that’s not, y’know what I mean?

Wayne: I feel like I can do both reasons. Like I have some games
where I-I don’t stream it because like, I don’t think this would make for an
entertaining stream, like Risk of Rain 2, for instance. I streamed it when it
launched because that was like an event, but other than that, that game doesn’t—like
nobody really—like it’s kind of just us y’know, going at it, doing the grind.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: There’s not anything like to talk about, there’s nothing
special there.

Baaulp: Yeah like ga—like yeah. And then like, uh, for
example, I’ll stream Tekken all the time, and I’ll play it myself and like, the
enjoyment with that has not changed at all.

Gir: For me it’s more a matter of if I’m playing something
off stream, and something really fucking funny happens, I just feel that hint
of regret that I had no clue of it ever happening.

Wayne: Yeah, I’ve had that happen, too. Sometimes-sometimes that also—that’ll happen in a game-like I’ve had some crazy shit happen in Fall Guys where it’s like, “I fucking wish I was recording that,” like that doesn’t make any sense. Then also, that’ll happen even when we’re not playing games. Like there’ll just be a really funny conversation and like, I’m like, “Damn, that would have been good if we were recording this somehow. Like that would have been a good moment to preserve.”

Baaulp: I-I don’t think it’s healthy to have that want—Like for me, in my mind, I guess that’s because I like come from like, I guess I’m more professional like—every job I’ve had before this has been like very professional. And like, clear separation of like, “Hey, maybe there’s some overlap here, but this is my time versus work time.”

Wayne: Oh, yeah. And I mean, I have that too, but because-the nature-the nature of this job, the nature of what we do just means that there is like, like you can try to make sure that there’s little overlap, but like there-there just is overlap. One of my biggest hobbies is video games, that is also my job. That overlap is just inherent. I was gonna—

Trog: [Crosstalk] I um, I don’t stream—Oh, sorry.

Wayne: I was going to ask you the question next. I feel like your approach, Trog, in streaming on this team has been different from
everybody else’s. When playing games, at least.

Trog: Yeah, I don’t know. I don’t plan on streaming as like a
source of income, I—

Wayne: You’re the producer.

Trog: The way that I have been tackling Twitch is like, do I
think this will be entertaining for people? If so, I’ll stream it. Or if, y’know
sometimes, I feel like the thing with um, the turning point for a Twitch stream
is when you have enough people in your chat that you can keep up a conversation
with them. ‘Cause we-we do a lot of Twitch viewing of literal zero viewer Twitch
streams and it’s like, if you are streaming to an audience of zero, you are
simply playing a video game, right?

Wayne: Mhmm.

Trog: You’re not really doing anything, I feel like the
turning point is whenever you can get enough viewers that there’s somebody, y’know
like a handful of people that will talk in the chat and you can have some sort
of dialogue with them. And I feel like we are all at that level now, but for me
I’m not doing it as a source of income, so I’m basically just selling my emotes
to people, is how I kind of tackle it.

Wayne: [Laughs] That’s fun.

Trog: It’s like, look, I am an affiliate, therefore I have
emotes, I want emotes so that I can use them, so if you want, you can buy these
emotes from me for five dollars.

Wayne: When you play your games, there’s like, you-like, I
notice when like, watching your streams, you are very much more showcasing
like, sharing the game that you’re playing and sharing the experience and like-like-like
alongside the chat and like, you will go long stretches of silence like just
focusing on the game, right? Like—

Trog: Sure. So, for instance I streamed Anodyne 2 and I
like, basically just didn’t talk for any of that just because like what-what do
you say? Like, I-the thing that I’m self-conscious about with streaming is that
I-I don’t want to fall into that like generic streamer mode where it’s just like,
y’know, y’know what the jokes are where it’s like, “Oh, look at the character! Look
at it go! Oh, it’s crazy, they performed a jump! Oh man, this is cra-oh,
you-you-can you guys see this? Oh, this is crazy.” And there’s just like,
fucking nothing going on stream and it’s like, “This dude is a psychopath, he’s
just-he’s just saying anything!”

[Baaulp laughs]

Gir: You gotta learn to be comfortable with silence every now
and then.

Wayne: My streams like, my streams have like-like I try-I
try to-I try to evoke a higher energy, like, I like chaos. I like intense moments
and shit like that, but like, the-when it comes-when nothing’s happening like,
I’ll still try to talk but like, I’m not gonna-I’m not—that’s like-I feel like
what you just described is like, Markiplier syndrome.

Gir, laughing: It’s a syndrome.

Trog: I-what I just did does not describe anybody on our Twitch
Team, just for the record.

Wayne: Yeah.

Gir: Markiplier disorder.

Trog: That’s like-that is describing a human that none of us
are. Like—

Wayne: Yeah [laughs].

Trog: That is like, a specific breed of like—and I just feel
like, for me it’s like, yeah, y’know, I want to let the game talk for itself. And
I’ll-I’ll like say out loud what my thought process is if I’m like, y’know, for
instance, okay, I’m playing the Banjo-Kazooie ROM hack or whatever, I’m like
thinking out loud like, “Alright I need to get-I’m gonna go grab these notes, I
saw some stuff over there,” but I’m not like commenting on every single thing
that the character is doing, and I don’t know. That just-that works for me.

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Mhmm. Everybody got their own approach.

Trog: I think people-I want people to enjoy the more laidback
attitude and I think I-I think I can bring that to the group, at least.

Wayne: Oh, yeah. For sure. I—If I get one piece of criticism
that like, I-my stream’s—it’s definitely valid, and like, a lot of like, the
different members of the team, you could avoid that by watching their stream
instead of mine, people are like, “Yeah, when I watch Wayne’s streams I get
overstimulated and it like, hurts my head.”

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: ‘Cause like a lot of the times, depending on what the stream is and what we’re doing, it can be that way. The—and it’s like, sometimes it’s a good thing, sometimes it’s the best thing, and I love it. And other times it’s wholly like, unintentional, like I’m just trying to like manage the amount of alerts like, with the music, with the game, with the-with our dialogue.

Log: You mean people don’t wanna see a combination Destiny 2 Runescape stream?

[Trog and Wayne laugh]

Wayne: I need to do another one of those. The—I, yeah. Like
those-those are the times yes, those are the times where I’m trying to overstimulate you, I’m trying to make your head explode through Twitch. The uh, but yeah-but I’m-I’m-I’m getting better at like, finding a sort of like, a median where like, okay, alerts are not going to like literally make it impossible for you to focus on like the dialogue, like certain streams I just have to forego like, maybe get a little bit less income but like, the show can be better.

Gir: Yeah, I will say I personally-I tried—

Wayne: You just turned off TTS.

Gir: I tried the text-to-speech thing for like, I dunno, like three or four weeks, and I was like, I can already see this snowballing to the point where I just can’t pay attention anymore. Like forget anyone else watching, I wasn’t able to pay attention, so.

Wayne: In my chat, when it works right, like, it is a great way for me to have discussions better. Like just because the size of the chat is so big that I can have those dialogues that like, you were talking about, but the problem is that it’s splintered. If I’m having a conversation with chat it is usually not the same person, but rather the chat talking to me collectively.

Trog: Yeah. Exactly. But that’s what happens when you have like,
a viewership that is an order of magnitude bigger than like—

Wayne: Yeah, yeah. It’s just inherent.

Trog: You have your zero view streams, you have your like,
tier one—like you two years ago, like twenty to fifty people.

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: Then you have like tier two, fifty to like, I would
say even up to like three or four hundred people. A chat is pretty much the
same from like, fifty to four hundred people, in my opinion.

Wayne: Mhmm.

Trog: But then like, you reach like, that four-digit number
and it’s just like, the chat is unreadable at that point.

Wayne: Then you enter Twitch jungle. That’s-that’s video
jungle.

Gir: Chat’s only good for turning into a pogchamp.

Trog: It just turns into like, an-an atomic bomb.

Wayne: [Laughs] I like both kinds of chats. And I’ve noticed
too, like, I can have a chat start like that, and then if I let the stream go
on too long into weird hours, I can like, go back down to a tier two style
chat, like when I did-when I did the Dark Souls-I did the Dark Souls San Andreas
stream when I streamed for ten hours ‘till like 9AM and uh, that was really fun
because the chat did slow down and I got to have like, more conversations.

Gir: Yeah, your chat was nice and-nice and calm that whole
time.

Wayne: Nice and calm.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: It’s fun-it’s fun to do a chill stream occasionally,
but the-I do-I do thrive on the chaos. Uh, and then—so, and then I guess the
only person I haven’t directly asked about the streams here is Log. Log, you
have, like, your main streams like, you’ve been streaming Hylics 2, right? But
then you, you’ve-you’ve been doing the art streams lately—Did you do a Gather
Ye Power stream this week?

Log: Yeah. Um, that’s what I did on Sunday before I started
playing Hylics.

Wayne: So, Log is a totally different niche covered in art, none of us are doing that.

Log: Yeah, it’s kind of a weird thing ‘cause it’s like, I don’t
think it’s something that people are generally interested in, and like, I-I get
it, ‘cause like even I’m not interested in that necessarily, like, um, the-the
guy who makes One-Punch Man, um—

Gir: ONE?

Log: Uh no, Yusuke Murata.

Gir: Oh.

Log: He-he does stream him working on the new chapters, but
like, even if I was interested, I don’t really want to like, tune in.

Gir: [Crosstalk] Huh!

Log: I don’t really, feel the-the need to watch the process
in real-time, ‘cause when you get down to it, art is just-it’s slow. Like, you’re
just there to have a little chat, really.

Wayne: Mhmm.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: Uhm, and whenever I’m working on it I just tend to
mumble to myself what I’m doing, so that’s not really like, the best viewer
experience. However, um, after switching over to Hylics 2 and playing a little
bit of that on stream for the first time, I feel like that’s like, what feels
most natural to me. ‘Cause like, I think the way that I work is that whenever I
am-am knowledgeable about something in a game I will like-I will just kind of
like, gush about it, and then whenever it gets into the stuff that I’m not as
knowledgeable about it, it’s much easier for something like Hylics where I just
get to just like, see it and handle it at whatever pace. It gives me time to like
just think about what’s going on.

Gir: Oh, yeah, I feel that.

Trog: Personally, I really like the art streams because they’re
just kind of like, well, it’s different for me than the viewers because
whenever you’re doing an art stream I can just pop in and like have a chat,
like, for real—

Wayne: Mhmm.

Trog: But I feel that it’s like-it’s kind of that atmosphere
where it’s like, you’re right, art is slow, but that means that if you aren’t
paying full attention, you aren’t going to miss anything. Like, it really is
just something to turn on and listen to and be like, “I’m gonna listen to these
people have a conversation,” y’know. It’s kind of like a podcast in itself.

Wayne: And also, Log’s got that baller taste in music. So
that also helps.

Trog: Yeah, the music’s good. It’s fun to play stream DJ. I’ve
been having a lot of fun just finding cool music I like to play at the start of
my stream, that’s always fun.

Wayne: Mhmm.

Log: Like, that-that—I feel like part of the thing where I
like these kind of RPG games, especially the ones like Hylics that are just
very interesting to see visually, is that I don’t really like, think in terms
of what’s really going on, I don’t know, it just feels very—

Trog: Abstract?

Log: It just feels very nat-it just feels very natural to just
like, determine something completely-just come up with something just completely
different than what’s just on screen.

Trog: Mhmm.

Log: I don’t-I don’t know-I don’t know how to like, I don’t
know how to-how to properly describe it. It just feels funnier.

Trog: Heh.

Log: Just because it’s-it just feels inherently funny just
because of like, being able to slow it down and take in all the stuff and see
all the weird things.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Mhmm.

Trog: I mean that’s-that’s definitely—I mean, that’s how Scorpy streams every game. Scorpy-Scorpy basically patented the, “stop everything that I am doing in the game and zoom in on something weird on the screen,” like—

Wayne: [Laughs] He was doing that-he was doing that long before we were even like, thinking of like having a Twitch Team and doing this as a group. Like, Scorpy—I like-I have such a vivid memory of a Scorpy stream from like, three years ago where we were watching him play a game called like, Sphinx the Curse of the Mummy or something like that. It’s just this horrible-it’s not even horrible, it’s just mediocre PS2 platformer where you play as like, some kid in Egypt and you jump around and like, I’ll never forget like, just this-this time where he just stopped the stream, was just like, silent for three minutes, and then zooms in on a sarcophagus and just pops up a little notepad window and it says—and it just said, I probably have the screenshot somewhere, it just said in plain text, all caps, “ENTERING THE SARCOPHAGUS WILL
KILL HIM” and it just hung on that for like two minutes.

Trog: [Laughs] Yeah.

Wayne: I will never forget that.

Gir: Something I want to say is uh, had things been different,
in terms of the ability to travel, I guarantee you I would have been doing
fishing streams every now and then.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: That’d be fun.

Baaulp: Ohhh, damn.

Gir: Had I had the opportunity to go on my vacation that I originally
was gonna go on, I definitely would have done that like, several times.

Wayne: So, I have like a number of IRL stream-type stuff
like that that I’ve wanted to do, and like people are always saying, “Wayne, woods
stream?” Like that’s the meme, that’s the joke. Like they always ask me for
woods stream. And I always say “I’ll give you woods stream one day,” which will
be a stream where I will walk around the woods. There have like those streaming
backpacks you can buy that are like twenty-five hundred dollars and like, honestly
like, that might be a good investment one day if I want to do more of this, but
that’s a good segue. Just recently—

Gir: Segway, you say.

Wayne: [Laughs] I didn’t, I don’t have a Segway. The-just recently,
I’ve-I keep talking about it on stream like, “Oh yeah, I’m getting into a
hobby,” and like I-like I haven’t wanted to tell people about it because I wasn’t
sure one hundred percent if I could pull it off, I wasn’t-I maybe wanted it to
be a surprise like if I did a stream with it, and I think one day I’ll maybe do
streams with it, the—I uh, just last week, uh, got-I received my first ever
electric unicycle, uh-the, which is a personal electric vehicle. 

Wayne: Think a hoverboard-kind of like a hoverboard, but one
wheel, much more powerful, much more serious. Uh, the-it, I got it last week on
Friday, and I have been absolutely obsessed with it since like… when would it have
been… I think-I think I-I figured it out um, Satur-it was Sunday—No, no, no,
Sunday is when I figured it out, Sunday’s when it clicked, and Sunday is when
it like-I just fell in fuckin’ love with it. I got it Friday night and I was in
the call here I-I took it outside and uh, I put it up, put it up behind my car.
Like, the first steps you’re supposed to take with the electric unicycle is like,
you’re supposed to support yourself against a wall, stand on it, and just like
wheel back and forth and just like feel what that’s like. And I was doing that,
and then like, I had never felt more exhausted just like jumping on that thing,
standing on it for two seconds, and then falling off. It was like, killing me.
I was-I like-I-I like couldn’t catch my breath for like three minutes, it was
bad.

Wayne: Um, and then I, just this last weekend I went away
for a funeral, and uh, we were at-we were at the funeral home and like we did
our stuff for a few good hours, paid our respects, and I went outside to like
practice, and I got like so discouraged because I was like, trying to do it and
it was just like, hurting the shit out of me, and I couldn’t pull off like anything.
The—Whe-whe-when you guys were young, how long did it take you to learn how to
ride a bike? Do you think? Or do-do—

Gir: God, I don’t remember, you kidding me?

Baaulp: I don’t remember.

Trog: Yeah, I don’t know.

Baaulp: At this point I haven’t rode a bike in so long I
think-I think I’ve gone back down to zero.

Wayne: You fuckin’ like—this is off-topic, this is a tangent,
too, but you-you obviously know the saying, you know the saying, like, “You never
forget how to ride a bike.” If I gave you a bike, do you think you could ride
it right now? Well?

Baaulp: No. No [laughs].

Wayne: I feel like I couldn’t, either. I feel like-like—

Trog: Really? I absolutely could ride a bike still.

Log: No idea.

Wayne: Maybe-I mean I’ve been building up my balance with
this thing so maybe I could do it, but like, so, the first night I put in an hour, I could maybe stay on the wheel for like, three seconds before I’d have to jump
off of it. Second day, I couldn’t even get that. I don’t-I don’t know why. I’ve been using this forum, which is a bizarre experience because it is literally like a PHB internet forum, it’s crazy that it still exists and it’s not like some other kind of-like a-like a Reddit community or whatever.

Trog: Other than Discord.

Wayne: Yeah-yeah it’s not just a Discord, it’s like an
actual genuine forum, it feels fuckin’ weird. It’s like I’m going back in time.
But like, I was-I was asking for tips and doing research, and like, the-the
advice that I got, there were-there were three prevailing pieces of advice. The-in
order to learn how to ride an electric unicycle. The-the first piece of advice
was uh, don’t try to do it alone. Like, much like a child riding a bike, much
how your dad or your mom would like hold you and then let you go, you need to
do that. You need to have someone to hold your hand and then like, you need to
like put weight on them as you-as you ride like a good like, twenty-or-so feet.
The second piece of advice was in order to brake, you need to just like, you
need to sit down. Like you just need to pretend to sit down. Or else you will like—it
will just not fuckin’ work. ‘Cause the first problem I was having was anytime I
tried to stop, I would just start accelerating and turning and it was so scary.

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: The, uh, like-like the way an electric unicycle works
is you learn forward to go fast and accelerate, like you put pressure on like,
the ball of your foot, and to stop you put it on your heels. But you have to,
you have to know how to distribute your body weight properly in order to do
that. So I don’t know what I was doing, I think I was trying to like,
push back on my heels and like—but then I was putting more pressure on the ball
of my feet too, because I didn’t want to fall off, like-I-like I think I was
trying to like, lift my toes, which would have like killed me, so it was just making
me go super fast and spinning in circles, and I almost ate shit a few times.

[Trog laughs]

Trog: Do you feel like you’re a more clownlike individual
after purchasing this unicycle?

Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeahhhh, that’s the real question.

Wayne: That’s the thing. I keep walking into it. I keep like-like,
I was just like joking around with my friends, I just said like, like in an
excited voice one day, I was just like, “I’m going to go ride my unicycle,”

[Baaulp and Log laugh]

Wayne: And there was like-someone was like, “Okay, Bozo,” like-fuckin’, [laughs] it was just—so now I’m kind of—

Trog: Wayne is becoming a clownlike individual, this is
all-look, it’s fine, you wanted to be a cl-you’ve told us you’ve always wanted
to be a clown, I’ve always been supportive—

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Gir: I know-we know you dropped out of clown college.

Trog: Buying this unicycle is the first step, I’m going to
get you a set of balloon animal balloons for your birthday—

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: Did someone like accidentally drop a bunch of fruit
like, on you and the-from like a higher elevation and then you just like instant-and
then you just instantly started juggling like a bunch of apples [laughs].

Wayne: [Laughs] Juggling it? I was-okay, I-I didn’t
catch on that that was where you were going with that and was like, what the
fuck are you talking about? I thought-I—No, I thought like, my-my-the first
thing I was thinking was like, “Is he going to make some sort of joke
about like, getting hit with fruit makes you a clown?” Like—

[Gir laughs]

Trog: Well, getting hit with fruit does make you a
clown, let’s be honest.

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Trog: All I’m saying is that, unicycle step one, balloon
animal step two, pulling infinite scarves out of your mouth step three.

Wayne: Hey, your hands are totally free on any unicycle, so
I could learn to juggle on it.

Baaulp: Well it’s a-it’s an electric unicycle so we keep
joking that you’ll be some type of cyber-clown.

Wayne: That’d be dope. So, but I’ve been-I’ve been givin’ in
to the clown jokes because it is funny, like, I’ll just say like, I’ve-I’ve
just said like-I-I-I was in the Discord the other day and I think I said
something along the lines I was like, “Guys, I think I’m addicted to this unicycle
and getting into small cars.” And like [laughs]—

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: It’s true. Wayne is becoming a clownlike individual.

Wayne: Alright, but the opposite effect is happening—

Log: I’m imagining like, a clown rolling in with a-with a-like
a squirt flower that fires that one like, high powered laser [laughs] instead
of water.

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: [Laughs] Like the fucking-like the fucking-like WEEDO
advertised one?

Log, laughing: Yeah.

[Wayne laughs]

Log: Just burns things into wood.

Wayne: Burns things very slowly, [laughs] like it’s just-like
I-like I-I squeeze my little flower and very slowly light you on fire, you have
to stand still.

Gir: [Crosstalk] James Bond type clown.

Wayne: [Laughs] Yeah. Um, but yeah, so the second piece of
advice was yes, sit down to brake, which worked amazingly, and the third piece of
advice was don’t just-don’t do it on like a street, do it in like a parking
lot, in an open area because like, much like a bike-like, if you-if you try-if
you try to just go straight and that’s your first objective, you’re gonna fail.
When you-when you feel like you’re going to fall just like on a bike, you have
to like turn into it. So I ended up like swervin’ around a little bit. And on
Sunday I was like, we-we were-it was a family trip so I asked my mom, “Can you
come out-can you-can you come with me to the uh—”

Trog: To the circus.

Wayne: “—to the parking lot and like help me practice?” And
she was like, “Sure.” She was like, “Sure,” and uh, so like I held onto her—I got
my gear on and I got in the parking lot, we-we-we went into the big top, and so
I—

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: [Laughs] We-we went to the parking lot, I grabbed her hand, and I started-and I like, I maybe had her hold my hand for five minutes
and I was just like, let go, and I don’t know what happened, I just got it. And I was just like doing everything. Like, everything felt possible, like going at the max speed, turning, braking, I could do every single part of it and it felt fuckin’ crazy because two days ago I was literally like—I felt like death just trying to stay on the thing.

Baaulp: You saw like a wire and you started going on that
and then someone—

Trog: Did you have a joy buzzer in your hand?

Baaulp: Yeah.

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: And then you went acr-and then you went across the wire
effortlessly, but then midway through someone tossed you like a giant metal rod—

Wayne: Mhmm. There was one time where I had a hard time
braking so I shot the handkerchiefs out of my mouth and used it to rope around
the light post to stop myself.

Trog: [Unintelligible].

Baaulp, laughing: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Wayne: The, um, but yeah no, and then uh, and then like I
tried it one more time the next day on my way home, we-we stopped at a big
parking lot and I was-I tried like-I tried some harder shit like going down and
uphill. Had some failures there, some success. Uh, the-and then I got home from
my trip yesterday and took it out on the street and then I just realized like,
I feel like my grasp on this is that of which people have described they get after
like, multiple weeks of riding it. Like I feel fully confident riding on it at
like full speeds, doing tight turns like without any gear, which is dangerous
and scary and I’m not doing—Don’t worry, people listening at home, don’t be
scared for me, I’m wearing gear when I’m s’posed to.

Wayne: The uh, but like, like last night I-I-I got in the Discord
call and I went for a joyride and I just rode around my neighborhood on like a
bunch of like cracked, like pothole-y roads and I could still-I could still
handle it. I’ve been… in love with this thing. I road it all day today, that’s
pretty much all I did, I was out there for maybe like three or four hours.

Baaulp: I think this is what people describe as flow. Like, like it is-it has a term—

Wayne: Mhmm.

Baaulp: It’s called flow when like, that feeling you get when like you’re trying to get something—I only know about it because of fighting games, but like—it is-it is the same here, it’s like yeah, it just clicks for you and you just get it. And you’re just in the zone and uh—

Wayne: Yeah, absolutely.

Baaulp: And the-and the reason why you picked it up in a few
days whereas some—uh, is because you’re not old, your mind is young and fresh.

Wayne: I guess so. The forum that I use uh, a large majority of its users are in their like, fifties and it’s funny. It’s like-like these people are not people I would be associating with and like-like-a lot like—there are a couple—there are a lot of like, you see electric unicycle YouTubers um, like some of my favorites like—one of my favorites is this probably like late
twenties early thirties guy from China, he’s really cool, he’s like amazing at it, he does insane shit that I don’t think I’ll be doing for like a long time. Uh, there’s like another-there’s another guy from New York who’s like probably
late twenties, uh, and then there’s-and then you just-it just procedurally goes
up. My next favorite YouTuber is like, this-this guy in his forties who’s like
a dad and his kids are in all of his videos, and then you go even further and
like the absolute like, enthusiasts who are like, ripping open their unicycles
and like, they know like about all the motherboards and shit, and all the
intense intricate shit, they’re like fifty and sixty and seventy. These old ass
men doing this shit.

Trog: There’s no way a seventy-year-old is riding an
electric unicycle. They would die.

Wayne: They could do it! They could do it. Like it-like it—I
think-I think like if you put your mind to it, and you like trust yourself, I think
anyone could do it. Genuinely.

Gir: If you can think it, you can do it.

Wayne: Yeah. You-yeah. Prepare to mutate! Prepare to mutate!
EUC! The [laughs]—

Baaulp: I’m not into this, but it does give me hope that I’ll
be able to play fighting games as an old man and then people-and then-and then
when I beat my grandkids with like the hardest Kazuya combos in Tekken 70 they
might get fed up and—

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: They get fed up and-they get fed up and hack my-hack
my life support.

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Tekken 70…

Trog: You’re going to the home!

Wayne: For Tekken 70—[laughs] Hack your life support!

[Baaulp laughs]

Gir: Extend my life with a life hack—See! A literal life hack!

Baaulp, laughing: It’s a life hack!

Wayne: They plug your keyboard into their brain like
Cyberpunk and they stare at you and they think, “Kill grandpa!” As they type in
the codes.

Gir, laughing: Gain six more months with this life hack!

Wayne: Hey, if Tekken 70 is going to come out in our
lifetime I think game sequels as a whole are going to be very different, huh?
Like that’s not gonna happen.

Baaulp: No, I-I just pulled a number out of my ass.

Wayne: I know, what the hell is Tekken 70 going to be like?

Trog: It’s a racing game.

Gir: You don’t know because all the characters that’re
replacing the ones you know now don’t exist.

Log: It’s a game of thought and action.

Baaulp: Yeah. Just like fighting games now—Heyyy!

Gir: Heyyy! [Unintelligible]

Wayne: The only classic Tekken character that’s left is Jack
70.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: All the others—it’s a-it’s a totally new cast, but
there is still Jack 70.

Trog: Jack 70, he’s here. Because he doesn’t age! He’s a
robot! They just keep making new ones!

Wayne: Bro, what the fuck—what would Jack 70 look like? For
reference, if you guys don’t know, uh listeners at home, what Jack is, there’s
a character that’s been in every Tekken game, his name is Jack, he’s a big
robot, he’s a big, white dude that’s a robot with like fucked up, crazy extend-o
arms and he’s been in every game but he gets-he gets a new revision. Jack, Jack
2, Jack 3, Jack 4, Jack 5, Jack 6, Jack 7. What is Jack 70? Like how do they keep—

Log: I think he’s gonna look like a nucleus with plasma
tendrils.

Baaulp, laughing: Yeah.

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: He’s a clownlike individual.

Wayne: They lose his visage of a racist man, he-he no longer
looks like a military guy, he’s like a fuckin’ monster.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: I have one last thing to say about the unicycle
before we move on.

Trog: [Crosstalk] Uh-huh uh-huh, talk-talk more about your
unicycle.

Wayne: Uh, well, I’ve been practicing-I’ve been practicing
the seltzer bottle bit while on the unicycle and I got like a good few
people with it.

Gir: [Crosstalk] Uh-huh, wow that’s a very crazy bit—

Trog: [Laughs]
Okay, hang on though, if you actually record a video of you riding on an
electric unicycle and spraying—and like drive-by spraying people with a seltzer
bottle, I will give you like, ten dollars.

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Wayne: Oh man. It’d have to be someone I know, though,
because I think-I think like, adding the unicycle in there makes that like,
scarier for strangers.

Trog: But that’s why it’s funny.

Wayne: Gir—I was talking to-like I was-I was in a call with Gir while I was on my joyride last night and like, Gir was saying like, “Yeah, you should bring like—” I feel like you said for some reason that, “—you should bring a bat.”

Trog: [Laughs] You should bring a bat?

Gir: Yeah-yeah, no ‘cause your-your gear makes you look like
a Cyberpunk like, hell man.

Wayne: I look like—No, genuinely, when I’m fully geared up, I look like a Hotline Miami character like, I look like-like if I had a bat I just would be. The-but yeah, I need to be careful because like, I did last night on
my—I want to talk about a few experiences that I’ve had about riding the thing. I-so I took it out on the roads for the first time last night, and within the first twenty minutes uh, I got stopped by a cop. Um, it happened almost immediately uh, the, and it was a very strange interaction. The like, chat—

Gir: Chat?

Wayne: I hate when I call them chat. Listeners at home—it’s different with a podcast! I’m-I’m never used to that. Listeners at home, as you know, ACAB, fuck cops, the—So like, pretty much when I interact with a cop I do my best to just get out of it as soon as possible, like I like, so when I was talking to him, he comes up to me and he’s like, “Hey buddy,” and I’m like, “Hey, how’s-how’s it goin’,” and he’s like, “What is that thing?” And I’m like, “It’s an electric unicycle.” And he says, “Shouldn’t you be riding that thing during the day?” And I’m like, “No, I got a headlight, I can see. There’s not that many cars out.” And he’s like, “Aight, don’t-try not to get hit by a car.”

Trog, laughing: Okay.

Gir, laughing: That’s a good trick.

Wayne: And I’m like, “O-okay, I’m gonna-I’ll try that.”
The-and then I-I ride away, I ride away and like, all the while, while that’s happening,
I’m in the Discord. I’m in our Discord server with like Gir, Baaulp, a few
other people, Scorpy, the-and like Scorpy the whole time is using our fucking YouTube
musicbot to play like, police siren noises in my ears—

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: —Which is like, stressing me out even more and I’m like, I drive away and the first thing I’m like—I drive away from the cop and the first thing I say is, “Scorpy, fuck you. Fuck you, man.” The-uh, I’m sure he got a laugh out of it. And then-so, yeah—I drive another forty feet away or somethin’ like that and then the cop turns around and comes back, and-and he’s like, “Hey, that thing’s pretty cool.” And I’m like, “Yep, that’s why I bought it.” And he said the dumbest thing, “It has brakes and everything.”

Trog: Yeah, yeah.

Wayne: And I’m like, “Yeah, man.”

Gir: Yeah, I can stop. [Unintellgible]

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: You can-you don’t die when you accelerate on this
thing.

Baaulp, laughing: Yeah?

Trog: He thought it was like the movie Speed where if you go
under a certain miles per hour it’ll just explode.

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: Dude, why isn’t that-why isn’t that Speed 2. I wanna
Keanu Reeves on an electric unicycle that’s going forty miles per hour, and if
it stops he blows up.

Gir: That doesn’t work though, ‘cause he would jump off of the
fuckin’ thing and just let it explode fifty feet down the street!

Trog: No, it follows you.

Baaulp: No! But then it blows up if you get off!

Gir: Yeah, but it’ll explode fifty darn feet down the street,
you’d jump off and you’d already be so far away from it!

Wayne: Bro, it’s like-bro, it’s like a bomb that could like
blow up a building, it would like, kill you still.

Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah.

Trog: [Crosstalk] Annihilate you.

Wayne: It doesn’t matter.

Gir: Uh, no, I would avoid it.

Wayne: I’d simply jump behind a barrel. I’d get behind a
tree. So, uh, yeah, the rest of—other than that-other than that encounter, the
rest of the joyride was like, super fun, and it was like a very cool vibe to
just be riding around my town around like-around like midnight with no one else
there just like, talking to my friends. Like, the motorcycle helmet does a very
good job of insulating like, the audio. Like, they heard me pretty well, I could
hear them perfectly.

Gir: And that’s where my point came in, was-here’s this
man-I had even brought this up—Imagine you’re walking down the street, it’s
like fucking midnight, you’re just out for a night walk, and someone comes
riding down the street right next to you, like right past you, dressed like a fucking
Hotline Miami character on a fucking electric unicycle, and all you can hear as
they pass by is like, mumbling about random shit.

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: I was like, “Man, nobody picks up these sticks, who’s
pick-someone-picks up these sticks on the sidewalk, we have no infrastructure,”
like—

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog, laughing: Just like a crazy person.

Wayne: Like-something-something like that or like-or like, “Man,
Kirby Air Ride music is awesome,” was like the other thing I was saying ‘cause
Gir was-I-Gir was like—

Gir: I kept playing Air Ride music.

Wayne: We-we were using the musicbot and I was like, “Yo,
like, put on some-put on some music,” first thing Scorpy does is he plays like,
the circu-the theme of the gladiators—

[Gir sings the beginning of Entry of the Gladiators]

Wayne: Fucking yeah, and I’m like, “No, you fucking bitch,
don’t do that.”

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: “Because I like it too much, and it’ll distract me.”

Wayne: I was toolin’ around—I keep, for some reason whenever
I’m talking about the unicycle I always say, “tooling around,” I don’t know why.

Trog: You’re turning into a fifty-year-old.

Wayne: The—

Trog: You’re aging.

Gir: It’s all these people—I don’t like your new friends you
hang out with.

Wayne: [Laughs] I was tooling around in the fuckin’-in the—

Log: I was knifin’ around.

Wayne: No, I don’t, I don’t have a single friend on that forum.
I have-I have-there’s nice people, but I wouldn’t call any of them my friends.
The uh, and yeah, I was toolin’ around in this parking lot and Gir put on—Gir was
like, “Yo, I’m gonna put on fuckin’ Kirby Air Ride City Trial music,” and I was
like, “Hell yeah,” fuckin’, I was ridin’ around listening to that shit, it was
awesome. And Gir was like, “I’m going to get you killed by playing this music.”

[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

Wayne: Which is-which is fine, I’m already skilled enough to
handle that thing at its top speed, which like-I have a—it’s called a Gotway Mten3, it is a-it’s the smallest electric unicycle. Um, it’s not like bottom tier, like there are some really shit old ones you can buy. It’s pretty decent, its top speed is like—I have the weaker version so it’s top speed is like maybe
a little over sixteen miles per hour, um, the—which on its own, when you’re just standing on like a platform, that real-that feels really fuckin’ fast. The wheels that I’m gonna get in the coming months can go like, thirty-five miles per hour which like, I am both scared and can’t wait to experience what the fuck that feels like.

Log: I think it’s irresponsible to have like, a clown tool that can go that fast.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: But then how do clowns get to work?

Wayne: [Laughs] Bro, you know how fast a clown car goes?

Log: They’re only allowed to drive that in the circus arena.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Yo, first-first-first WayneRadioTV electric unicycle
stream is I’m gonna-I’m gonna race four clowns in a clown car with my electric
unicycle [laughs] the—

Baaulp: That should be the next uh-uh what the fuck are
those movies called?

Log: Gremlins?

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne, laughing: Gremlins. That should be the next Gremlins
movie, man. A clown—

Gir: Don’t feed your clown after midnight.

Wayne: [Sighs] But yeah, that joyride was really cool, um,
and then today I took it out and the like-this thing I am ninety-nine percent certain
that I own the only one of these within like, a hundred mile radius. Because
the looks I’ve got, and like the amount of people who like, just point and me
and are like, “What the fuck is that?” It happened so many times that I took it
out today. I had some dude on a motorcycle like go out of his way to pull into the
parking lot I was in, drive up to me, and be like, [in a southern accent] “What
the hell is that?”

Gir, in a southern accent: What the hell is that thing?

Wayne: And I was like-and I was like-and I like, I yelled at him over the-the roar of the engine, “Electric unicycle!” “What?” “Electric unicycle!” And he’s like, “That’s pretty cool!” And I’m like, “Yep!”

Trog: That-That’s what they say now, but you’re going to get
into like a Frankenstein situation where people start getting scared of you and
they-they like they think that you’re a monster.

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: They’re going to chase you out of town with torches
and pitchforks.

Wayne: I was thinking like, if I keep doing late night
joyrides like, the cops are gonna know who I am. I am going to be like a
regularly seen figure and like, I wonder if I’m ever gonna get shit for it
eventually. The-like, I think it depends on if I ever get complaints or
something like that. ‘Cause I’m not-I’m not breaking any laws you fuckin’ cops!
Like—

Gir: No, but you look scary at night.

Wayne: I do look scary! I do look scary. I do-I look cool
too, but—

Trog: Which is why you need to dress up like a clown!

[Baaulp and Gir laugh]

Wayne: I would get so many more complaints if I was
riding around on that thing in clown gear.

Trog: I’m not talking about like half-ass clown gear, I’m
talking about full-ass parachute pants, giant shoes, curly wig, red nose, face
paint clown.

Wayne: I think if I rode my electric unicycle with clown
shoes I would die.

Trog: Then that’s your next step.

Wayne: I think that would get me killed. Like [laughs]—

Trog: You have to learn.

Wayne: That’s-that’s day forty shit. I’m on day five, leave
me alone. The uh-but like-I was walkin’ my dog, I walked past my neighbor who I’ve
never spoken to before, who like walked out on their porch and was like, “I saw
you on your scooter thing! That was pretty cool!” And I’m like, “Yo, thanks.”
Like I’m like, a little local celeb now.

[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

Wayne: It’s fuckin’-it’s fuckin’ hilarious. And-and today,
I-I have a really funny little story. There’s this one street that for whatever
reason, everyone who has a dog on it just does not fence in their dog, and
every single one of the dogs is a little troublemaker, like all of them. I’ve
seen so many just loose dogs on that street, and it’s so hard to get them to go
back to where they need to. But, I rode down that road this morning on my
electric unicycle, and I saw, just on the sidewalk, just walking down perfectly
fine on the sidewalk, was just this little Shih Tzu, totally unleashed, totally
unsupervised, and I was like, “Goddammit.” And I was like-and as I pull up,
there’s this thought in my head like, “Should I help it? Like should I go up? I
think I might know where this dog lives.” And as I drive closer, I’m like, “Wait
a minute, I am the sheep dog for this dog.” And I drive-I drive up to the dog,
and I literally start talking about it, like, “Hey! Where are you supposed to
be?” And this little Shih Tzu like looks up at me like, “What the fuck is that thing. That’s a man on a wheel.”

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: And like it-it like-it immediately like-it doesn’t
look like particularly like, terrified, but it immediately just looks at me like,
turns tail and y’know that little dog trot where they’re not like full-sprint
but they’re like, moving as fast as they can without exerting too much energy?
Like, just trotting as fast as possible and like, it like, I real-I remembered
where it probably lived and it was like running around in the front yard and I
just kept zigzagging back and forth going like, “You gotta go home! I’m not leavin’
till you go home!” And eventually it walked around to the backyard and I saw it
go up to the porch and presumably through their dog door. And I was like-I felt
so good I was like, “Yo, I just herded this dog! I was a shepherd today! I’m
doing good with this!”

Wayne: And then when I went to the parking lot later, the
same thing happened! Another dog got off its leash, except this was a much
scarier place ‘cause the parking lot was right next to a busy road. I didn’t
like, save that one myself but what I did was I was like, I went up to them and
was like, “Are you good?” And what I did was I like, I drove the unicycle like,
by the road and just kept going like up and down the road as like a wall and the dog didn’t approach me. So like, I am like-this like-weird, high tech dog rescuer, I’m a public servant now.

Log: Cyber-clown savior.

Trog: Hey, y’know, if the-if the streaming thing
never—y’know, doesn’t pan out then… you got an in.

Wayne, laughing: [Crosstalk] Cyber-clown savior.

Baaulp: Yeah, just uh, just never bring that to like Boston,
‘cause then you’ll be known as like, ‘the electric unicycle idiot,’ or
something.

Trog: [Laughs] The electric unicycle moron.

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: No matter what, it looks cool. The-the like, there’s
like-there’s a huge community of people riding these things in like, New York
City, I’m certain there’s a ton of people in Boston that ride them—No, I know
there are, I watch a guy who’s from Boston. The-I’m-you’ll probably see
someone one one day and like, it’ll probably be the kind of thing where like,
you’re only seeing it now that someone’s brought it up to you.

Gir: I will say, I live in a city that would have something like that probably more than a lot of other cities, never once in my life have I seen somebody riding one of them.

Wayne: I’ve never seen one either, and like, when I brought this up to my relatives who were up on our trip, like, before they even saw me get—before they even got to see me ride it, they were like, “Yeah we just saw a guy on one.” And I’m like, “No fuckin’ way!” I didn’t even know this thing existed until a month ago! I didn’t know this was a technology you could buy. 

Baaulp: I’ve seen people ride all sorts of things around the
city, and they always look uh, like they’re wasting their time.

Trog: Yeah, as opposed to Baaulp who just walks everywhere like a moron. Look at this walkin’ idiot.

Wayne: What does that mean? This is a vehicle—this-this is a
vehicle that is eco-friendly, that can take you speeds at which at like-like
cruising speeds that would be good for a city. Like, they’re amazing in city.

Baaulp: No, that’s just, uh—What, are you too good to walk?

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: Yeah, it’s cool. It’s fun as fuck!

Trog: Baaulp is calling people out. If you don’t walk
everywhere, Baaulp thinks you’re just a dumb idiot.

[Baaulp makes a sound of agreement]

Wayne: The next steps on my electric unicycle journey, I
gotta-I gotta-I gotta learn—I gotta practice driving on like slightly busier
roads. Like tomorrow I’m thinking I’m gonna try to go get coffee on it, um, the
uh, which’ll be a lotta fun. I gotta learn how to ride backwards, um, y’know,
like that’s necessary for juggling.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Yes, very important.

Wayne: Yeah, that’s so-that so far, I have fallen off this thing, but I always end up stumbling. I’ve never landed on my ass or like my—I wear a ton of gear but I’ve like yet to actually hurt myself. Uh, usually what happens is like I’ll jump off and the wheel will take a bigger hit than me. But that little thing, it’s a trooper. It has taken so much damage and it’s like, perfectly fine. It’s all cosmetic damage. Um, the uh, and then uh, the like final frontier is like, jumping. I mean if you-if you modify them by—

Trog: [Crosstalk] How do you jump?

Wayne: —So the-like—What you do is—They call ‘em Kuji Pads,
‘cause there’s a guy on YouTube called Kuji Rolls who like, invented them,
essentially. What they are is like-they’re a-they’re like a thick layer of
neoprene padding that you put on the wheel, right above like—not-not above your
toes but like the center of your foot, right above that, and what it does is
like—it lets you get a grip on the wheel that you wouldn’t otherwise have. So
like, you grip it, you-you ju—you buckle your knees and you jump and you grab
that pad and you go up in the air and you take the wheel with you. If you jump
off of it like, without a modded wheel, you will just go up and your wheel will
keep going without you, and you will eat shit and your wheel will explode.

Gir, laughing: Yeah, and you’ll die.

Wayne: But like, when you-when you do that, it is such a
neat skill to have because it means that like, if you want to like transition
from riding in the bike lane to riding on the sidewalk, you don’t have to stop
and like, lift up the wheel, which is like what I would have to do now unless
there’s a ramp, which is what I’ve been using for the most part. Um, but like,
they’re doing crazy shit. The videos in which he describes how to jump he’s like
jumping over like small manmade moats—It’s like crazy how much distance they’re
getting. And the final thing that I will never, ever do is riding down stairs.
That’s horrifying and I will be fine not partaking.

Gir: Yeah that’s like asking for your neck to be broken.

Wayne: Yeah, the—I’ve never seen anyone fall doing it, but
that’s ‘cause the people who do it are experts, but that’s just like—No, I’ll
just-I’ll just stop and go down the stairs. I think I’m good.

Gir: Yeah, I was going to say, to round out this-this… vehicle
talk, I will say one last addition before we move onto the questions. I’ve been
thinking about just getting like-like a Razor. Like a regular ass, basic,
non-motorized Razor scooter just to facilitate—

Trog: Hell yeah.

Gir: —going down to the corner store, ‘cause for the next
two months I can’t renew my license. 

Trog: Now is a Razor scooter—‘Cause whenever I think about using
a scooter, it’s not really efficient in terms of like—

Wayne: It’s not even remotely efficient.

Trog: —force exerted to like distance traveled I feel like
is worse than just about any option.

Gir: No, distance traveled here is… the distance I’m talking
about is far enough that walking sucks, but not so far that it would be more exhausting
to use it.

Trog: May I make a suggestion?

Gir: No.

Wayne: My electric unicycle kick like, this-this-this thing
that I’m doing, part of the reason why I’m doing it is because I’ve always had
this desire to know how to rollerblade, but rollerblades fuck me up more than
this electric unicycle thing even though the electric unicycle is technically way
more dangerous. I—There’s-there’s a video I saw a while back that like-that put
this bug in my brain like, “Man, one day you need to get really good at
rollerblading,” where it was like, someone rollerblading to literal Jet Set
Radio music and they jump on a fucking rail and start grinding and I was like, “Holy
shit! That would be so cool to be like, a master at that.” But like, I hate the
idea of not being able to just like, get rid of the wheels off your feet and
just start walking, like, if you’re on a rollerblade and like, something goes wrong,
your only option is to eat shit. You can’t just like, save yourself.

Gir: And that-that’s what I was gonna bring up. My—The route-the
path that I would be taking is exclusively next to a busy road with a sidewalk
that is barely wider than I am. So, uh, eating shit in that situation would be
uh, lethal. 

Trog: Now—

Gir: A scooter reduces that immensely, even more than if I
were to have a skateboard.

Trog: Now may I make a-now may I make an observation? Uh—

Gir: Sure.

Trog, cracking up: I think you—the visual of you riding a
child’s Razor scooter down to the corner store as a full grown adult next to a
busy street—

Wayne, laughing: [Crosstalk] I can see—yeah—

Trog: —is probably the funniest thing I’ve thought of in the
last hour and a half of recording.

Wayne: I don’t know if-I don’t know if they make unmotorized
Razor scooters—

Trog, laughing: [Crosstalk] For adults.

Wayne: That like-that like are—Yeah, I don’t think they make
those for adults.

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: I think you can only get an electric scooter. Which
like-why not an electric scooter?

Gir: Those’re expensive.

Wayne: Like that-those are-those are cool.

Trog: Oh, Razor scooters for Tyler who’s like in eighth grade!

[Wayne laughs]

Gir: Tyler won’t let me borrow his!

[Trog and Wayne laugh]

Baaulp: They’re-they’re expensive because they’re adult sized,
Gir.

Gir: No, they’re not.

Trog: That is true.

Wayne: Mhmm.

Gir: They’re the exact same size I work with a guy who had
one! It’s the exact same size…

Trog: [Crosstalk] I am all for Gir purchasing a child’s scooter
and riding it to the corner store.

Gir: Whatever!

Wayne: I will-honestly, I’m gonna-I’m gonna shill the EUCs
like, for the rest of my life to you guys, probably. Like, you probably-you—Here’s
the thing, here’s the thing. Like, let’s say I end up-we end up all moving to a
place where we’re pretty close together, I’ll have that thing, you’ll be able
to see it, and I will want some of you to try it, because it is like—

Gir: I’m on Razor’s website right now, and here’s-they
filter—They filter ages—

[Wayne laughs]

Gir: Kids five to seven, and then they have eight through
twelve—

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne, laughing: Perfect!

Gir: —And then one specifically labeled teens and adults. 

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: Uh-huh.

Gir: Alright?

Trog: Like I said, I am all for this excursion, I think you
should do it.

Gir: I’ll get one with the big wheels uh, so I can put—I can
attach a cart on it so it sounds like it has a motor.

Trog: Oh, yeah. [Laughs] That’ll be so much fun.

[Gir laughs]

Trog: Can we all pick just like, a weird fucked up mode of
transportation and-and all decide like, Wayne can have-Wayne can have his
electric unicycle—

Wayne: [Crosstalk] We have the funniest gang.

Trog: —Gir can have a Razor scooter, I want to ride two
hoverboards at the same time, but not one on each foot, I want one for my feet
and one for my hands.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: So I’m like on all fours riding these two fuckin’—I’m
like a dog on wheels.

Wayne: You are asking like—the injury you’re gonna get there
is like, you’re gonna lose your balls, man. Like, you’re gonna like, fall and
like it’s gonna stretch you out and you’re gonna land balls first on the ground—

Baaulp: I want-I want to be like that guy from Twisted Metal
where I’m between two giant tires [laughs]—

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Yes! Bro, no, for real. If there was a community like
the EUC community but for being Axel or whatever his name was from fuckin’
Twisted Metal, I would-I’d be on that. I’d would be on that.

Trog: [Unintelligible crosstalk]

Log: Um, I just had like a genius idea that I can’t execute ‘cause
I’m not an engineer. Uh, electric pole vault.

Gir, laughing: How—what? 

Trog: What is that? How does that work?

Wayne: How? Wha—Explain.

Log: Alright, Okay, so like inste—So you know pole? Um, at
one end you have a little wedge kind of thing with a motor in it, right? So you-you
wedge that end into something, you activate the motor and it pole vaults for
you.

Gir: That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.

Wayne: But—Okay, okay, so how is that-how is that a method
of transportation beyond just a single jump? Like, can you-would you be able to
continue?

Log: [Crosstalk] You can continue-you can continue and just
replace it.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Gir, laughing: This is the dumbest thing!

Wayne: Hold on, re-describe this to me. I need to—

Baaulp: You’re basically just pole vaulting like, over and
over again!

Log: Yeah, and that’s kind of—but imagine this, like, you
can go—If it’s-if it’s an electric pole vault then you can pole vault up.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: You can pole vault up without electricity, though,
like the pole vault is used for the…

Wayne: The first thing you do is go up!

Gir: You’ve essentially described something that’s as-as equally
like, pointless as electric stilts. 

Trog: Electric stilts would be pretty fucking sick, though.
I would totally use electric stilts.

Log: We were-we were asked to describe fucked up means of
transportation, so, I-I don’t—

Gir: Well it-it still has to transport you, though! [Laughs]

Log: It takes you from one place to another, and I think it’s
fucked up. So, I think-I think that you should-you should perish.

[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

Wayne: I feel like the-the visual-the visual of this gang of people is like, you—Like, my-my thing is like weird, but it is-but it’s very practical. I would be just like, speeding up way ahead of you guys then turning back and seeing like, Gir like pushing off the ground, Trog on the ground like, eating gravel as he like rumbles down the road, like, oh man.

[Gir laughs]

Trog: [Crosstalk] I don’t think I’m describing mine good
enough.

Log: Hey, we’re basically creating the vehicles for a Mario
Party battle mini-game.

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: Yeah, we’re like the coolest RPG team, like we-like we
are the RPG characters. We all have our own thing.

Baaulp: Also, I’m a little insulted because Axel would be way faster than your electric unicycle, the only—

Wayne: Actually, that’s true. No, you’d have the-you’d have
the speed of a car, is the thing, like—

Baaulp: The only drawback is if I make any mistakes the wheels keep going and my hands get ripped off.

[Baaulp, Gir, and Trog laugh]

Wayne: Yeah, the thing is that like, there’s-there’s that
downside, and also I believe there’s the-the other downside that I believe that
character in lore is described as in excruciating pain at all times because
that is a torture device.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Well, that’s the price you gotta pay. I wanna change
mine from the double hoverboard—I have posted an image in the chat, the-the people
listening to this can’t see this, so I’m going to try and describe this—Imagine
if your body was a giant rollerblade, just covered in wheels from top to bottom,
that’s what I want to be. I just want to be able to like, start running and
fall down and it doesn’t matter how I fall because there will be wheels
underneath me that keep me going.

Wayne: Oh, yeah! I see what-like, that’s a legit thing, though.
Like what is that?

Gir: That actually is pretty cool.

Trog: I don’t know.

Wayne: What do they call that?

Baaulp: There’s like a rollerblade suit.

Trog: Yeah. I want to be the rollerblade suit guy, but I want it to be motorized so I just like, I’m like a-I’m like a fuckin’ Transformer—

Wayne: That’d be dope.

Trog: —I curl up and roll out.

Wayne: That’s something that like, in a Fast and Furious
movie, Vin Diesel would be attacked by when he doesn’t have his car. 

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Yeah, there’s like a group-there’s like a squad of
these dudes that have like, miniguns on their backs.

[Wayne laughs]

Gir: Y’know, I thought about it more-I’ve sat and thought
about it, I think electric stilts would be more like pneumatic stilts, where you
can like change your height at will.

Trog: That’d be cool. I’d be down.

Gir: That actually would be pretty practical, yeah. It’s
like, “Oh, I gotta get over this really tall fence, let me just shrink one leg
and extend the other, step right over.”

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: I’ve always wanted to try those like-like we saw a
bunch of like, cosplayers using these when we went to PAX East, they’re like pogo
stick stilts that like—

Gir: [Crosstalk] Yeah. Yeah, those are [unintelligible].

Wayne: —have like the bend of an animal’s hindlegs, like-those
things look fun. Those things look like—I would love to try those. They seem
like, not like—they’re thick, they’re not like stilts which are literally just
like sticks, they look like they’re actually like, pretty feasible to get on
and like, maneuver yourself around and bounce around.

Gir: They’re what some prosthetics are—are just those.

Trog: Yeah. I am looking at Amazon for jumping stilts right
now, I think this is gonna be my new thing that I get into, is these fucking
jumping stilts.

Wayne: No, no, if we-if we are-if we are rolling around, if
we’re rolling around the streets of Texas I’m on my EUC, you’re on your stilts,
Gir’s on his Razor scooter—

Trog: The thing is these stilts don’t make you fast, I would
be slower on these, like this would be like—this is essentially me like, riding
a pogo stick while you’re on a-like, in a vehicle.

[Wayne laughs]

Gir: Can I say I chose this-this mode of transportation to
get me like, five hundred feet away from my house. I’m not about to roll around
town on this fuckin’ thing.

Trog: You should get a pogo stick. God, pogo sticks are
expensive!

Wayne: Lame, lame!

Trog: This pogo stick is a hundred and fifty dollars! And it’s
only for fourteen-year olds!

Baaulp: Sloane asks, “Podcast question—What are each of your
favorite videos on YouTube that have under one thousand views? Love, Sloane.”

Trog: Hmmm…

Wayne: Y’know, my memory’s horrible, but I’m gonna go look in my playlist that is specifically for stuff like this. 

Baaulp: Yeah. Uh, new favorite-new favorite, Buff dog. Um, that’s
a new-yeah, that’s a new one.

Trog: [Laughs] Buff dog.

Baaulp: It’s just a—this like, ten second video of this buff Pitbull. 

Wayne: Does that have less than a thousand views?

Baaulp: Uh, let me check. 

Wayne: You gotta-you gotta meet that criteria, man.

Baaulp: For—At the time of this recording, four hundred and
eighty-two views. It is a buff dog, and it has some like, bass boosted Old MacDonald
like, Old MacDonald like, music over it.

Trog: Old MacDonald music, also known as the song, Old MacDonald.

[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

Gir: This is a hard one, ‘cause most of my favorite videos that
were under a thousand like, got popular after-after the fact. So.

Trog: Yeah, y’know, I was looking for one, and I was like, “Oh,
I know exactly which one I’d pick,” but Green Goblin Sound Effects has like,
four thousand views.

Gir: Yeah, okay, that was I was gonna say, is like, my pick-my
pick and, we’re going to have to ignore that criteria because a lot of the time
these things just go over, but—

Baaulp: Yeah.

Gir: —my pick, three-point-five thousand views after nine
years, ‘Ice Cube – “It Was a Good Day” [HD] *extended version*.’

Trog: That’s a pretty good one.

Wayne: Guys. Guess what video has under a thousand views. ‘zozo go bo ba bo ba.’

Trog: No, I don’t-that video doesn’t exist, you are making
it up.

Wayne: It’s fuckin’ real! I’m lo-I’m lookin’ at it!

Trog: No, it’s not.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: I don’t know what you’re looking at, it’s not a real
video.

Wayne: Look! “Make a zombie go boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.”

Trog: [Sighs] You can only watch that video like, a hundred
more times and then it no longer qualifies for this category.

Wayne: [Laughs] I know, it’s about to slip out.

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: Ahhhh, you know what-a video that just slipped out of
the ‘under one thousand views,’ chat, is uh, “I stay committed while you
motherfuckers babysittin’,” that one has over a thousand views, so that doesn’t
fall under the category here.

Trog: 'vxcv' has like, seven-seven thousand views, like, I can’t
believe that 'vxcv' has [laughs] seven thousand views.

Wayne: Yeah. 'vxcv'’s famous.

Log: Yeah, I’m-I’m really surprised 'this video don't wach' has like, seven thousand.

Trog: No way. Really? All those people wachin’!

Wayne: That might be because of us.

Log: Yeah, maybe [laughs].

Trog: It’s probably because of us, nobody else knew that fucking
video existed before we brought it up.

Gir: See, we do this to ourselves! Because I feel like we find
videos that are like that, but then we show other people and ruin it!

Trog: Yeah, hey, this sounds like a-this sounds like
entrapment, you’re trying to get us to say these so you can go watch ‘em and
put ‘em out of the category.

Gir: Yeah!

Wayne: It won’t r-it doesn’t ruin them, though!

Trog: No, it doesn’t ruin them, I’m just sayin’.

Wayne: Unless it becomes some big meme and it’s blown out of
proportion, it’s fine. Like, how about around a thousand. Like, just-just
like a very low view—

Log: I actually have a couple of killers that are low view—well,
two specifically.

Wayne: Killers.

Log: ‘Alien Rap,’ and ‘Sad Song Featuring Ging Gungus.’

Baaulp, laughing: Oh, yeah!

Gir, singing: “My dog died!”

Wayne: Wait is-is Alien Rap the one that’s like-the one that’s
like, “Evoke the dark arts, the man is heap-sauce,” that one?

Log: No, I can’t-I don’t-I don’t even know how to find that,
Alien Rap is like the negative—the video of the kid in negative like whisper
rapping with uh, like, a generic rock riff playing over it.

Trog: Oh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Wayne: So the one that I was thinking about, I actually have reuploaded on one of my channels somewhere, where it was like a rap someone made where the lyrics were just like, fucking bizarre, I-the-the-the lyrics were like, “Spaceman, evasive action, you better watch out, they’re comin’ for ‘ya, they got a lot of fraction,” And like, but the-the final-the final line-the final bar is, “Mastered the Dark Arts, the man is heap-sauce.” I’ll never forget that last one.

Gir: I have to revise my answer because the closest thing a
thousand, at 1.4K, and Holly will back me up on this, is ‘Vegeta loves
a hot sauce feet.’

Trog: Oh, god.

Gir: That fucking cracks me up so fuckin’ bad.

Wayne: Wait, what is that? That sounds familiar.

Gir: It’s just like-like footage of Vegeta with like that
fucked up weird fetish audio in the background, like, “Oh, yeah, hot sauce on
these fuckin’ southern feet.”

[Wayne and Gir laugh]

Gir: And it gets me and Holly every fuckin’ time.

Baaulp: Oh damn, Zabz has like, hundred thousand views, well
shit.

Wayne: Yeah, that video has some significance that we don’t
understand.

Baaulp: It’s not for us.

Wayne: Actually no, maybe it-all the-all the comments are… I-I
don’t know. ‘Cause some of the comments are just a million emojis, which is pretty
typical of something like that.

Trog: ‘MyZaza’ has eleven thousand views. Even ‘MyZaza’ isn’t safe.

Log: There’s one I can think of that, um, did have around a
thousand views at one point but, due to our meddling, shot way, way above that.
It’s uh, ‘Banjo Gyro!.’

Trog: ‘Banjo Gyro!’ was fuckin’ nothing before we found it. 

Log: Kevin—Yeah, Kevin, one of the moderators in the
Discord, uh, Kevin-Kevin typed ‘Gyro’ into YouTube and found a—like a-like
a-just a CGI animation like, short film, called ‘Banjo Gyro!’, it’s the-like,
most absurd shit I’ve ever seen.

Wayne: It’s amazing. It’s incredible. It’s so-it is fuckin’
awesome, and like, I feel like it has influenced us in a lot of ways over the
years—The amazing aesthetic, just some of the-some of the most memorable,
iconic—I feel like I can remember like-I think my favorite part of ‘Banjo
Gyro’—sound design.

Baaulp: Yes, yes.

Wayne: Like I feel like I can remember every weird little synth
noise like-like—[Wayne makes a sound similar to a meow, followed by a low, repetitive noise]. Like, whenever someone moves, it’s not footsteps, it’s like synth bubbling and like, just—It’s so good. Every-every single noise sounds like it could be used for like an alien abducting you, like, it’s—Ahhh, it’s so good.

[Trog laughs]

Log: Yeah, it’s fantastic. So that has a couple hundred
thousand views now, but it’s still fantastic, so check it out.

Wayne: We-we found it aro—Yeah, we found it around like-I
don’t even think it had like a hundred views when he found it, and like we-we
found it, and we shared it around a little bit, and it got a little boost, and
then from there it got shared around a little bit. Back then when we found it,
none of us were even remotely popular. Yeah, it was-it was like around—yeah.

Trog: We were all children.

Gir: Basically.

Trog: Practically.

Wayne: Real quick, I thought of one last one, and I’ve shown it on like movie nights and shit, it’s one of my favorite videos. It’s literally titled, ‘MOV 3974 MOV’ like .mov, and it’s a video of like, some dude in his car like, saying like, “Yo, we drove out here, the middle of nowhere, you better give us all—you better give us your money or this baby gets it!” And he’s in his car with like his dog, wearing like a ski mask, and he just pulls out like a little plastic figure of a-of a fetus it’s just—I can’t describe the video I’d have to-I’d have to link it to you. We should probably gather links for these videos so we can like, put them in the description so
people can watch them.

Trog: This is a question from Gwimble, who says, “What is
the absolute hardest a joke you’ve made flopped, either in its terribleness or
its overall effort-to-enjoyment ratio? On the flipside, what’s the lowest
effort joke you’ve done that’s gotten the biggest reaction?”

Gir: I want to come out right—

Wayne: [Crosstalk] That’s a good question.

Gir: Come swingin’ right outta the gates here, uh, in recent
memory, the worst—I don’t even remember what the joke was, it was that bad, but
then uh, Wayne like let out—It was when you let out like the most pathetic
like, fake laugh, and I was like, “That wasn’t-that wasn’t funny, you didn’t
have to laugh.”

Wayne: Yeah, I don’t even remember what he said, it was-it
was so just like-it was so pr—It was just the kind of thing that like, he
didn’t even put like, much thought into, he just kind of said it—

Gir: It was just something I said in passing, and then you
were like, “Hahaha.”

Wayne: Just kind of a passing like, punny kind of joke, and
like, and I was—I think I was playing Fall Guys and I heard that and I was
like, in my head I was like, “Well, that sucks,” and I was like—I wasn’t gonna
laugh or anything, but for some reason I was so focused on the game I just went
like, “Ha…haha…” I just made like-the most like antagonistic, pathetic laugh,
and Gir was like, “Eh, you know you didn’t have to laugh.” Like it was just
[laughs].

[Trog laughs]

Baaulp: Ah, geez.

Gir: And conversely, the lowest effort thing that got-that
got a lot of laughter was when we were in Texas and it was like me, Wayne, Log,
and Lauren in the car, and I just pointed at somebody and was like, “Hey, we
should run that guy over [laughs].” 

Wayne: No, you said—You pointed at him and said, “We should
kill that guy.” Just like—

[Trog laughs]

Gir: Yeah, I was like, “We should just kill that guy.”

Wayne: It was [laughs] I don’t even think we were in a car,
we were just walking around and you said that and—

Gir: No, we were in the car! We were in the car! That’s why
the first thing I said was run him over!

Wayne: That’s probably why not everyone knows it, because we
were split into two groups at the time.

Baaulp: Yeah, I missed that on that.

Gir: But you guys like fuckin’ lost it and I was like, “Why?
I just said we should kill a guy, that’s all.”

Wayne: Ahh, this is a hard one for me.

Baaulp: I can’t remember the last time I fell flat with a
high effort joke, I try—My brain probably blocks that shit out.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Traumatizing. 

Baaulp: Man, I-I’ve gotten to the point where I’m such good
friends with you all I know all the-I know all the low effort buttons I can-I
can push.

Wayne: Yeah.

Baaulp: The low—Like, uh, this isn’t—

Wayne: Oh, [claps] I have your answer.

Baaulp: You have my answer, what is it?

Wayne: The—For-for-for Baaulp’s low effort joke that got the biggest reaction, there was like, I cannot remember for the life of me what the conversation was about, but I was there, Mira was there, maybe a few other people were there, but Mira and I remember this very vividly, and we were having some conversation about like, playgrounds or something like that, and Baaulp just said, in the stupidest voice, it just came out of nowhere and made no fuckin’ sense relative to what we were talking about—

Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Oh, yeah.

Wayne: Baaulp just said, like, “Hey, I’ve got some uh,
important monkey bars, here.” 

Gir, laughing: [Crosstalk] I forgot about that! 

Wayne: And like, it made Mira and I laugh so hard we almost
passed out. We were like, crying, like it was-I don’t—The fucked up thing is
like, to everyone listening, everyone’s just like, “What are you—Why?” Like,
and I could not tell you. Like it was just—just a ‘you had to be there’ kind of
thing—

Gir: [Crosstalk] In the moment, yeah.

Wayne: It was in the moment, I don’t even remember the
context, but I will never forget it. It was just so dumb and out
of nowhere, it killed us.

Gir: I-I very vividly remember Mira gasping for air.

Trog: I can’t think of it, I-I feel like it’s almost like a
fear of mine, where it’s like, I feel like—‘Cause I was thinking of this
question in terms of like, stream stuff that we’ve done?

Wayne: Yeah, I mean, for the high effort stuff that
definitely would be where that would come up into play.

Trog: Maybe I’m gonna jinx us here, we’re gonna have a real stinker here in the future, but it’s like, I feel like everything that we’ve put like, a lot of effort into, I can’t really think of anything that’s like, flopped. Like nothing, nothing that’s flopped like hard, where it’s like, “Oh, nobody thought that this was funny.”

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Yeah—

Baaulp: Well I mean, the thing is like, we usually have a
good grasp on it, like, we don’t just throw shit out there, we usually run it
by with each other, and that means that if it isn’t funny it never gets in. 

Trog: I suppose.

Baaulp: Like, we’re pretty good about that.

Trog: I can think of like, technical fuck ups that have
happened, but nothing that’s like, been—

Wayne: Usually that makes things funnier.

Trog: Yeah, that’s true.

Wayne: I’m like, trying to think of like, earlier streams
like, I feel like pre-Gub Gar I didn’t do a whole lot of like, crazy stuff
like, on-with my Twitch channel.

Trog: [Crosstalk] Well, Gub Gar was the first like, big stream that I can think of.

Wayne: That was-that was like, six months in, and it was
like the first like big, higher concept joke that I did. The uh—

Trog: Culmination of an ARG.

Wayne: I’m trying to think if there’s anything—I feel like, like
I’ve had more things happen that are like higher effort that don’t get a lot of
attention, less so than like, things like hitting—

Trog:  Right, yeah.

Wayne: ‘Cause like-like some things I look-I look upon very
fondly, like G-33 Babel Initiative, which is a stream where I got a gorilla
costume—

Trog: Oh, yeah.

Wayne: And we set up an-we set up an OBS scene where Trog
and Baaulp were behind glass and were scientists examining a gorilla playing
video games. It was a pretty weird concept that was a little hard to pull off,
I think it was pretty funny, but it was-it was like—it definitely was not as
well executed as it could have been because like, I don’t think I gave a very
clear idea to Trog and Baaulp as to what I wanted you guys to do, so like—

Trog: Yeah. You know what, legitimately, I forgot about that stream, so I think that’s my answer. Like, that-that stream it wasn’t like a flop-flop, but it was like—It’s literally like out of all the—

Wayne: [Crosstalk] It had some very funny moments.

Trog: —out of all the bit streams that we did, that’s the
only one I literally didn’t remember being a part of until Wayne just brought it
up. It has to be my answer.

Wayne: [Laughs] I thought that one like, it was good, it
probably could have been workshopped more, like we probably coulda put more
time like—

Trog: I think you’re right. Me and Baaulp just didn’t really
have a lot of direction, you had an idea of like, “Alright, we’re gonna have me
in a gorilla costume, playing like, fucking Apex Legend,” and I was like,
“That’s kind of funny in concept, but what am I supposed to do?” And it’s like,
“Oh, I don’t know, just like talk about it.” Like, “Alright.”

Gir: Oh yeah, I was a part of that, too.

Log: Oh, yeah.

Wayne: No, you weren’t. 

Gir: Yeah, I was!

[Wayne laughs hard]

Wayne: No, you weren’t! How were you a part of it? Oh wait
no, you and-you and-you—Log, I forgot about Log and—See, I’m forgetting things
too. Log and Gir played Apex Legends with me as the gorilla, which I also
thought was a pretty funny idea.

Gir: Literally the only time in my life I’ve played Apex
Legends.

Wayne: So, I had a pretty clear idea in my head of like, what I wanted it to be, and like I had this idea in my head of how Trog and Baaulp were gonna act, but like, I didn’t want to be too directive, so I didn’t say anything and then like, and then it just ended up like, I was just sittin’ there slappin’ the controller and they were just like, “What do we, like, what do we say about this.”

Trog: Yeah, it’s like, we definitely needed more stage
direction, I was like, “I’m not sure what direction I need to take this in.”

Wayne: I should have been a little bit more-a little bit
more commanding with that. But it had-it had some-some very fun- funny moments
like, such as like, the controller kept unplugging, and like there were a lot
of good funny moments with like, you guys talking about me like, “Oh, he-he
unplugged the fucking controller again, he keeps unplugging the USB,” The uh-the
like, the funniest thing that happened—

Trog: Pulley system with a banana, I remember that.

Wayne: Oh, yeah! That was like, I-that was like the one-one
other gag I had in mind which was like, I fastened a hook to my ceiling, which
is still there, I’m looking at it right now, and I tied a banana around a very
fine, like—

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: —surprisingly sharp thread, and like-and like hooked
it up like, to a—

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: I’m sorry, but with-with this app I can hear every
little noise Baaulp makes, and I—Apparently Baaulp like, charges his laughs,
like—

[Trog laughs]

Baaulp: Yeah, I do.

Wayne: [Laughs] Like, you-it might not come through the
final recording, but like, when I-when I know something is funny to Baaulp,
this is not something I hear in person or in Discord, this mic here is just
more sensitive—I just hear him go like, [Wayne imitates a slide whistle going
up in tone]—

Trog, laughing: He’s charging it, dude!

[Log laughs]

Wayne, laughing: He’s just like getting ready to laugh!

Trog: He’s chargin’ it!

Wayne: [Laughs] And it totally ruined me. So like, yeah, I
tied a banana to a thread, and I hooked it to my ceiling, and I like, fastened
the hook on a heavy object, and like, at some point during the stream I was
like, “Alright, I want you guys to give me like positive reinforcement, like,
drop a banana into my cell,” and like, at some point they did that, and like, I
was the only one, I’m only the-the only one at my place for like physical help
ever, so when you said that, I had to like stick my leg off camera and like,
kick the book so the banana fell and like [laughs] and the banana—It’s crazy
how quickly a banana gets gross—

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: —once it’s like, open. Like, ‘cause by tying the
thread, it squeezed the banana and caused an opening, so the banana that was
perfectly fine like, the hour or two before the joke actually happened, when I
set it up, came down a gnarly, and black, and disgusting.

Trog: Ew.

[Baaulp makes sounds of disgust while Log laughs]

Trog: Yeah, alright. That’s definitely the answer.

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Like, it was bad. It was fuckin’ bad, and
I think like--

Trog: And I legitimately forgot I was—that that even happened. Like, gave me a brain blast.

Wayne: [Laughs] It’s on the vods channel, if you’re hearing
this and you’re curious, it’s still a good watch even if it was kind of messy.
The funniest thing that happened in the stream though, was uh, I was using a DS4
controller hooked up to my computer, for some reason, back—I don’t know if this
is still a thing, but back then the native input when you press the PS button
on a DS4 controller, it commands media programs. For whatever reason, if you
start-if you have like a MP3 player open or something like that, it will-it’ll
start playing a sound. And for that stream, I-I had foobar open, which is my
media player of choice, it’s very bare bones, very simple, but I didn’t have my
music open, I had my sound effects tab open, and at the time I was doing—I had
previously done a joke involving Sora in Kingdom Hearts 2, so I accidentally hit
the PS button and we’re doing this bit, and all of a sudden you just hear Sora
go, “[Inhale] Donald! Goofy! Hyah! Neuh! Fire!” 

Gir: [Crosstalk] “Aladdin!”

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Like, “Aladdin!” [Laughs] And I’m like, I like-my
jaw, in the gorilla costume, just dropped and I started laughing so hard I was
crying and we had this like, and you guys-I don’t think you guys could hear it—

Trog: No, we couldn’t.

Wayne: So like, all of a sudden-all of a sudden I’m just
like, sobbing and we had this signal where if I put my hands on my head that
means you need to cut to break because I couldn’t talk, because I was a
gorilla, and like, they’re like, “I think the monkey’s crying.” Like it was
just—

[Log and Baaulp laugh]

Wayne: It was such a good moment.

Trog: It was so weird, yeah, because neither me nor Baaulp
had stream audio, so we didn’t know what the fuck—so we just like, didn’t react
to this bizarre scenario that just happened because we had no context.

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Trog: We-we-we—That was some sloppy production on our part,
we-we’ve cleaned it up since then.

Gir: [Crosstalk] Learned from growing pains.

Baaulp: That was the early days. 

Wayne: That was also like, I was still—I’m always figuring
out the kinks in my fucked up greenscreen set up, and like, that one—

Trog: [Crosstalk] Oh, yeah, that shit’s [unintelligible].

Gir: [Crosstalk] Oh, you fucked it up every single time.

Wayne: I had it like—there-there was like, I was sitting on
the floor, so that’s extra prone to fuck ups. I had the green screen like—there
was a nail in my wall that like a painting used to be hung on, I had the
greenscreen like, pushed into that and then clothesline clipped onto that, it
was the worst set up. I’ve now figured out that I literally just use duct tape
and I tape it to the ceiling, that’s more effective. But, the fuckin’ like—I
would just like sit wrong and all of a sudden the greenscreen would fall and
you would just see this pile of boxes in the corner of my room and you guys
were just like, “The gorilla has opened up a hole in the void.”

Trog: “There’s been a-a breach.” It’s funny in hindsight.
During the actual performance, it probably could have been funnier. But it’s
funny to think about how fucked up it was.

Wayne: Yeah.

Log: I don’t know like, all of my-all of my high effort
stuff is just uh, Gather Ye Power.

Gir: Hard to tell if any of the jokes land or not in that
sense.

Wayne: Yeah, you don’t get that immediate feedback, but I
think your humor in that lands. There’s definitely some stuff that genuinely made
me laugh out loud.

Log: And I mean like, it’s not like I have that big of a
viewership in the first place, so if anybody goes out of their way to talk about
anything in that, that’s like-that’s like shocking.

Wayne: I think a joke—I just want to compliment you, I think
a joke in Gather Ye Power that still sticks with me-I might be—I might be
miswording it, but it was like, one of your side characters saying, “I’ll make you wish the circus was never born!” Or something like that.

Log: That was the main character. That was Cube himself.

Wayne: Cube said that? Yeah, well, I remember the line, not
who said it.

Log: [Laughs] So, that-that one was good, I felt good about
that one, but one that I was like, for whatever reason I thought, “People will
like this one a lot,” because I like this one a lot, um, I had just like a
guardsman just standing in front of a-of like a cart with-filled with bags of
money, and he was counting, so he was counting like, “Nineteen, twenty,
twenty-one, those are my three favorite numbers. And there’s twelve bags of
money in the cart.”

Gir: Okay, yeah, I remember that gag. That’s a-that was a
good one.

Log: I thought, “Oh, that’s perfect.” But yeah, nobody
really said anything about that one, so I don’t know.

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: What you’re gonna have to learn is that the subtle
stuff always goes past people’s heads.

Wayne: But it like-even if it doesn’t make people like laugh
out loud and be like, ‘ah, that part was so funny,’ like, if it’s subtle it
adds to like-it’s just-it’s this procedural like-you’re just stacking up,
you’re gaining this long term charm like, that people will look back on and be like,
‘yeah, it’s a very charming comic,’ even if certain things didn’t get the gut
busts goin’.

Log: Perhaps, I don’t think anything has been like a flop,
though.

Trog: That’s what I’m saying, that’s where my anxieties lie.
I feel like we’re overdue.

Baaulp: Naaaah, naaaaah.

Wayne: Oh well. We’d recover. I’ve had flop streams, but
that’s not the same, like—

Log: I think the best return on investment was playing as
Joni in your um, AI Adventure Call.

Wayne: Ahh, that was great. Yeah, that was like—

Log: I didn’t have to try very hard at all for that one
[laughs].

Wayne: You knew-you knew exactly what you were doing, and we
gave you the right prompt. The fuckin’ sheep shearing quest.

Log: The stars aligned for that one, it was perfect.

Baaulp: This question is from Wowwywowwow, they ask, and-and
like, the first half I can just answer, ‘cause this-I already know the answer,
but there’s an interesting second half that we can kind of expand on. “Did any
of you have any theatrical training prior to becoming streamers/before getting
into Twitch? If so, are there any fun theatre games you wish were-uh, you wish
were possible to practice at the moment?” So, the answer is no, I-I don’t like—

Wayne: Theatre games? What’s a theatre game? [Laughs] I’m
not a theatre kid.

Baaulp: Kind of like games that you would… kind of play with
other performers to like, get in the mood of like, doing improv or like acting.
I—Do any of us have theatre experience? The answer is no, right?

Log: I did theatre in high school.

Gir: I-I was gonna say, Log and Holly did.

Trog: I was in theatre in middle school.

Baaulp: Yeah, but like, for me, no, I don’t think Wayne—Like, Wayne,
did you have any?

Wayne: I have never done anything like that. And-and that’s the thing, getting into this, getting into streaming, like, that side of things was not something that I ever thought I was gonna evoke, I’ve never considered myself in the past to be like, a good actor, and never thought that was something that I was gonna like pursue. But then as it went on, that ended up being a huge part of it, and like, and it turns out we’re all pretty g—okay at it. Like, I wouldn’t say we’re all like amazing actors or anything, but
like—

Baaulp: I think to expand on that quest—that second half of
that question, like are there any games that you play, like—

Gir: I can answer that one, because I never got into theatre
‘cause I was too shy of a kid back then, but because of all the Whose Line I
watched, there were so many things that they would do on Whose Line that I wish
that I had friends would do that with me.

Baaulp: I mean, here’s the thing—

Wayne: That’d be fun.

Baaulp: We do kind of do it-like, what I was gonna say was,
we do kind of do our own version of that, where like-like yeah, we don’t do
theatre, but when it comes to comedy like, aren’t we just like—as a group of
friends, aren’t we just always trying to make each other fuckin’ laugh, though?
Like—

Wayne: It’s improv without it being like, forced and
annoying, because it’s just like, what we do. The like—

Baaulp: We are like the evil Shaolin—we are like the evil
Shaolin monk, lotus temple monastery of comedy, like—

Gir, laughing: What?

Trog: [Unintelligible] 

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: We are always tryin’ to make each other laugh, it is
always on sight, like, there’s no-no rules it’s like, “Oh, I’mma-I’mma
try-I’mma try to make them laugh today.”

Wayne: “Oh, Wayne just got stopped by the cops? Let me play
policesiren.mp3 in the group chat.”

[Trog and Gir laugh]

Baaulp: Yeah!

Trog: That’s hilarious.

Wayne: Like the fuckin’-it is-it is literally nonstop
twenty-four seven, anytime we are with each other that’s what’s happening.

Gir: I guess that’s true, ‘cause like when you would be
driving home from work and I would play the fuckin audio clip I designed of you
being like, “Oh, my name is Wayne, oh shit!” And then a car crash—

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: “OH SHIT!” Yeah, the fuckin’—and like, it really, it
is the equivalent of like, Shaolin monks of the temple like, making their
children like, hang from tree branches by their toes and like, and how the
adults developing iron egg skill like, just constantly like putting themselves
through these fucking trials and tribulations. 

[Trog laughs]

Baaulp: Like, we don’t play any like, explicit like—we don’t
do any routines, but like, we-we-we know how to make each other laugh, and
we’re good at like being very snappy because like, we are just constantly,
like, every—even the people who aren’t usually like, appear on streams, we are
constantly just trying to make each other laugh, it’s like, kind of, it’s
uni—it’s special. Let me—I think so.

Gir: I would like to sit us down one day and do a handful of
things like that, like-like one of the like-uhh, I’m trying to think of the
name of it, where it’s like-like where everybody says one word to form a
sentence, and you go back and forth between like two people.

Trog: Oh, god. Just real theatre class shit.

Wayne: We did that. I mean, that actually—I always thought
that was fun, but like, we did that, there’s a JackBox game that was just that,
Word Spud, like in the first JackBox game, and it was very fun.

Log: I’m thinkin’, I just think back to the type of games
that we would play whenever we’re doin’ um, basically any production in high
school. And really like, all that stuff was just to um, help you get into sync
with other people and uh, break the ice, I guess. But it’s just not really
necessary for this group, I’d say.

Gir: Yeah no, icebreaker ones, no. ‘Cause we’re already—the
ice-there’s no ice to be broken.

Wayne: I already know these people like a book I’ve read a
thousand times.

Trog: It’s really the fact that any time we do any of the
like, big production things, or even the smaller stuff, just anything that’s
like a concept, we don’t write. Like, we don’t-we just don’t. We-we are not in
the habit of writing anything down, basically.

Wayne: I think-I think-I think another thing that like, I
like about us when I said that we were like, okay at acting, like we ended up
being okay at that, I feel like the fact that we’re not perfect adds to it a
lot, because we all—something that we all as a group think is very funny, fuck
ups.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: When things go wrong, it’s fucking hilarious. And
like, and like that can be a technical difficulty, or it can just be someone
like saying something wrong, or just like not knowing what to say, like we
thrive on each other’s like, failure.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: But I’m saying that in the-in the-in the fact that
it’s like-like we don’t do improv games, we just like… technically like, almost
any concept stream we do is improv just by the fact of like, well we’re not
gonna take the time to write down jokes beforehand, we’re just gonna come up
with them on the spot. That is just technically improv.

Wayne: Mhmm. You forge it-you forge them in fire like, it’s
funnier, like than if you pre-write it.

Baaulp: Well we do do—what the plan that we do use is that
we usually give ourselves a good jumping-we give ourselves a good, yeah, jumping
off point to like, facilitate it, and we just kind of like, hit the ground running.

Trog: Like for instance with the GameClam thing like, we-we
like—Scorpy wrote up, ‘cause he directed that one, Scorpy like, had a Google
Docs that just had an outline of like, “Alright, Wayne’s gonna talk about this, then we’re gonna play these videos, then Wayne’s gonna talk about this,” and we talked about jokes, like the day of beforehand, but we didn’t like, wr—like nobody was ever reading off of a script or anything like that.

Wayne: The one script in AI-dventure Call that I had was
like, I prewrote the little limerick I said at the intro ‘cause I can’t come up
with something like that on the spot, and if I do it’ll be like really bad
[laughs].

Gir: And you know what, there was one time Scorpy made
something where Wayne was reading a script and Wayne fucking up was added into
the final product [unintelligible].

Trog: Oh yeah, that’s right. That doesn’t really count, Gir,
that wasn’t a stream, that was for a project.

Gir: No, that was—but you know what I’m sayin’.

Wayne: Yeah, Scorpy’s projects are pre-written but that’s a
totally different thing, like—

Gir: Scorpy’s the only one of us that will write things.
Like, at all.

Baaulp: That really says that like, “Hey, here’s a
pre-written thing,” and he added a fuck up to it, and it made it so much better
[laughs].

Gir: Yeah, [unintelligible].

Wayne: Yeah.

Baaulp: You don’t need to break the ice if you are—have already
been friends for more than a decade.

Wayne: So I have a-I have another question real
quick. This one’s an easy one, well, it’s not so much an easy one as it’s like,
more on the jokey side, but it got me thinking as soon as I read it.
Jimmiefingers in our Discord asks, “How do you feel about ‘Best-By’ dates on
food?” And I read that and I was like, I mean it’s important, right? 

Gir: [Unintelligible].

Trog: [Crosstalk] Mhmm.

Wayne: But they make me mad. They make me mad because like,
if-if I have food that is past the best-by date, like, I will sit there and like,
just fucking like introspect for like, three minutes, staring at the food,
smelling it, inspecting it, and just being like, “[Sharp inhale] I—can I—I don’t—Can
I eat this? Like, it’s like two days past the thing,” like it just, it annoys
me. I wish there was like a better way.

Gir: You have to have some logic about it. There’s certain
things that you would know after a while.

Wayne: Yeah.

Gir: Like if it’s-if a date on there says that it expires at that time, for certain things, yeah, immediately just fucking get rid of it. Other things, that thing’s probably still good for another month.

Wayne: It-it makes-it makes me mad sometimes with like meat,
like-like lunch meat. Like sometimes it’ll be-it’ll be like past the expiration
date, but like, it like smells fine—Like-like the give-the give with meat
sometimes is not the smell, but it’s like, if there’s like slime. Like if
you—

Gir: [Crosstalk] The texture, if it’s slimy. Yeah, ‘cause lunch meat
I feel like always smells like farts regardless, so.

Wayne: The thing is is like, the slime test fucks me up, because
sometimes lunch meat is slimy from the start. Not like super slimy, but like a little
bit slippery, like it’s just a little bit wet. Like if you buy deli cut like,
cold cuts, you get some of that. There’s a-there’s a point where it’s obvious,
there’s a point where it’s obvious and you need to throw it away. If it’s like congealed,
you need to just fuckin’ get rid of that shit.

Trog: I think I take the opposite approach as you, Wayne, in which I find the best-by date a comforting reminder of like, I-I get anxious when it’s before the best-by day, but like close, and then like once it hits the best-by date I’m like, “Alright, cool, it’s done.” I-I take this as law, so that I don’t have to have that moral conundrum of like, “Should I throw this out?” It’s like, “Oh, it’s past the date? It doesn’t matter I’m not gonna
check I’m just gonna throw it away.” It’s-it’s out of my hands, Father Time has taken this pack of ham from me.

Wayne: I mean, does that motivate you? Does that motivate
you to be less wasteful and not buy food that you’re not gonna eat?

Trog: Oh, hell no.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: What the fuck, man? You gotta be better. 

Trog: No, it makes me feel worse actually, ‘cause then I-I’m
like, I check my fridge it’s like, “Ah shit, I gotta throw all this shit away,
I didn’t-I didn’t eat this—Why did I think it was a good idea to buy three
cartons of eggs? When was I ever gonna eat this?”

Baaulp: Three cartons of eggs? Damn.

Wayne: You go to the grocery store and it’s like, “Oh yeah,
I’ll need all this stuff, and I’ll make so many cool meals,” but then it just comes
around to it and it didn’t happen, and then you just have—

Trog: [Crosstalk] And it just doesn’t happen, and then you go order burritos again.

Gir: Yeah, that’s every time I buy food. I will buy like, so
much shit-I’ll buy so much shit and then like, an hour after I’ve put it away I
forgot that I just got it.

Wayne: It happens to me especially, like, ‘cause I still don’t
have my own place, I’m barred by the pandemic from having one at the moment,
like-where like I’ll buy things to make my own dinner, and like, then like the days
where I want to make it, like someone else is using the kitchen and I like, don’t—

Gir: Yeah!

Wayne: There’s nothing more that I hate than trying to use
the kitchen at the same time as someone else.

Gir: That’s exactly why I rarely cook for myself, is I’m in
the exact same situation, it’s like, “Oh, today I wanna make like that jambalaya,
yeah,” I’ll go out there and every-like all the dishes are dirty already, there’s
somebody out there already making something, it’s like, “Oh, I guess I’ll uh,
guess I’m eating ramen.”

Wayne: Can’t wait to have my own kitchen. Oh, you know I’m gonna do the craziest shit in there. 

Log: The problem I have is I’ll get something, I’ll put in
the freezer, I’ll determine, “Okay, today’s the day that I’m gonna use this,”
so the day—the night before I take it out of the freezer, put it in the fridge.
And then, that day I take it out and it’s still frozen. 

Gir: You gotta put it in warm water.

Trog: You gotta put it in two days in advance.

Log: It’s just a-it’s a load of shit. They-they tell you to
do one thing, but the-their way—there’s a universal way to unfreeze it and they
always tell you otherwise.

[Gir laughs]

Log: It’s shit, it’s just stupid. 

Gir: Somethin’ about that just tickled me so bad. Just Log
being mad that meat didn’t unfreeze and calling it a load of shit [laughs].

Log: Yeah, they always tell you to thaw it out in the
fridge, but thawin’ it out in the fridge takes so long. It takes too long.

Trog: Yeah, I hate thawing food, that shit’s sucks.

Log: Like whatever. Just take it out and just put it on the
counter four hours before, and then it’s good.

Gir: No, like if you get something—

Log: But I try to play by the rules—

Gir: Put it in warm-a warm bowl of water.

[Log sputters]

Gir: Not hot, but warm.

Log: I don’t have a good bowl for this.

Trog: Keep it in your mouth.

Gir: Do you have a sink?

Log: …I’m not gonna put it in the sink.

Gir: Oh my god, then don’t complain.

Log: I’m—[sighs] what do you think I’m gonna do? Just put it
in-just at the bottom of the sink?

Gir: Yes! You plug the sink, set the meat in there, put in
some water, and let it thaw!

Log: Gross.

Gir: Oh my god [laughs]! There’s nothin’ wrong with that!

Wayne: Nothin’ wrong with that! That’s what you gotta do!

Log: I know my way around it, and I come through at the end.

[Gir laughs]

Baaulp: I think we’re—I-we’re talking about defrosting meat
now, I-I-this shit’s over, this shit’s over!

Trog: Yeah, I think maybe it’s—I think it’s time to fucking
mercy kill this goddamn podcast already.

[Wayne laughs]

Log: Whatever. You-make your-make your decision.

Wayne: Have we talked about, uh-I just got this new fruit
wash.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: Come on, man.

Wayne: I spray the fruit and it gets all the pesticides off.
I… I’ve been separating the darks from the brights in my washer.

Gir, muttering: Nobody does that anymore.

Trog: Let’s do an outro where we each say one word at a
time.

Wayne: Let’s go me, Gir, Trog, Log, Baaulp. Okay? Alright.

Wayne: Thanks.

Gir, simultaneously: Bye.

[A pause of silence]

[Everyone laughs]

Gir: [Unintelligible] 

Trog: Ah shit, that’s good, but we can’t-we have to-we have
to do our plugs.

Wayne: That was good, but, yeah, let’s do the plugs and then
we’ll do this. Okay, so anyways, y’know, it’s been three months and the question,
it never stops arising, we don’t know where to begin these podcasts, but we
always know how to end ‘em. This uh, if you want to ask us a question for the
next Where Do We Begin podcast, you can either join the WayneRadioTV Discord,
that’s discord.gg/wayneradiotv, I believe we have that link now, um, the uh, or
you can email us at wheredowebeginqa@gmail.com Uh, and we will take your question
and we might read it. There’s a lot of them these days, but—

Baaulp: Yeah. And we pick the best, most interesting ones. 

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Mhmm. Like best-by date questions.

Trog: It’s a fuckin’ brown bag. 

Wayne: Uh, if you wanna see more of what we’re doing outside
of the podcast, the uh, we have an entire Twitch Team. You can find me twitch.tv/wayneradiotv,
the uh, that’s where a lot of the bigger productions go on we talked about,
like the AI-dventure Call stream and the-the gorilla stream.

Trog: [Crosstalk] Great gorilla stream.

Wayne: But everybody doin’ somethin’! Gir, what’re you doing
these days?

Gir: Uh, everywhere you can find me just by searching MasterGir.
Twitch, Twitter, YouTube, like all of it.

Baaulp: Same thing for me, except it’s Baaulp, B-A-A-U-L-P,
I just put out a new video last week, the second episode of my talk show. Uh, maybe
I’ll get a real talk show one day, but until then I have make on in my living
room. Uh, yeah, I also have started streaming on Twitch pretty regularly,
Tuesdays through Fridays, and uh, yeah, more content, follow me on social media
for weird funny stuff.

Trog: I have a Twitch channel as well, uh, it is
twitch.tv/Tr0g because Trog was already taken, so I-I had to do a zero. Maybe
someday I can get the URL.

Wayne: It’s a damn shame. Give Trog his name!

Trog: Yeah I don’t know, I don’t know how many viewers or
subscribers I need to steal somebody else’s name, but let’s try to get me there.

Wayne: Maybe I can get enough to do it for you, like to get
it [laughs].

Trog: And then I’m also on Twitter, and that’s Trogort,
T-R-O-G-O-R-T, it’s like a little palindrome. Um, yeah, I-I stream, we all
stream, everybody streams nowadays. Sometimes video games, sometimes crosswords.

Wayne: I think it’s twitch.tv/team—is it-it’s either team or
teams--/wrtv, you can see the entirety of the RadioTVSolutions team. All nine
of us, including Moupi.

Trog: [Crosstalk] It is, yes.

Wayne: Uh, but anyways, how about we do our little thing?

Trog: [Crosstalk] What about Log? Log didn’t get to go, bitch.

Gir: [Crosstalk] Yeah, [unintelligible] Log, You do that every time!

Wayne: Oh wait, fuck! [Screams]

Log: Observe Logmore on Twitch and LogBlaster on Twitter! There are many mysteries to be found! One way or another you’ll find out about Gather Ye Power and how to reach it, it’s pretty easy to get to it. You can
figure it out.

Trog: Wow, great plug.

Log: Use your hints. You can—There’s-there’s multiple paths
you can take that come to this ending.

Wayne: Type promocode GatherYePower into Google.

Trog: Go to Kellogg’s.com and start from there.

Gir: To get an exclusive—

Wayne: Get an exclusive coupon to read Gather Ye Power for
free.

Gir: NFL.com, it’s cool. Check it out.

Wayne: Alright. 

Gir: Guys.

Wayne: Thanks.

Trog: For.

Log: Party.

Baaulp: Time.

Wayne: It.

Gir: What?

Trog: [Laughs] Yeah.

Log: It [laughs].

Gir: Oh, you said ‘it’? All I heard on my end was, “Eh.” …Alright,
say-say it again. Say it.

Wayne: Okay. So it was-it was, “Thanks guys for the party
time?” It was, “Thanks guys for party time,” It—

Gir: Was.

Trog: Never.

Log: Party.

Baaulp: Time.

[Gir laughs]

Trog: [Laughs] Maybe improv games are fun.

Wayne: However.

Gir: Alright. However, uh, say you have to say-you have to
start it again ‘cause—

Wayne: However.

Gir: We.

Trog: Haven’t.

Log: Partied.

Baaulp, laughing: Time.

Log: I did past tense there, Baaulp.

Trog: Not grammatically correct.

Log: I did past tense there.

Baaulp: Times? Timed?

[Log, Trog, and Wayne laugh]

Gir: Will.

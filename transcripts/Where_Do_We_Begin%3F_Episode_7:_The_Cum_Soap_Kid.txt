[Intro music “Wild Winds of Home” by Yin Xia plays, then fades at 0:27]

Wayne: [exhales] Where do we begin? I'm Wayne.

Trog: I'm Trog

Log: I'm Log

Gir: I'm, Master Gir

Baaulp: I'm Baaulp.

Log: We had a lot funnier of an intro last time, but Baaulp complained so we restarted.

Trog: Yeah

Wayne: It was much better, and Baaulp was, I don't know, he's just- I think we're gonna have to ditch him

Trog: If you donate, a hundred million dollars-

Baaulp: To me.

Trog: We'll give you access to the secret compartment where we keep all of the failed podcast intros.

Wayne: Many of you have never seen Baaulp's actual, true beautiful visage, but I want you to pi- visualize it in your head right now, and the first thing I want you to visualize is visible stink lines-

Baaulp: A circle

Wayne: Visible stink lines.

Log: Yeah

Trog: And a circle

Log: It's like he's surrounded by noodles, but they're the worst kind.

Wayne: It's ridiculous, and he's- and- and- and imagine there's a speech bub- 

Baaulp: Okay-

Wanye: There's a speech bubble and it says "I want to restart this recording, this wasn't good"

Baaulp: Okay, okay, this is just slander now, and I will sue

Wayne: I'm- I'm about to- I'm about to slap some more of it on there. You want the real slop?

Baaulp: Uhh...

Trog: I could go all night

Baaulp: I'm calling my lawyer right now

Wayne: You want the real slop?

Log: Yeeess, slander some of it on there buddy!

Baaulp: Hello? H-hello? Uhh- Texas Hammer? I'm- I'm getting slandered, please help, please beat up- 

Wayne: That's not- 

Baaulp: Please beat up my friends.

Wayne: That's not fair, that's not fair I didn't think he was gonna call the Hammer

Trog: That's also not what lawyers do.

[Gir and Wayne laugh]

Wayne: You're making fun of me? I'm calling my attorney!

Log: Lucky for us, we have the Texas Hammer's son, who is also the Texas Hammer.

Trog: It's true

Log: I believe we've talked about this, in, uh

Wayne: Dual-wielding hammers

Log: Way back in the day, the prologue episode did have discussion about it

Baaulp: That's why I brought it up. One thing I just thought about: Mirror Match. What if both sides get father and son to go up against each other?

Wayne: Who's on the other side? Wha- I don't have a father and son lawyer, I don't have a Hammer-

Baaulp: No! No

Wayne: There's no Connecticut Hammer

Baaulp: No, there's two Hammers, one's the son of the other, like what if one person hired one Hammer and the other person hired the Junior Hammer

Wayne: Oohhh, I don't think they would do that, I don't think they'd agree to that, that seems, like, bad for business

Baaulp: That's good for business! Either way they win.

Log: There is an assumption here that one of the Hammers is, like a prosecutor, and the other's a defense...  [Wayne giggles] -attorney. But I'm pretty sure they are both exactly the same, they are like- uuhh, they're like Ryu and Ken. The younger Texas Hammer has flames whenever he points at the- defendant. That's- that's it.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Have you ever used the Hammer? 

Log: Uh, no

Trog: I've used a hammer.

Wayne: [crosstalk] I swear to god, it's- it's gotta be a front for like a hitman service.

Trog: With a name like that.

Wayne: Absolutely! They're killing people with hammers!

Gir: Is Ryu an ambulance chaser?

Trog: Yes.

Baaulp, laughing: Yeah

Trog: Absolutely

Log: How do you think Ken got all his money? 

[Everyone else laughs, Baaulp laughs longest]

Gir: You know, I mean- now that you mention it.

Wayne, laughing: Oh man, Ken Masters insurance fraud.

Trog: Alright, bit complete! We're done, that bit's, we did it-

Baaulp: Oh no

Trog: We reached that beat- that bit to it's logical conclusion, now we can move on

Log: Oww!! My Shin! Ryuken!

[Laughter]

Gir: Shut the fuck up.

[Log makes fake grunt noises]

Wayne: You s- you suck at it! You suck. I don't approve...

Gir, laughing: You suck- You suck at it...

Trog: So, it's been a while since we recorded our last episode-

Wayne: Two months!

Trog: Which, technically makes this one our post E3 wrap up episode, uhh, nothing happened!

Baaulp: The end!

Wayne: It's been a year since we started podcasting!

Trog: Has it really?

Wayne: Yeah, cause Do You Like Games, we did the E3 episode.

Trog: That's true. Y'know, part of me regrets a little bit not doing a Do You Like Games episo- err, that's what it's called, right? That- that's what that podcast was called? 

Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah, that's what that podcast was called that we haven't recorded in a year

Trog: Ok, just making sure. Uhh, I kinda regret not doing another one of those for another E3 funny prediction thing, but the thing is that, E3 is just so boring this year I feel like-

Wayne: We wouldn't have had anything to work with

Trog: We wouldn't have even had anything to like, make fun of. It- it was such just a nothing, like, nothing

Wayne: You know what's cool? You know what gives me a safe feeling, is that, that's our idea, we can do that whenever. [Baaulp nodding and saying yeah] We haven't recorded in a year, it's not going anywhere. It's coming back baby! Calling it now, Twenty-sometime! You'res getting another episode

Trog: Whenever something funny enough happens.

Gir, laughing: Twenty-sometime, sometime in the next- hundred years! Watch out for it.

Baaulp: Mm hmm

Wayne: Yeah, there's uh- we got uh- we- How long until the first one of us dies? Probably 70 years, 70 years, sometime- it's coming.

Trog: Well I plan on living to 120, so-

Wayne: Aww...

Baaulp: I'll either be the first to die or the last to die.

Wayne: That's how I feel too, honestly

Trog: Pretty ominous Baaulp, I'm uh- I'm not a fan of that.

Wayne: I won't die, is my plan.

Trog: That- hey, that was mine.

Wayne: [crosstalk] If Trog wants to live to 120, I choose not to die.

Log: We'll figure it out sometime, we'll get a cyborg into here.... That'll accomplish something. 

Wayne: If we get the option to become cyborgs, and it's like, not that scary or dystopian, would you guys do it? Would you guys put technology in your body?

Trog: Hmm...

Gir: Hell yeah!

Trog: Yeah, probably

Gir: I'd lob my own fucking head off, and put it on a robot. I don't give a fuck

Trog: I mean, that's my backup plan if I can't figure out how to make a genie in a lab before 2022. 

[Baaulp laughs]

Gir: That's not your own fault.

Log: I don't know, can I really trust a fellow software developer?

Trog: You know, that's a good point

Wayne: [crosstalk] Develop your own internal implants! Make your own brain chips

Log: Can I really trust myself to make a good program for my brain? No.

Wayne: Of course you can! 

Trog: Look, I don't even like learning C. I'm not gonna... I'm not gonna learn, bio-mechanical engineering.

Wayne: Now what extent, would you guys put chips in your brain, or would you be more into like body mods, like arms and legs and like, organs and shit, but robotics.

Trog: I feel like it really depends on what it does for me.

Gir: The whole kit and kaboodle.

Wayne: Uh, brain chip that makes you never drop a combo in a fighting game, would you do it?

Trog: Is the surgery invasive?

Wayne: Of course.

Trog: Then no.

Gir: They strive to invade.

Trog: [crosstalk] It's not worth it.

Wayne: They just like, jam it in there, with their hand. 

[Trog and Gir laugh]

Baaulp: Well, would you rather have that, or would you rather get gene therapy to give you a six pack and make it so that your brain is just good enough to not drop combos ever?

Trog: Yeah, I'll- give me that. That sounds cooler.

Wayne: Hmmm.

Log: I think I'd really only want cyborg alternatives to something that I didn't have. Like, if I lost something, sure, slap a robot thing on there, but I don't really feel like going out there and replacing it off, just off the cuff, y'know?

Wayne: You know that GIF where that chick's hands, I think it's like an anime or cartoon, that chick's hands like explode into like, forty six prongs and they start typing on a keyboard? Give me that.

Baaulp: I'm pretty sure that's from Ghost in the Shell.

Trog: But how would you- like, what would you use that for? What are you gonna type?

Baaulp: To type fast.

Wayne: I'm- I'll become a fucking essay writer, at that point. I'll be an author, a playwright. A scholar.

Trog: But it doesn't make you better at writing the plays or coming up with ideas-

Wayne: Oh, I know! 

Trog: It just makes you faster!

Wayne: The thing is, the books are all gonna suck and the plays are gonna be total shit, but I'll get- I'll get them done so quickly.

Baaulp: You're gonna- so- so your tactic isn't to be a good writer, your tactic is just to like, shotgun it, like...

Wayne: I'm taking like, the monkeys on the typewriter approach, but it's just like one man on a typewriter with the efficiency of like, 10 monkeys.

[Baaulp laughs]

Log: Yeah-

Gir: I don't think that's very efficient.

Log: Optimize the keyboard, and just like section it off into four quadrants, make books for each quadrant, you're limited to those letters and numbers.

[Baaulp laughs more]

Wayne: Here's the thing, Gir, it's efficient, it's not effective. It's efficient in that I'm putting out all the plays, and putting out all the books that I want.

Baaulp: Alright real quick, what's your- what's your first one about? What's your first book about?

Wayne: Uhh, it's about- it's about a dog with a couple extra legs who can go really fast and there's a- there's a league of dog racers, and there's- but there's a second- there's a B-plot about like gambling? And then it turns into like a mafia drama, and then it's revealed that every- there's like a secret, uh, like hidden human power, uhh, and they have to train it and develop it.

Log: Okay, but you can only use keys 1 through G, so you have to spell dog D-A-W-G, okay?

[Laughter]

Wayne: Okay.

Trog: What's your second play?

Baaulp: Yeah what's your second play?

Trog: [crosstalk] There's one! One of the books, it's in the can!

Wayne: Well that was the book. Well that was the book. Uh, my first play- my first play is like an absurdist play about a guy who wakes up with a knob in the back of his head? His name's uh, Jeremy Applecorn? Um-

Log: Even with fucking, multiple finger- multiple mechanical fingers, you still plagiarize.

Wayne: I- [laughs]

Gir: I wanna write a Spongebob musical

Wayne: Hey man. Hey! He- those books aren't published yet, I can plagiarize an unpublished book, that's the law!

Trog: I'm not sure that's how it works.

Baaulp: [laughing, crosstalk] Wai- wait- what is he plagiarizing? What- what is this?

Wayne: Jeremy Applecorn, or whatever the fuck. That- 

Baaulp: What?

Wayne: That 4chan story of the guy who's like "oh I reference my own unpublished literature all the time"

Baaulp: Ooohhh, okay, okay.

Gir: Berrycone, or something

Wayne: He specifically said it was an absurdist novella about a man who wakes up with a mysterious knob on the back of his head. What do you think that was about, beyond that? Like, what did the knob do? What was the story of Jer- of, fucking Gregory Applecorn?

Gir: You'll have to...

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Who the fuck knows.

Log: It lets him play Left 4 Dead 2.

Trog: You ever read Kafka? 

Wayne: No, actually.

Gir: Shut up, nerd.

Trog: Well it's like that. 

Wayne: Well, okay. I'm not an intellectual so you're gonna have to dumb that down. Is it like the Joker? Like, is it-

[Baaulp and Gir laugh]

Trog: Yeah. It's just like the Joker.

Wayne: Dude, the Killing- Aw, the Killing Joke

Baaulp, laughing: [crosstalk] Ohh nooo... aw noo! Ah- the Killing Jo- yeah, that's what he's known for!

Log: In Batman, does the Joker ever use fake bugs as a weapon? Because I feel that's part of the whole, clown mystique.

Gir: Uuhhh... I don't-

Wayne, in Joker voice: Batman will perish when he sees these fake spiders I put in his bed! 

Gir, Joker: Look at these bugs, Batman! They're not real!

Wayne: Die!

Gir: Die, fucker!

Trog: We can't just devolve into more impressions.

Gir: Yes!

Trog: I won't allow it.

Wayne: While he's distracted by these fake spiders, I'll shoot him in the back of the head!

Trog: Yeah, Joker should really just use a gun.

Gir, normal: He does!

Wayne: Joker's Trick!! [makes gun noise]

Baaulp: He- well, well here's the thing. Joker has a gun, but it's like a fake prop toy gun, that like-

Trog: Right

Gir: No-

Baaulp: When he shoots it, a little flag comes out and goes "Bang!"

Gir: He has a real gun. He used it, he shot whatever-her-name was. 

Wayne, normal: Everybody thinks that one scene from the cartoon is real sad, where like Robin shoots the Joker, or something like that. I don't know.

Gir: Oh yeah, he shot the Joker-

Wayne: [crosstalk] He gives Robin a real gun.

Gir: And he said "bang!" and he goes "haha!"

Wayne: He goes "That's not funny." 

Gir, dying joker: That's not funny...

Baaulp: You know what's funny? If I- If I died. I'm the Jokeerrrr

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: Let's reenact some more cartoon scenes

Trog: Nooo, please.

Gir: [crosstalk] Let's- let's move on.

Wayne: Oh no, I mean- I've got- I've got, like, a third- a sixth sense, for what podcast bits are the funniest. So I think that one will be great.

Baaulp: Since, uhh- since we've started- since our last episode, I should say. Uhh, there's-

Wayne: [crosstalk] Talking about our lives. The days of our lives.

Baaulp: Joker's Trick. Joker's Trick has-

Wayne, laughing: Joker's Trick was the most important of the last two months.

Baaulp, laughing: Yeaahh 

Wayne: Go follow Joker's Trick on twitter, it's the fucking- it's the next, like, it's the next big twitter, for sure.

Baaulp: Yeah, it- it is uhh, there's a mystique to it that I really enjoy.

Log: It's a real cultural milestone.

Wayne: There's a certain trick to it, that I really like. Might be Joker's Trick, but I don't know-

Trog: Now, you all say this, but I'm gonna offer a counterpoint, in that-

Wayne: I say this.

Trog: You all are fools, and in like four months whenever you're suddenly, randomly following like, some Adidas twitter. That-

Baaulp: What?

Trog: That was the Joker's Trick. He's gonna be one of those people that like gets all them followers, and then sells it once he gets enough followers.

Gir: Oh, you mean like horse e-books.

Wayne: Mira said this too- I think the person who runs that twitter listens to this podcast and engages with our community and I think they will not do that. I think they have an integrity.

Log: And if they are thinking of it, we've caught you.

Wayne: We've given you the idea. I mean- here's the thing. Get that money.

Trog: [crosstalk] Everybody has a price. All I'm saying.

Wayne: Get that money- if you- if you could turn Joker's Trick into something that could give you enough money to sustain the rest of your life, fucking do it. Quit your job. And then make a new Joker's Trick, you- cuz you could do that! You could-

Gir: Joker's New Trick

Wayne: You could give them the high follower account, and then- yeah, Joker's New Trick. And then just keep doing your thing, like, fuck it! Make some money, and go and do your own thing. 

Baaulp, laughing: Joker's Trick 2.

Wayne: Exactly. Joker's Second Trick

Baaulp: Yeah.

Gir: Joker's Final Trick

Trog: I would sell my twitter for 50 dollars right now.

Wayne: [laughs] Fucking- fucking, Nike contacts you- "We want your 100 follow twitter account. We need-"

Gir: We need that.

Wayne: We'll give you fifty bucks to reach these 100 people

Trog: You- you are being very generous in thinking that I have a hundred followers on twitter.

[Wayne laughs]

Log: You have 100 followers on twitter and all of them are Steve Jobs's clones! They're the most important ones, you know.

Wayne: And the only media they consume is your twitter! We need to get through to them!

Trog: Have to get them to invent the iPod 2.

Gir: 2 through 2 hundred

Wayne: Trog, let's make that real, like, make that a bit, and make every single one of your next tweets "Steve Jobs PLEASE make the iPod 2"

Trog: Alright, I'll tweet it right now

Wayne, laughing: [crosstalk] And just keep doing that constantly.

Log: You know, I kinda don't understand the twitters that do the same thing every day.

Baaulp: What do you mean?

Log: You know?

Wayne: Like what? 

Log: Joker's Trick comes up with a new trick everyday. However-

Wayne, laughing: Yes, it's always fresh and new.

Log: It's- you have stuff like the DNA combination or whatever?

Baaulp: Ohh yeah

Log: That just does the same thing everyday, or like, buff- buffcorrell vid or whatever.

Wayne: Wait, so- I don't understand, what is the DNA- I don't know what you're talking about. And buffcorrell, what do you mean?

Baaulp: There's a twitter account, where they just take two emojis and they'll s- they'll like arrange them so that it looks like a DNA spiral, and like, that's it. That's all that that account does. 

Trog:  Well, that's a bot.

Wayne: Yeah, those are all bots.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah, that's a bot.

Trog: That's not a person.

Wayne: buffcorrell's not a bot, buffcorrell is just a guy, who likes to dance. And wear, very strange make up or whatever.

Log: [crosstalk] But it's the same dance! 

Wayne: He does the same- I don't know, man- he- he's having fun! He's doing his thing.

Log: He- Okay, well alright leave buffcorrell we can keep him, alright? This is- this is the Karl Pilkington bit. Do we need 'em, alright? buffcorrell, we need him. Uh, DNA bot, eeghhh, get rid of it.

Wayne: No, we don't need- that- that shit's stupid, I've never even heard of that before but that sounds like a dumb idea. But another example of one we have to keep, wordtube bot!

Log: jaylenvids, or whatever.

Gir: Jay Leno?

Wayne: That's keep. I love it. I love that one.

Log: But it's just the same thing!

Wayne: Gah- But I love it! I will watch the same video but with different music a hundred times and I'll be entertained if the song is funny!

Log: Whenever, uhh, Smash Brothers- Smash Brothers had like, Joker or whatever, and whenever that character came out, there was an account that just posted the same gif of Joker firing his gun everyday, for like four weeks.

Wayne: Okay, that's- stupid. Why. Was th- was there anything more to that or-

Log: You can get rid of that one. I think it was like a mashup kinda thing but it was still just the same gif. Get rid of it. You don't need to do the same thing over and over again.

Wayne: You've heard of this mugshotsreal account? It keeps, like- posting like fake mugshots. I think we get rid of that one. 

Baaulp: Yeah, get rid of that one.

Log: Imagine if we just posted [??? visual studio?] everyday.

Baaulp: Yeah

Wayne: With a slight edit. We change one letter

Trog: Here's my take on twitters that need to go, and I think by saying this I think I'm gonna make some enemies because I bet some people that will listen to this probably follow some of the- the twitters I'm about to describe.

Wayne: I know what you're gonna say. 

Trog: But hey, if I'm calling you out, you deserve it, because I am tired of the trend-

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Uhh ohhhh, uh ohhhh, uhh oohhh!

Wayne: [crosstalk] You better change.

Trog: Here it is: I'm tired of the trend of twitters that are like "MP4s I found" or like, just like basic, generic, funny video twitters that literally just steal content.

Wayne: MP4s I have, cursed videos

Trog: Yeah, anything like that. You- if you follow those, if you reblog or retweet or whatever those- do you realize that they are literally just stealing and not crediting content from people, over and over?

Wayne: And I've got direct beef with them! They- It happened to me!

Trog: Exactly.

Wayne: It happened to me and they treated it as like, "you can have credit, if you ask nicely" as if it wasn't an obligation for them to credit the content they are stealing. The-

Trog: Exactly.

Wayne: And I didn't get credit, because I didn't ask nicely! I said "Hey, fuck you, take this down or credit me" and they were like "Oh, we'll take it down, we don't- we don't take threats" That was how that went with me.

Baaulp, talking like an old-timey aristocrat: You want credit? You'll have to get on your hands and knees and beg!

Wayne: You'll have to do a fair little jig. Entertain me.

Log: Try and solve my riddles three! 

[Snickering]

Wayne: Okay- Hey, lemme- lemme say that, if my content got stolen and I said "Please credit this, you need to credit this, fuck you" and they said "Here's a riddle, solve it" I would- [Trog laughs] I would be very impressed and would probably let them keep up the video.

[Gir laughs]

Trog: Well, now you know how to steal Wayne's content, you just have to offer him a riddle.

Wayne: Offer me a riddle! And you know I'm not good at 'em. [laughs] You know I won't do it!

Baaulp: Somewhere out there, there's a Sphinx in Egypt ready to hit up twitter right now.

[Laughter]

Gir: Yeah! Hahah-

Log: Yeah, there's a hidden one!

Trog: Official Trog Twitter rant-

Gir: [crosstalk] You never know.

Trog: If you follow, or retweet from the MP4s I found twitter, or any other twitter that is like that, just- just stop and think. Just stop and think "Hey, you know what? this video is funny, but also stolen." So-

Wayne: If it's that good, go find the source.

Trog: Exactly

Baaulp: It would be- it would even- it would require even less effort on their part to give credit. Because, what they could do is they could set up the twitter account, and then instead of stealing content they could literally just reblog the people that are putting their content on twitter. And like their account-

Gir: Yeah, but then they're not the ones with the funny notes

Baaulp: Yeah but you would follow them, you would follow them, to- they would still have a fuckton of followers because then people know "Oh if I follow this, I'll get to see, funny videos"

Gir: Uh, haha, Baaulp, I don't think you get it. They want the retweets. They want the numbers.

Trog: Yeah, so that they can sell their account to Adidas.

Wayne: [crosstalk] They love numbers.

Gir: Yeah. "I might not have a billion followers, but I do have a billion retweets" 

Wayne: That's their plan!

Trog: Yeah, it is.

Wayne: They act like it's just for fun but the moment they have a million followers and get offered a million dollars for the account, you know they're fucking doing it! These people are like eighteen! Like-

Trog: Yeah

Wayne:  They'll absolutely take millions of dollars for their million follower twitter account.

Baaulp, teen voice: Uuhh, Wayne, heheh, Wayne you gotta respect the hustle, uh, you know?

Trog: Nope. Yeah, that's what I tell to bank robbers too. 

Wayne: I w- like, and I n-no, and I was just saying that- I was just saying that, that I would respect the hustle for like, Joker's Trick. I don't respect it for "I have MP4s" who didn't put any work into it!

Baaulp, teen voice: I'm in middle school, and I stole gum from a convenience store, and when a policeman asked me nicely I said "You respect the hustle, bro, I'm, reselling-"

Wayne: You stole- you stole a bunch-

Gir: Baaulp you're fucked up

Wayne: You stole like 10 packs of gum, and then the cops came and said "Hey we'll give you a hundred dollars for that gum" and then...

[Laughing]

Trog: Gotta resell all this gum.

Baaulp: I don't- I don't condone stealing, I don't think I've ever stolen a single thing in my life. I'm sorry-

Wayne: I have!

Gir: You've pirated software, don't give me that bullshit.

Wayne: I've- I've commited crimes, and I'll talk about them publicly.

Baaulp: No, no, I've never-

Wayne: Hey, I can talk about my crimes because the grocery store that I took stuff from is now gone. It's closed forever.

Gir: Like the chain or just that one?

Wayne: The chain is gone.

Gir: Good, fuck em. What'd you do?

Wayne: Yeah- Uh, I stole- We used to just, you know those things with those like candy bins? The uh-

Gir: Oh, yeah

Wayne: I've talked on this on the podcast before

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah

Wayne: I've already gone into detail about this. But yeah, we took candy, opened up a pack of oreos, just took some and walked out.

Gir: I still hate that.

Wayne: I was a kid! It doesn't matter, I was in high school, middle school, I was a punk.

Gir: I- that's not-

Baaulp: You've talked about this before-

Gir: [crosstalk] You're old enough to know better.

Baaulp: But now the audience knows that you've outlasted them. You've survived and they failed.

Wayne: Yeah.

Baaulp: They died and you're alive.

Wayne: Yeah. I remain. I remain. The f- Gir, here's the thing, here's the thing. You say "oh you're in high school, you know better." Kids- kids in high school are fuckin' stupid! 

Gir: That's true. Yeah.

Wayne: And like, at that point we just cared about having fun. I didn't give a shit that I was taking some oreos. Now I wouldn't do it, cause I'm an adult, with money. If I want an oreo, I can buy a whole pack, eat one and let the rest go bad.

Baaulp: Yeah-

Wayne: Just kidding.

Gir: Like an adult!

Wayne: Yeah, like an adult.

Log: And if I don't have money, I can just sell my 10 stolen packs of gum to cops.

Wayne: Yeah-hah!

Gir: Yeah

Wayne: Well, I have to steal to do that one and that was the whole point of this conversation.

Log: Anyways- anyways, getting back to it, I just wanted to say that it was really funny. If you don't really know Gir and what he does, I think it's really funny that that you just said "Oh a grocery store chain closed down" and his response was just "Good, fuck em"

[chuckling]

Gir: Yeah fuck em!

Wayne: Gir hates grocery stores!

Gir, laughing: I ha-hate em!

Trog: He hates food.

Baaulp: I was just gonna bring up like, Gir's like "oh you're in high school, you know better." And that just reminds me of that one time, where I was walking- I think I've told this story before, but if I- if I have I'll fucking- I don't know. I ahh... I was walking into the bathroom in high school, and as I was walking in someone was leaving and was like "Hey, don't use the soap, I jerked off in there."

Trog: What?

Wayne: What?!

Gir: ...What?

Wayne: "Don't use the soap?"

Baaulp: Have I not told this story?

Trog: I mean, you did now!

Wayne: [crosstalk] No, I've never heard this story.

Trog: But I don't think I wanna hear anything else!

Log: It was probably a Joker's Trick.

Wayne: Have I not told this story? Says it again. Hey man, I cummed in the soap. Joker's Trick.

[laughter]

Trog: He strikes again.

Wayne: [crosstalk] What- so tell me about the cum soap. 

Trog: No!

Wayne: I don't understand. [mimicking Trog] No!

Baaulp: Well, the- tha- I mean, tha- that was basically it. The guy was just-

Wayne: Did he cum in the soap? Like in the-

Gir: Yes. In the dispenser.

Baaulp: In the dispenser.

Wayne: What? The fuck?

Trog: Now, it could just be a Joker's Trick.

Wanye: Why did he tell you?

Baaulp: He was doing me a solid, you know?

[Gir and Log laugh, Trog says something that's drowned out]

Wayne: But then why is he not doing a solid to anyone else?

Baaulp: Cause he's like "Oh, this guy- this guy needs to take a shit."

Wayne: This guy needs to know where I put my cum.

Log: He was doing a liquid for everyone else.

Trog: [crosstalk] I hate this story...

Baaulp: Cause that's a prank that like, no one would know about, you know-

Wayne: It's not a prank!

Baaulp: They would use the- they would just use the soap-

Gir: Gotcha! You washed the hands with my cum!

Wayne: That's fucking biological warfare. That's like a hazard that this man has placed.

Baaulp: Okay, okay so he did that-

Wayne: It's not a prank.

Baaulp: And I'm guessing, the prank- he's gotta let someone in on the prank.

Wayne: [crosstalk] It's not a prank! Stop calling it that.

Baaulp: So he's like "Perfect, this guy's about to enter the restroom. I'll tell him so that someone knows and can spread the word, and so people know about my prank." Other than that, y'know-

Wayne: THAT'S NOT-

Baaulp: If he didn't tell anyone, people would-

Wayne: Did you spread the word? I mean I guess you're doing it now. His legacy lived on. Everyone- like- now the thousands of listeners we have are gonna know about the man who cummed in the school soap dispenser. The word has spread! He's a legend!

Baaulp: Eh- you cut me off, I was about to say, like-

Wayne: He sells his twitter acount!

Baaulp: Had he not told anyone, people would have just used that soap and not known. Uh, I did not use the soap, and I think by the time I got back to the classroom I forgot.

Wayne: You should have told a fucking teacher! That's something that-

Gir: You know- No-

Wayne: Here's the thing, here's the thing, it's like "Oh, don't be a- don't be a fucking-" wait what's the word?

Gir: Narc

Wayne: Na- oh yeah, don't be a fucking Narc. Don't be a narc. But it's like- that's for when people are doing like, respectable, cool shit. Like stealing!

Gir: Respectable crimes!

Trog: Respectable, cool crimes!

Wayne: That guy's a fucking pervert! Like, that's-

Gir: No- nonono! That's the point I wanted to make, that if he had told nobody, that would have been like a sex pervert thing. The fact that he told Baaulp means that he didn't do a thing, he just wanted to make someone think he did a thing.

Trog: Yeah, I don't think he did it.

Wayne: I don't know...

Gir: He didn't cum in the soap. Was it that, like pearly white soap-

Baaulp: Yes

Gir: That they used to have in dispensers? Yeah, see? 

Wayne: Yeah, that's why he came in it! So-

Gir: He didn't cum in it cause you would not even realize it even if he did!

Wayne: Also, if he came in it, you were probably still good to use the soap. He probably came in like the top of it. Like-

Baaulp: [laughs] Oh no...

Log: There's no way he could have done that!

Gir: [crosstalk] That's true, actually.

Log: The- the soap comes in like a plastic squeeze bag.

Wayne: Yeah, he would have had to rip the squeeze bag open, unless you- unless you've got some weird, old-timey dispenser. You're an old man.

Trog: If you think-

Gir: [crosstalk] He has a hypodermic dick.

Trog: That the Cum Soap Kid did it, go on to twitter and use the hashtag-

Wayne: [crosstalk] I actually wanna know!

Trog: #IThinkTheCumSoapKidDidIt

Gir: The Cum Soap Kid!

Wayne: [laughs] The Cum Soap Kid! Fuck yeah

Trog: If you think that the Cum Soap Kid didn't do it and it was a trick, go use hasthag #IDontThinkTheCumSoapKidDidIt on twitter.

[laughter]

Log: Rockstar Games is looking really closely at this and they're gonna decide on the next Red Dead Redemption 2 DLC

Trog: Yeah

Log: Based on the outcome.

Wayne: I'm legitimately curious, I wanna see people's theories on how this went down and whether or not this actually happened.

Baaulp: You know, uh, you also have to understand that like, the school I went to, uh, the bathrooms were basically exclusively, like, for kids to smoke in and fight in. So,

[Wanye and Gir laugh]

Gir: I mean, that's uh-

Baaulp: Like...

Gir: That's not just you, to be fair. That was just kinda high school.

Log: Yeah, the pee just went away in that school.

Wayne: That makes me think that my high school bathrooms were relatively tame. I think the worst thing that happened is that, like, we had a lockdown or some shit because a kid put weed in the ceiling, or something like that. 

Gir: We, uh, because I lived on a military base- or I went to school on a military base, overseas, the bathrooms were like- you don't- you wanna be careful in there. You gotta be careful.

Trog: Cause they put C4 in there.

Wayne: There's like falling rocks. There's pitfalls.

Gir: No no no! There was a, a girl who went into one of the girl's bathrooms-

Wayne: Never came out

Gir: And just set a fire? 

Trog: What?

Baaulp: Oh, shit.

Gir: But because she set fire to what was technically government property, she got deported.

Trog: Well, yeah

Wayne: Holy shit. That's- that's rough.

Gir: [crosstalk] And then that was really funny because she was a dumbass and I was glad to see her get kicked out.

Wayne: Well, s- expelled is one thing, deported is another

Gir: She had to! She destroyed goverment property outside of her home country.

Wayne: Oh wait, is this- was this a base school?

Gir: Yeah, I- did you not listen to the first fucking part of my sentence?

Wayne: Like I- You know I don't listen.

Gir: I know.

Wayne: So, the um... let's- let's move on. Gir, you've got any work stories, lately? Cause I've got some work stories. 

Gir: Welcome to the segment, Gir's Gripes.

Baaulp: I'll edit in a little jingle.

Gir: The story of the day-

Wayne: [singing, crosstalk] Gir's Gripes, Gir's Gripes

Gir: Yesterday, someone started a dumpster fire.

Trog: Nice.

Wayne: Holy shit, man. That fuckin- man, people will- people will just throw random bullshit in my dumpster at my work. A couple of weeks ago, somebody threw like- you know like a GMod, like a blue, plastic barrel?

Baaulp & Gir: Yeah

Trog: Mm-hmm

Wayne: There was one of those just full of sticks and it was fucking giant and fucking heavy, and someone threw the whole ass thing in the dumpster, which confuses me cause it's like- that was a perfectly good barrel, so why not just dump the sticks? No, they threw out the barrel too.

Gir: Free firewood.

Wayne: Anyway, back to the dumpster fire.

Gir: Anyway, I don't know who started, I don't know why they started it, all I know is... I was like leaving work and I go into our backroom and was like "What the fuck, it smells like smoke back here" and I asked one of the guys back there, I was like "What's burning?" and he was like "Oh yeah, the dumpster." 

Wayne: We're making smores out here.

Gir: I was like, "What?" I look out our back door and the- there it is, there was a dumpster with a big ass fire and like, four firefighters spraying right into it.

Wayne: Who the fuck?

Gir: I was like "Oohhh, okay."

Trog: Now, it's possible it could've been, you know, I mean it's summer in Las Vegas, it gets hot, maybe there was just like-

Gir: It was overcast.

Trog: Someone threw away magnifying glass and it- it-

Gir: It was overcast.

Wayne: And it was pointed at some paper.

Log, laughing: And it hovered in the air and caught [???]

Trog: Yeah

Gir, laughing: Perfectly still

Wayne: I mean, it could be like a cigarette.

Baaulp: Someone was throwing away a piece of wood and someone was throwing away a magnifying glass and they both tossed it in and it was, it was fate.

Wayne: You know, we were talking about cool and respectable crimes. If you wanted to commit arson, a dumpster fire is the safest way.

Gir: I don't believe you.

Trog: [crosstalk] I guess?

Wayne: Cause like, a dumpster's always gonna be like, 

Baaulp: ???

Wayne: Surrounded, by like- generally a dumpster's only gonna be surrounded by shit that's not gonna carry the fire, it's gonna be on like concrete.

Gir: This dumpster was next to buildings that were being constructed.

Wayne: Okay, well then, whoever did that is going to hell, and I don't condone it

Trog: You hear that, guy who started the dumpster fire with a magnifying glass and a piece of wood?

Wayne: [crosstalk] You're going to hell

Trog: Warned you.

Wayne: Why- why would you suspend a magnifying glass in mid-air, you piece of shit?

Gir: Here's a two-for-one for yesterday, cause yesterday was fucking weird. There was a lady who was shoplifting, she, you know, unloading a bunch of shit into her shopping cart, and she ran out of the door as fast as she could. And when people ran out to see where she went with it, because their shopping carts have like that locking thing on it?

Wayne: [crosstalk] She jumped into the dumpster fire.

[Trog laughs]

Gir: No- she- not only did she steal the stuff that was in the shopping cart, she lifted the entire cart and threw it into the back of her truck and left.

Wayne: Ho-oly shit!

Gir: She went fucking whole hog ham on that.

Wayne: That's awesome, honestly.

Baaulp: We're building like uh, like a very impressive rogues gallery here [laughs]

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: We have the Joker, the guy that cums in the soap dispensers

Wayne: Oh, I've got- I've got an addition for you 

Baaulp: The guy who starts dumpster fires at supermarkets

Wayne: The next- the next member of our rogues gallery, alright, so my story. This happened like a month ago at this point, and it's a very short story. So, I work at a pet store, and we have like, we have like fish and aquatic shit, so we have fish decorations. Um, there- we sell like a Spongebob house, like a ceramic like-

Baaulp: Uh huh

Wayne: Like, Spongebob pineapple. And I saw a kid grab it off the shelf, run, run halfway across the store to his mom, and I- and I heard him say "Mommy! Spob house!" and his mom didn't do anything, he immediately just f- spiked it into the floor and started screaming.

Gir: What?!

Trog: What?

Gir: Ah haha, I hate kids!

Trog: Did he break it?

Wayne: Yes, he- it just destroy- like, I think that kid, might have fully understa- understood the power he had being a kid where it's like 

Wayne: "Alright, I'm gonna take this to my mom and see if she'll buy it. She doesn't want it? Okay I could just break it and I'll get away with it." Like, he knew- he knew what he could do.

Trog: Here's what you should have done, you should have went up to that kid afterwards and been like "You- you killed Spongebob"

[Wayne and Gir start laughing]

Trog: "He was in there. You killed him." Because that's gonna fuck that kid up for life.

Gir: Aahh, yeah you should've fucked that kid up for life, Wayne. 

Trog: Should've told him he killed Spongebob.

Log: No crimes happen around here.

Wayne: You have to go apologize to his parents, here's the lake you need to go to

Baaulp: Log, that's a good thing.

Log: Well-

Gir: That is a good thing.

Log: It's not good whenever we have to tell stories about crime.

Wayne: Did you guys hear those stories when you were kids, about- about kids who died trying to find Bikini Bottom?

Trog: No-

Baaulp: No, what?

Trog: What?

Wayne: Were those like, urban legends or were any of those real?

Trog: Those, have to be just bullshit

Gir: [crosstalk] That's- that sounds like chain mail.

Wayne: There were two- so there were two that were go around when I was a kid. One of them was, much less believable than the other one. One of them was like "Yeah, a kid just like, was swimming in a lake and kept trying to sw- to like, swim to the bottom to find Bikini Bottom and they drowned." And the other one was like-

Trog: In a lake?

Wayne: Yeah, and then the other one was like-

Trog: Do they know where the show takes place at?

Wayne: Well, well listen to this. The other one was like, a kid wanted to find Bikini Bottom so he put his fish bowl on his head and died in it. The-

Trog: That's-

Wayne: I don't think that one-

Baaulp: That, that is-

Trog: That is like, top tier playground bullshit. For sure.

Wayne: Aw man, they'll never find Spob House.

Log: The most evil-

Wayne: That's like- oh man, did that kid just call Spongebob just "Spob" straight up? Or did...

[laughter]

Gir, singing to the Spongebob theme: Spob spance, spob spance!

Wayne: No it's just "Spob, spob! Spob!" 

Baaulp: Alright

Gir: Spob spob, spob! 

Log: The most evil thing that's happened-

Wayne: Spob spob, spob spooooob!

Log: The most evil-

Wayne: Doo doo do doot-

[Laughter]

Log: The most evil-

Trog: And this is the part of the show where we all just grunt!

Wayne: Spoooob!

Gir: I'm so sorry Log!

Log: The most evil thing that's happened to me as of late, is I was going down the stairs in my apartment complex

Wayne: Evil events.

Log: And at the bottom of the steps I discovered a box of gourmet cupcakes.

Wayne: Mmm!

Gir: That's evil.

Log: And I couldn't eat them because they were open.

[Wanye laughs a little]

Gir: Oh, that's-

Trog: Shoulda did it anyway.

Wayne: Shoulda hit up Dino Tendies, he would've.

Log: Later I came back and somebody had also found the gourmet cupcakes, and just took them off the step and put them in the corner, next to the step.

Wayne: So people don't step on em!

Gir: Yeah

Baaulp: Alright, ehh, okay, so-

Log: What's the point?-

Wayne: Can that be our other segment? Evil Events?

Log: It's pretty much pavement.

Wayne: Gir's Gripes, Evil Events? Wayne's Whims?

Baaulp: So, uh, I have a hypothetical question-

Wayne: Baaulp, what's your event?

Baaulp: I don't have one. Sorry.

Trog: I have one.

Baaulp: Or- that, or I don't remember

Wayne: What's yours?

Baaulp: What's your event, yeah

Trog: My event, uuh, so I know that- I dunno if we've talked about this- definitely not on the podcast, but like, you know the video of the guy who's walking down the street, and he's like "Man I'm telling you, some people aren't even real they're just GTA 5 NPC's"

Wayne, doing an impression: GTA Created Characters! Yeah

Baaulp: Uh oh, uh oh

Trog: Yeah, exactly. I had an experience like that driving home from work yesterday, where I drove past a purple like, like hard purple Jeep without the top on, with two identical looking women in the front seat, both like- like generic looking, white, blonde, long hair with the like big girl sunglasses that have like the white frames? 

Wayne, laughing: Big g-

Trog: Like, they might have been twins and I just drove past them and I just though "Wow, I don't think those people were real."

[Wayne, Baaulp and Gir laugh]

Wayne: Were they- were they like, low poly?

Trog: I think those were GTA 5 NPC's, like they didn't look like real people!

Baaulp: What radio station were they listening to?

Trog: I dunno, I had my windows closed, I was driving home, but I just saw them and was like "Damn. Wild shit."

Baaulp: The most evil thing I can remember was, I was at the supermarket last night buying coffee grounds and there was a couple arguing. That's it.

Wayne: Wow, that's fucking- that's fucking dastardly

Trog: That's not very evil.

Wayne: That's illegal! 

Trog: That's not really evil, that's- I dunno what that is.

Baaulp: That- that's all I can really think of that's happened around me personally. I mean, I'm sure more evil things have happened, but I just can't remember, because my memory does not focus on evil events. I focus on good events. 

Gir: I'm surrounded by evil. 

Wayne: I'm gonna have to like, remember that "Alright, I gotta look out for evil shit that's going on"

Baaulp: Yeah, that's what I'm gonna have to do too. Cause I'm sure stuff happens, but I just like- you know, I see it, I note it, and then I store it away and I forget about it because it's not worth remembering.

Wayne: My other work story happened today and it's just like, it's a pet store so people bring their dogs in and people will put the dogs in carts, and I like was talking to this dude with a dog in his cart, and he walked halfway down the aisle and I was talking to him about like "Oh yeah, you wanna buy this dog food" or whatever, talking to him about like changing foods.

Wayne: And then my other coworker comes up and starts talking to him, cause I gotta go, so I like- I go over and start petting his dog, and I take a few steps away, and she says like "Alright, I'm gonna show you this dog food" so she walks away with the guy with the dog food, and I'm just left there with the dog in the cart, and they walk like across the store and I'm just kinda standing there like "You're just leaving... you're just leaving your dog here in the cart? In the middle of the aisle?" so I'm standing there, and I start pushing the dog in the cart like trying to find them, cause I don't know exactly where they went, and I find them but they're sandwiched between 3 other people so I'm stuck standing- tending to this dog for like 5 minutes. Frankly it was pretty cool, cause I just got to be with this dog for a while. But also, what the fuck- he just like- he wasn't even like, looking for me, I just stood at the end of the aisle and he didn't even see me. I had to like, after a couple minutes "Okay this is a good way to waste my time" but I just need to be like "Hey bro, your dog man, you just left him over there" and he's just "Oh, oh cool, sorry" and I'm like, yeah, I just walked off and chuckled about it.   

Gir: Yeah, I've seen stuff like that at my store, but instead of dogs, it's infants

Wayne: It's babies? Yeah- [laughs]

Gir: Yeah, and purses. You're putting too much trust in the world to not think someone's gonna come over and either steal or harm either one.

Wayne: I train my baby in self defense, and I train my purse in self defense.

Baaulp: I have a question, okay?

Wayne: Okay.

Baaulp: The Joker, the kid that cums in soap dispensers, uh, Spongebob killer kid-

Wayne: You need- you need- ok wait, no- you need more creative names for these guys, so- so the Joker, obviously

Gir: The Cum Soap Kid

Wayne: The Spob Spiker-

Baaulp: [crosstalk] The Cum Soap Kid- The Spob Spiker? Okay.

Wayne: Spob Spiker. What are the others?

Baaulp: What about the arsonist?

Gir: ...The Arsonist.

Baaulp: Okay. The four of them, let's go around and let's think of a crime they would commit, like as a team.

Gir: I think the arsonist would commit arson.

Wayne: They got like an Ocean's Six.

Baaulp: Yeah

[Baaulp starts laughing while Trog chuckles for a bit]

Baaulp: Whatever this crime is-

Trog: Ocean's Three?

Baaulp: Whatever this crime is, it involves cumming in a soap dispenser

Gir: I was gonna to say, I don't think- I don't think cumming in soap-

Wayne: Well no, it doesn't have to be in a soap dispenser, he's an effective trained cummer. He can cum in something else.

Gir: "Oh, what's your skill?" "Oh, I can cum"

Wayne: "I can cum real good"

Trog: Projectile cumming

Wayne: I got these accurate shots. I got a- I got a- I got a KDA of 5

Log: He can knock out the security with his accurate shots.

[Wayne starts making gun shooting noises]

Trog: Yeah, he shoots out the security cameras. It's like the same thing as spray painting them, but...

Wayne: He's like jerking off on camera and the security guard's like that Deagle Nation guy and he doesn't wanna look at it and is like "I do not look at dicks on security cams!" and when he's not looking he cums in the camera and... fries the circuits

Trog: Uh-huh. Sure. Hey, can we talk about anything else?

Wayne: We're gonna rob a bank with a homophobic guard. We- jerk off in front of the camerea.

Baaulp: What do the other three villains do?

Gir: Villains...

Wayne: The Spob Spiker could like, knock out a guard once, uh. Cause as soon as he spikes the guard in the head with the ceramic, he would start screaming, so he'd give himself away. He's also like a decoy.

Trog: And he's like six

Wayne: Yes

Log: I think the existence of the Spob Spiker lends this group towards like vandalism acts. Like, they get to the end and they get the treasure and they hand it to him and he, he uh-

Gir: He spikes it.

Log: He spikes the diamond into the ground and it shatters and he screams

[chuckles]

Baaulp: You know what, that would fit because the Joker doesn't care about getting rich, he just wants to prove a point.

Trog: It's true

Wayne: Oh yeah, the Joker is a part of this. So people are gonna die in this if the Joker's there.

[Baaulp starts laughing]

Trog: This shit is stacked

Gir: So we've got a dude that starts dumpster fires, a guy who cums in soap dispensers, a literal child, and the Joker from Batman. 

Trog: Mm-hmm.

Gir: Talk- yeah, that's a rogues gallery alright.

Wayne: Also a really strong woman. 

Baaulp: The Joker's gonna sneak the guy who cums in soap dispensers into like, a pharmaceutical lab and he's gonna- he's gonna ruin like a batch of vaccines.

Gir: The lady who lifts an entire shopping cart is the only one that's like useful here.

Baaulp: No-

Wayne: No, the Joker isn't useful?

Gir: [crosstalk] Oh yeah, the arsonist too

Trog: The Joker isn't useful?

Gir: I mean- besides the Joker.

Trog: I mean the Joker, he's the wild card, you know? You don't know what he's gonna do.

Wayne: I mean, the arsonist could be useful.

Gir: [doing a Joker impression] Alright, Cum Soap Kid, I need you to cum in this soap for me.

Wayne: Yeah, I like that it's his only skill-

Gir: [crosstalk] Batman won't see it coming!

Wayne: I mean- okay, so- no, the Cum Soap Kid- the Cum Soap Kid has fucking, he's got stealth points, like he's absolutely got stealth skill, because the fucking- he did it without anyone noticing, the only reason you knew is because he told you, no one saw him! 

Baaulp: Yeah, yeah

Wayne: So he's absolutely their stealth guy, like he's gonna be ducking underneath all the lasers that he just revealed with the smoke, and he's gonna cum at the same time to... to fry the lasers, and...

Log: Well, he's either stealthy or just really fast. 

Baaulp: Oohh, yeah

Wayne: Oh yeah, he might have speed on his side!

Baaulp: He's like a- he's like an anti-Flash kinda guy.

Wayne: Yeah, they've got like a planner, like "What are your skills?" "Oh, I'm the Joker" "Oh, I'm really good at fires" "I can cum in ten seconds"

[laughter]

Log: What power is "The Joker"?

[Wayne makes noises]

Trog: It's the Joker!

Wayne: If you- if you were- Okay, okay, I don't like the Joker, you know- you know of my enjoyment of the Joker and how that works- the context. But if the Joker was real and you knew everything he's done in his fiction and you were like doing a crime and the Joker was on your team, you know what he's capable of! He could just say "I'm the Joker" and you'd fucking know!

Gir: I don't wanna be on this team. 

Wayne: What, are you gonna ask for his fucking death- his murder resume, like what do you want from him?

Baaulp: Of course I cum fast, I got crimes to commit...

[laughter]

Wayne: Let's move on.

Baaulp:  Yeah, yeah [laughs]

Wayne: This is getting bad.

Trog: I was done with this 15 minutes ago 

Wayne: I know! You were barely participating.

Baaulp: I- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just wanted an answer to what crazy ass crime to commit.

Wayne: [crosstalk] No, people are gonna love that

Trog: Sometimes you don't need answers to every question.

Wayne: This episode of the podcast i- we haven't even gotten to questions. And that brings us to a good point, is it time for questions?

Baaulp: Yes, yeah, yeah

Trog: I mean, it might as well be

Gir: Can I start off with my own question first?

Trog: Wait, is it like a question from the audience or is it a question for-

Gir: It's a question that I had for everyone

Trog: W- ok, sure

Wayne: That happens in part 1

Log: Can you present it as a member of the audience, please?

Gir: Yes, hello, can I speak now?

Wayne: Hold on, send it to me in a DM and I'll read it like you sent it to me?

[Trog chuckles]

Gir: That's- Really?

Wayne: Yeah!

Gir: I will stop what we're doing right now and just do it.

Trog: Alright, time for the intermission portion.

Gir: Hold on everybody, I'm sending Wayne a message.

Log: They had that shit.

Trog: Throw in like the Jeopardy sound.

Log: Every good podcast has an intermission segment.

Trog: Mmhmmm. Sure.

[Beat]

Log: Yeah, it's the part where they talk about Squarespace and stuff.

Gir: Alright, I sent in- I submitted a question for Wayne.

Trog: We're not sponsored though.

Log: Yeah

Trog: Hey, if you'd like to sponsor us, email somebody.

Wayne: Alright-

Log: We don't have sponsors. People have no chance to get up and leave, so we've gotta make our own.

Wayne: Welcome to Questions, Quests and Queries, uh, so... Alright, our beloved-

Log: That's the new name for it.

Wayne: Our beloved audience member MasterGir asks: "What's the rarest game you have ever owned? Hi, I'm Gir" ...don't know what that last part is.

Trog: That's weird. Weird way to end it.

Wayne: So what's the rarest game you have ever owned?

Trog: Hmmm...

Gir: And let me start off my own question with my own answer and say uh, Digimon World for the PS1.

Trog: Is that rare?

Wayne: That's rare?

Gir: It's rare to get now, it costs like over a hundred dollars to get a physical copy.

Wayne: [crosstalk] But that's just like... shovelware.

Gir: It's not shovelware!

Trog: It's not shovelware, but...

Wayne: I guess- I mean, I just hold Digimon at such a low

Gir: It was a limited run game, it didn't get that many translated copies.

Baaulp: Are you asking this because you wanna show off?

Gir: No, I-

Wayne: I mean, I have an answer

Gir: I have a genuine- I would like to genuinely know, cause I was gonna ask outside of the podcast and was like "Hmmm?"

Wayne: I had, um, one time when I was innnnnn 9th grade? 8th grade? 9th grade? I don't know- I found unopened copies of Paper Mario and Conker's Bad Fur Day in my attic. 

Gir: What the fuck?

Baaulp: Oh, shit

Trog: Pretty cool.

Wayne: I sold them. I got like, 200 bucks each or something like that.

Gir: Holy shit.

Trog: Nice. I think the rarest game I own is probably like the steel case Metroid Prime trilogy for the Wii? I don't think you can get that anymore, but I don't have any facts to back that up. So maybe that one.

Wayne: Yeah, his is a weird question because I don't think most people own rare games.

Gir: That's why I asked what's the rarest

Baaulp: I think mine is just Kirby's Tilt 'n' Tumble. That's it. 

Wayne: I'm looking at, uh, I have the jewel case for Doom 2. Which- wait, no, not Doom 2, fucking Diablo 2. Or maybe it's Diablo 1? Lemme grab it [grunts as he reaches for it]

Trog: I have the Soul Slicer

Wayne: Yeah, it's the jewel case for Diablo 2, it's in terrible condition but this shit looks so cool. 

Gir: That's not rare, I found that at Goodwill like, a month ago. 

Wayne: I know, I'd have to look up and see how actually rare they are, and then I have the dual jewel case for Planetscape: Torment and a game called Soulbringer, but those are just old, they're not necessarily rare.

Log: I have Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn for the Wii.

Wayne: Is that rare?

Log: I'm pretty sure it's a good 80 or 90 dollars on the old ebay.

Trog: I have Riku trapped in a crystal prison on my mantleplace.

Baaulp: Oh yeah

Wayne: That's true

Gir: That's not a game, that's an object.

Baaulp: That's still- it's video game related.

Trog: I mean, I could play it, I just don't want to

Log: I dunno, I really don't know how much anything is worth.

Trog: Me neither, money is fake

Wayne: How do you play- how do you play Riku in a Crystal?

Trog: What, you didn't even try to play with it? 

Wayne: No, I don't know how

Trog: You like, you grab it and you're like "C'mon Sora, let's go! Time to..." [laughs] I don't-

[Wayne laughs]

Gir: You use your net. [???]

Trog: Time to fight the heartless? That's my bit, for this podcast.

Wayne: "Oh no, I got stuck in a crystal prison!" And then you shake him, and then he screams.

Gir: If you fuck up, he swaps places with you

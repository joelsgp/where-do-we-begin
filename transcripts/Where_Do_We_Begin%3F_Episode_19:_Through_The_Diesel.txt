Wayne: The year is 2021. A new era has dawned. We have entered the year of the Beast. And I ask you a question. Where do we begin? My name is WayneRadioTV, the New Year’s Baby.

Trog: I am CyberTrog 2021. Refund me.

Log: I’m the King of the Stump.

Baaulp: Uh, my name is Baaulp.

Wayne: And our special guest—WUUUUGH??? Tim Allen! Wooo!

[Sounds of one person clapping rapidly]

Wayne: Give it up for Tim Allen everybody, we got him! We pulled him out of the cocaine! Just for a podcast!

[Holly laughs]

Trog: I don’t-I didn’t—I don’t think we should have Tim Allen on our podcast.

Baaulp: Yeah, I don’t think we should have Tim Allen, I don’t-I don’t agree with this.

Wayne: Me neither. We’re here to talk-we’re gonna list off every awful thing he’s done—

Trog: [Crosstalk] We’re gonna beat him up!

Log: Yeah!

Wayne: —and then we’re gonna beat him up—

[Holly laughs]

Log: Yeah, I don’t think so, Tim.

[Wayne and Holly laugh]

Wayne: That’s the episode title, “I don’t think so, Tim.” We already got it.

[Holly laughs harder]

Trog: Yeah.

Holly, still laughing: This bit fucking sucks!

Wayne: No, it’s not Tim Allen, I tricked you! It’s Tim Holly! Holly, welcome, Holly. How’re you doing?

Holly: Ha, you fell for it, it’s me! Uh—

Wayne: You have been pranked!

Holly: I ate, uh, an apple that I cut into slices, and then ate some bell pepper and a yogurt and a bit of peanut butter and some pieces of cheese, and that was my dinner today!

Wayne: All together?

Holly: Yeah, that was my dinner today because I was like, “Y’know, all I’ve eaten today before this is like, a heap of beans and ground beef, I should have something else that isn’t that.”

Wayne: There’s no chemistry there, in those items!

Log: Living a positively Roman life.

Holly: It’s a charcuterie board for assholes! Living that 2021 life!

Wayne: That’s what we call a poopoo platter.

Holly: I don’t think that’s what they call a poopoo platter [laughs].

Wayne: Well that is… y’know, because it’s bullshit. It’s bullshit dinner.

[Holly laughs]

Wayne: All that stuff is good, like, that is the kind of meal that you eat when—

Holly: Mhmm.

Wayne: You look at that, you eat that, you taste that, your senses-your senses begin and you think, “Sustenance.”

Holly: Mhmm!

Wayne: Like, you-when you eat that meal, you’re getting vitamins, you’re getting protein, you get it all—

Holly: Right.

Wayne: But it’s not-it’s not appropriate. It’s an inappropriate dinner.

Holly: I ate it specifically because I needed fruit and vegetables in my body and basically stuff that wasn’t just a heap of meat or I would die!

Wayne: Mhmm. Mhmm mhmm. Mhmm. I feel like that right now, actually. My dinner will probably be not too different.

Holly: Get your tide-amins and getch-tables, kids! Uh, or else I’ll fuckin’—I’ll find you, so, don’t do it.

Baaulp: I get all my nutrients—I’m like a-I’m like a apex predator, I only eat meat and their nutrients goes into me—Wait, that’s bad.

Holly: [Laughs] Uh-huh!

Wayne: Have you seen Jordan Peterson?

[Holly laughs]

Baaulp: Yeah. It’d be really funny when he dies.

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]

Trog: Damn, alright. Startin’ 2021 off strong.

Wayne: We are throwing mud on this episode of the podcast! Tim Allen? Fuck you. Jordan Peterson? Fuck you. You’re on the list!

Holly: Who else are we going to irreparably burn bridges with?

Log: Jordan Peterson isn’t living a hunter’s life. He’s eating the raw meat from the store, the-the—

Baaulp: That’s true!

Wayne: He’s eating raw ground beef without cleaning it, and then he doesn’t move. He just sits still.

Trog: It doesn’t have the adrenaline in it.

[Baaulp laughs]

Log: Those cows haven’t gotten those nutrients.

Trog: Exactly.

[Wayne laughs]

Holly: I like the idea of-of some like, fuckhead like Jordan Peterson just like, shoveling down raw meat into his gullet and then sitting still for four hours at a time!

Wayne: You wanna know something?

Holly: Yeah!

Trog: Gotta digest it.

Wayne: I only learned last year like—Okay, obviously—Let me preface this by saying obviously, I know you’re not supposed to eat raw beef—

Holly: Mhmm?

Wayne: But I only like, thought about it, and realized and learned last year like, why you are not supposed to eat raw ground beef. Specifically ground beef.

[Holly laughs]

Trog: Why is that?

Wayne: Like, because it is like, whenever you are getting like, steaks, meat that is just cut from the animal, the exterior is all that is making contact with like, outside contaminants—

Holly: Right.

Wayne: So you could clean that off, and in theory, you could eat that raw meat, and you would only get sick from the fact that it is raw meat.

Holly: Mhmm.

Wayne: You can kill bacteria and whatnot on it. With ground beef you can’t do that—

Holly: Right, it’s all mixed it.

Wayne: Because all of that beef, yes! Because it’s all mixed in! And I never-I never realized like, exactly how awful it could be, because you can’t wash the inside of raw beef, you can’t do that.

[Holly laughs]

Trog: And that’s just ruined raw beef Fridays around here for everybody, we were all really upset about it.

[Holly and Wayne laugh]

Log: I'm surprised you figured out about this now, like-

Wayne:[Crosstalk] I've just never thought about it!

Log: Like this was like a- like a dire word of caution that my mother gave me as a young child. It's like-

[Holly laughs]

Wayne: Were you just constantly pawing at the raw beef?

Log: [Crosstalk] No!

Wayne: Like doing grabby hands at it?

Log; No! It's cause-

[Holly laughs]

Log: Okay, you've been like to a like a pla-, like, I don't know- I don't know if they do it different up in New England but I've certainly been to a place where you can like go to a restaurant and sit down and order a burger and they're like 'D'you want that- uh, how do you want your burger? You want it medium rare? D'you want it rare? You want a rare burger?"

Wayne: I mean but that shit's- but like, rare is different. Like you can eat a- like a medium rare burger is like to- por- totally normal, like that's what I get, like a medium rare burger.

Log: But the inside is still like- why- why would the same rule not apply, Wayne?

Wayne: Because it's not raw, it is, it is less, it is-

Baaulp: It has made contact with the heat, to some degree.

Wayne: It- like that's the thing, it's not raw, it HAS been cooked to a proper acceptable temperature. It is not BELOW, like the-the e. coli bar or whatever

Baaulp; Now- now steak tartare, no one's gonna get between me and my Steak Tartare Saturdays

Log: You can enjoy your- your rare burger and your rare chicken and I'll sit down and eat a real-

Wayne: [Cutting in] Medium rare is not rare!

Log: I'll- I'll eat a fully cooked meal. 

Wayne: Like, I usually go for a medium burger, but like there are times in certain restaurants where I would get like a medium rare. It's something that I learned from my Father.

Log: He didn't tell you about the raw ground beef, did he?

[Wayne and Holly laugh]

Wayne; Well that's why I don't eat a rare- ! Like! And I- Lookit, I'm not- I'm not uncritical! I LOOK at my burger, I look INSIDE of the patty, and I see its deepest secrets, and I- I make sure to take that into account, I don't just, I don't just bl-close my eyes and eat the burger and accept whatever, like monsters are entering my body!

Holly:[Wheezes] MONSTERS?

Wayne: [Short laugh] Yeah, germs is monsters, same thing

[Holly laughs]

Baaulp; This is related, I do want to try this, it sounds- as a Westerner, it sounds SO scary, it sounds SO fuckin' scary, but apparently there it's relatively normal. I want to try- they have, like chicken sashimi in Japan.

Holly: Do they actually?

Trog: [Crosstalk] No. Wrong.

Baaulp: Yes. [Crosstalk] Yes. Yes.

Holly: Do they actually?

Baaulp; Yes.

Trog: No way.

Baaulp; Allegedly, the reason why no one gets sick is because the standards for poultry there are a lot higher.

Holly: Hm.

Baaulp; Like, they don't have the same farming practices for poultry that we do here. Like, chickens, I think, usually get treated better in Japan, I assume.

Holly: [affirmative hum]

Baaulp: And so they're just like- yeah. You go into a lot of like,yakitori places- I mean they're grilling most of their chicken, but like sometimes on their menus you'll see 'chicken sashimi' and it is just like a SLICE of RAW chicken.

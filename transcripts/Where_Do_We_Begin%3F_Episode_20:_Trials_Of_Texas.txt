[WIP]

Wayne: [In a southern accent] We're livin' in some dire times. Times like these, I ask myself... where do we begin?

Wayne: [accent] My name is WayneradioTV.

Trog: I'm... Trog. And I'm not sure what this intro is.

Wayne: [accent] I live in Texas now. I've changed. I'm a different man.

Log: [In a southern accent] It's times like these that make a man act a fool!

Wayne: Times like these make a man a FOOL!

Log: [accent] Such as me, Logmore!

Baaulp: I'm Baaulp.

Gir: I'm Gir.

[Silence, followed by Gir and Baaulp laughing]

Wayne: And this... is the Where Do We Begin podcast! TEXAS edition!

Trog: Some people have more interesting intros than other people.

Log: Sometimes people aren't in Texas, and they can't-

Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah, we don't live in Texas! Me and Gir aren't in Texas!

Wayne: Majority rules, MOST of us live in Texas, so this is a Texas podcast.

Baaulp: This is a southern podcast now? All about-

Wayne: We're- We're changing the name of the podcast to Walker Texas Podcast.

[Baaulp laughs]

Gir: Alright, great. Thanks for having me, uh, it's been an honor. 

Wayne: We're gonna be talking about Texas, we're gonna be talking about current events, did you SEE what happened at Cane's fried chicken? It was crazy. 

Log: Damnnn, which one?

Wayne: The one in Texas.

Trog: We're gonna be talking about Texas Instruments, we're gonna be talking about calculators...

Wayne: I heard Big Tex took a step.

Trog: Yeah he did, he started walking away.

Wayne: [laughing] He started walking!

Trog: Yeah, they had to chase him down.

Log: He got tired of having to wait!

Wayne: [laughing] There was no fair this year, so he was mad.

Trog: You get to see Big Tex in person, eventually.

Wayne: I can't wait! I can't wait.

Baaulp: We all know that Texas architecture and infrastructure is set up like the Protoss from StarCraft where there needs to be a Cane's fried chicken every once in a while or else, like, buildings don't work.

Gir: Is that true?

Wayne: [laughing] Its like pylons.

Baaulp: [laughing] Yeah!

Trog: Fried chicken-based energy.

Log: You can see it happening in real-time, if the employees leave Raising Cane's, the drones all emass around it. No direction. 

[Baaulp laughs]

Baaulp: It's true! That's absolutely- [laughs]

Wayne: You know what they should do? They should put a 5G tower inside of Big Tex. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Oh yeah. You can be the-

Wayne: He should... He should transport data.

Gir: OHH, I see, Wayne.

Wayne: I want Big Texas Data.

Gir: You're looking to convert Big Tex into Big Tech.

Wayne: Ahahaha. Yeah! Yeah.

Log: We're looking for a new way to make sure that he burns down.

[Gir and Baaulp laugh]

Trog: Yeah, we're looking for ways to just guarantee that.

Wayne: Anyways. Welcome to the Where Do We Begin podcast, uh, which is the podcast where we talk about all kinds of things. How is everybody doing today? The day... what is the day that we're recording? It's March 27th. We all in good spirits, we all feeling strong?

Baaulp: Yeah! Monster Hunter came out yesterday. We're all having fun playing that.

Wayne: Life is good.

Trog: Do we have the stats? When was the last time we released a podcast? Cause I feel like it's been a long time at this point.

Wayne: That was going to be my next question.

Baaulp: Uhh, let me check, let me check the archive...

Log: Stats master Baaulp! Let's see it.

Baaulp: I finished editing the podcast and put it up January 18th. 

Trog: Okay.

Wayne: Damn, that was a while.

Baaulp: Yeah, that was a while ago.

Wayne: I feel like that's long, even for us.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I feel like a lot has happened.

Wayne: Oh, so so much! So much. Uh, the main- The core reason why it's been so long since a podcast was, as you heard from the beginning of this episode, I am now a cowboy! I live- I claimed my Texas stars, and I'm a Texas citizen. My address is- [laughs]

Gir: [laughs] Is now in Texas! 

Wayne: I was gonna say it, and then just have you cut that out. But-

Trog: Too dangerous. What if Baaulp forgets?

Log: [southern accent] 1900 Dead Dog Gulch, Revolver, Texas.

Wayne: [laughs] You can find me in the saloons, every day. Oil in my spurs-

Baaulp: Yeah, you know like, in most of the country, in most places its like, "Street" or "Avenue," and in Texas its like, "Gulch, Saloon, Stable-"

Wayne: Let me tell you, Texas is exactly like the cartoons. It is just like them. 

Baaulp: How many tumbleweeds have bumped into you?

Wayne: I see one every day. At least every day. I came here for the cowboy life, and I got it. My neighbors have been stocking me up, uh, my stable's full. I got a horse, I got horse reviver in case it dies when I'm on the road, I got-

Gir: In case Scorpy runs into it. 

Wayne: [laughs] Yeah! No, jokes aside, Texas has been great! I'm in a place of my own for the first time in my life. I'm fully self-sufficient, I'm loving it, it has been a lot of fun. But... GETTING here was not the easiest thing, and once I got here, things were not very smooth, and it was- uh... It's been a crazy couple months. 

Log: Yeah, I got trapped in a dirt hole.

Wayne: Mm-hmm.

Gir: Yeah. Let's recap everybody's biggest moments of the last few months. 

Wayne: And I'll go last.

Gir: You'll go last? Alright, who wants to go first? Who's had major changes happen?

Trog: I mean, its pretty much just Wayne.

Baaulp: Pretty much just Wayne. 

Gir: No, I'd- I had a little something. 

Wayne: What happened to you?

Gir: Uh, I went on a little vacation, 

Baaulp: Oh, right! Oh shit. 

Log: It really has been a long time.

Gir: It was maybe an hour and a half after landing in the state of Tennessee, I was in my first car accident. 

Trog: Oh, right-

Wayne: Fuck-

Gir: Yeah. Which wasn't bad, it was like, run into a post, tire got fucked up, nobody got hurt. So... of all first accidents to be in, pretty good. Pretty fun.

Trog: Well, you know what they say. Everybody has to have a first car accident. 

Wayne: So how did YOU enjoy Tennessee? 

Gir: Uh, all I wanted was to leave that state. 

Wayne: I agree. I also spent some time in Tennessee, over the past- in the past few months. Um, but I'll get into that when it's my turn. Who's- Did anyone else? Who else has had eventful life moments?

Baaulp: Nothing happened. Been living my life as normal. 

Wayne: Trog, you got a couch. It's huge.

Trog: Yeah, that's great, no, I went to the store and I handed the person at the store my money and then they sent me a couch. It was very arduous, and I'm a better man for it now. I met God. 

[Wayne laughs]

Wayne: God sold me the couch!

Gir: Don't take this the wrong way, but I liked you before the couch. 

Wayne: This is God's couch. 

Trog: This is the future of Trog now. You better just get fucking used to it.

Wayne: You're sitting in the seat of Christ.

Log: Yeah, sit back and relax, enjoy the new age. 

Baaulp: I think between Gir and Wayne, like, you two have had momentous occasions for the rest of us. I- I just sat back, and y'know-

Wayne: Yeah, Baaulp sat back and watched as Gir slammed his car into the curb or whatever the fuck happened. Gir, so what happened? 

Gir: Uh, I wasn't driving. I will not name whomst was the driver. But between foggy, VERY foggy weather, I'd never seen fog so thick, unfamiliar mountain roads, poor road conditions, and a turn that suddenly came up without anyone realizing, we hit a turn too hard, tire rolled under itself and ripped itself apart, and we rolled into a fence. 

Wayne: Oh god. For some reason, I thougth another driver was involved. Like, another car. 

Gir: Nope, nobody else. It was just us, it was us and a cow field, and a fence.

Wayne: User error in extreme circumstance, yeah. 

Baaulp: You are so lucky that- like, you just walked away from that unscathed. 

Gir: Yeah, no, I got out and I was like, "Whew, well... alright."

Log: [???]

Baaulp: Yeah, pristine, untouched. 

Wayne: I've also got into car accidents, and never actually taken any damage myself.

Gir: That's when you knock on the wood. 

Wayne: Yeah, whenever- When I was like, a brand new driver in my not brand-new Honda Civic, and I backed into someone's car and fucking exploded the front of my car. I was totally fine, I didn't even get any whiplash. You got a little whiplash, right?

Gir: I was a little sore for a couple days, but otherwise I was totally fine. 

Wayne: Is that the only car accident you've ever been in?

Gir: Yep!

Wayne: How about the rest of you?

Trog: I've never been in a car accident. 

Wayne: Good! Keep it that way.

Log: I like... ran into a concrete wall, at like 2 miles per hour trying to park in a parking spot.

Baaulp: Whoa!

Gir: [laughs] WHOA! 

Wayne: [laughs] That's not an accident! That's just a scuff.

Log: Well, it caused damage.

Wayne: Yeah, that's true. Did you, like, squeeze the front of your car? 

Log: Uh, it knocked a part of the front out of place. 

Gir: Like it bumped the bumper? 

Wayne: The grill?

Baaulp: The closest I've ever been to an accident that could have been like, actual- That could have actually fucked it up... There wasn't anything driving, like, there wasn't an accident, it was just like- Some kind of like Final Destination-esque occurance that could have fucked me up, but didn't. So I'm pretty lucky. When I was in high school, I think one day my dad was driving me to school, and so it was just him in the driver's seat, me riding shotgun. And, up here in New England, like- during the winter, if it gets super super super cold, and like, the snow doesn't melt, they just have to remove it, right? They just have to get rid of it. 

Baaulp: And so there was this truck that was basically just loaded full of ice in the back, and it was not like a pickup truck, like a HUGE huge truck, the kinds that they bring to construction sites. It was just full of ice, cause they have to like, get rid of ice off of roads and stuff, and the sidewalk. And as my dad is driving past, a chunk of- GIANT chunk of ice slips off the back of that truck and, like- if it was a little bit to the left, it would have went through the windshield and hit my head. 

Wayne: Jesus.

Gir: Mmm. 

Log: How big was it?

Baaulp: It was big enough to probably put a hole in my head. 

Wayne: You think it would've broken the windshield and not exploded?

Baaulp: Absolutely. It was that big enough to go through the windshield. 

Log: Like, was it pointed? Cause if-

Baaulp: No, it wasn't like-

Wayne: Cause most of the time, the ice would explode and not your windshield.

Log: If it was just a flat slab, and it hit the flat part on a windshield, it would just break. 

Baaulp: It was long enough ago that I don't remember, but my dad, like, slammed on the breaks and we both were like, "Oh shit." Y'know. Cause it pretty much took, like- the side view mirror of my side off. Like if it was like- even the construction workers were like, "Whoa, you guys okay?" They like, stopped and checked in and everything.

Wayne: I have been in way too many car accident-type events in my life. There was one that I was talking about- I don't know if I've ever told the full story on the podcast, I'm not really sure. But yeah, I was a brand new driver, just got my license, probably had a couple months with the car, I don't really remember. Rainy day, I was driving to something, like a doctor's appointment, and I went down a hill, and there was a dude in front of me who broke short to take a turn, and did not, like, he did NOT wait. And he did it at the bottom of the hill, so I'm still going down the hill, and I try to brake, and it does not work because I'm driving a stupid, shitty Honda Civic. So I skid down the hill, and I slam into the back of him, and his car's, like, unscathed. My car is in a crumple heap. And I am 16 years old, or maybe 17, and I'm freaking out, and I'm just like, as I bump into that car, as I come to my senses and realize what's going on, I remember, "Oh god. No one has actually walked me through what I need to do in a car accident." Like, what to do involving the other driver, and what to do involving calling people. I only know what to do in a car accident based on what I've seen in, like, movies and shit. 

[Baaulp laughs] 

Gir: I mean, its true. I feel the same way. 

Wayne: So I slam into the back of this guy's car, and he just sits in his car for a while, he's not DOING anything. And then he gets out of the car and starts inspecting the damage, and I'm just sitting there like, "Oh shit. So I have to like, I gotta give him something. [snaps fingers] Insurance!" And at this point, I didn't even fucking know what my car insurance was, like, my parents were handling everything. So I'm like, I gotta give him something from the glove box, and- He comes over to the car and just kinda looks at me through the window, and I'm like, "Oh my god man, I'm so sorry, like- With the rain, I couldn't do anything, you stopped a little short-" I don't think I accused him of anything, cause I was like fuckin stressed as fuck.  

[Trog laughs] 

Wayne: I did NOT have the willpower to accuse this man. And I say all this shit to him, and I'm like, "Do you have, like, an insurance... something to give me?" And he says nothing, he just stares at me, with just a confused look on his face. And I'm like, "Okay, I'll give you something." And I go over to the glove box, and I look through all I have, and I'm like uhhh... And I pull out my Triple-A card, which is NOT what you would use in this situation, your Triple-A card is like a debit card that you use to pay for, like, roadside assistance. I go out the window, and I show him the Triple-A card, like, "Can you get some information off of this? I don't know." And he takes it and he looks at it, he flips it over, he looks at the other side, he looks at me, he goes over to his car and I'm like, "Okay, he must be getting something of his own. We're like, exchanging cards, that's what we do here." And he gets into his car, and he drives away with the Triple-A debit card. And I was just dumbfounded, my jaw dropped like... what. What do I do. 

[Baaulp laughs] 

Gir: You just got fuckin robbed? 

Wayne: What do I d- Well not really! Cause you can't- like, he couldn't do anything with that, but he just took the Triple-A card and drove away. 

Trog: That IS weird that that person would just take the card, though, like- I feel like like that kind of shows that he also didn't know what to do. 

Log: [crosstalk, laughing] He didn't know either! 

Wayne: [laughing] Which honestly makes me feel better in the post-mortem. 

Baaulp: He was winging it as much as you were, he was like- "Oh. This COULD be a robbery. I guess I just stole a thing." 

Trog: Exactly.  

Wayne: [laughing] And then after that, the story doesn't end there. After that, I'm just left in the road with like a crumpled hood, and like, my car is still running, it seems to be okay. 

[15:00] 

Wayne: But I'm like, what do I do? Do I call someone, do I need to get towed away? I can still drive. And there's a guy who's walking down the road, and he just happens to walk over and be like, I rolled down my other window and he's just like, "Man! Your shit's fucked!" And I'm like, "Oh, I know." He's like, "Yeah, I'm a mechanic." I'm like, "What do I do? I'm sixteen and I'm scared!" And he's like, "You need to get this shit home before it starts smoking or you're gonna DIE." And I'm like WHAT?? 

[Everyone laughs] 

Gir: What the fuck, dude.  

Trog: Why would he say- this person is NOT a mechanic. That person just was lying to you. The world doesn't work like fucking GTA! 

Wayne: He was in- He was in his uniform, though! Like he basically said like, you need to drive, if that thing starts smoking, get out of the car and like, move away from it.  

Trog: Obviously!  

Wayne: And I was like, "OH FUCK!" And I drive this like, crumpled, destroyed, decrepit car home. And I come to my parents and I'm like, destroyed, I don't even know how to explain to them what just happened. Now its like- Uh, at least within my immediate family, it is a- That is one of the family funny stories you tell about the time that Wayne gave away his Triple-A debit card thinking that it did something in an accident.  

Baaulp: That reminds me of a similar story of just, like- Person who's new at something, and is just, like- doesn't know what to do, and just- just fucks up massively because of it. Right after I got to college, I didn't move anywhere for college, I lived in Boston, I went to school in Boston, went to a college in Boston. But I ran into one of my old, like- he wasn't like a friend, but one of my old classmates from high school, I just ran into him on the train. So we were shooting the shit, and he's like, yknow, during orientation, everyone's new, right? Everyone's a freshman, everyone's new. He's like, "Yeah, I can tell that some people are just not used to like, being in an urban setting or anything. Or quite frankly, even being in a room full of a lot of people." Because like, during orientation, he saw one girl use an iPad- This was like, 2011, so iPads were like hot shit, right? It wasn't like there were a lot of tablets ont he market. This is like, the best tablet. These shits were expensive. And she's just like, "Oh, I have to use the restroom. Can you hold on to this?" And she just hands it to a stranger! And the stranger just like, looks at her, and looks at the iPad that has been forced into his hands, and like- She goes to use the restroom, and the guy's just like, "Oh, okay. I'll just pivot this into a theft." And just walks away!  

[Trog and Wayne laugh]  

Baaulp: He just walks away with it!  

Gir: Oh my god.  

Trog: Well, I guess that's one way to learn that lesson is, don't trust strangers with your valuables?   

Wayne: On one hand, you're testing that person- Like, in the stranger's situation, you're testing that person's, like, facial memory at that point.  

[Baaulp laughs]  

Wayne: If she comes back, and there's no iPad, you know who stole it. Unless he just put it down and someone else took it, which also could equally- is just as likely to happen.   

Baaulp: [crosstalk] That's true.   

Trog: I feel like what happened was that person that went to the restroom, this is like a fish-out-of-water scenario, that person was pulled from a fairytale land into our world, and doesn't understand our Earth customs. And they just thought, like- "Oh yeah, I can just trust everybody, cause I'm from Cinderella land!" And then just gave away their iPad.   

Wayne: Yeah, living a Hallmark movie.  

Log: Apple Cinderella land, with iPad.  

Trog: Yeah, with iPad. [laughs]  

Wayne: She knows what iPad is, she's from Cinderella but Apple.   

Baaulp: Does Snow White get the iPad?  

Gir: He was set up. That was a set up if I ever heard one.   

Trog: Maybe. Maybe that person was recording a YouTube video like, "Can I get people to STEAL from me by seeming stupid?"  

Gir: He walked away, and then like, five minutes later he got tackled by security.   

Wayne: You gotta help me, I don't understand anything! I'm from the world of Seinfeld but there's iPads! I don't understand this place!  

Baaulp: It just- It's just the funniest part about that story is like, you forcing valuables onto a stranger. [laughs]  

Trog: You're just literally testing them, like "WILL you steal from me? It's up to you! I'm putting it in your hands, you can steal from me right now."  

Wayne: "I gotta go to the bathroom... Hey, can you hold this?" I pull out my wallet with obviously a thousand bucks sticking out of it.  

[Trog laughs]  

Wayne: "Why do you want me to hold this?" "I might- What if I pee on it? I don't wanna get it dirty.  

Gir: [laughing] What if I pee on it!  

Log: Can you hold onto these jewels for me real quick?  

Baaulp: Yeah, you wanna hold these jewels?  

Trog: I got this big cartoon bag of money with a big dollar sign on it, and its too heavy, can you hold it for me?   

Wayne: Ohh, oh I'm so sorry about backing into your car, here's my social security card and my birth certificate. [laughs]  

Log: Watch my gold brick for me, please!  

Trog: Don't use this for any bad stuff!   

Wayne: [laughs] Can you hold this cursed amulet while I take a shit?  

[Baaulp and Wayne laugh]  

Gir: Can you go ahead and keep my car seat warm while I go do some push-ups?  

Trog: Take my broadsword.  

Wayne: [laughs] The keys are in there, just so you know.  

[20:00]  

Gir: Yeah, the keys are in there to help keep it warm.  

Log: I'm not allowed to take Masamune in here, can you hold onto it?  

Wayne: [laughs] I can't fit it in the door!   

Gir: I need to go practice my nunchucks.   

Trog: In the bathroom.  

Wayne: Wait, what- like, what are you giving me? You just said what you're gonna do, what am I doing?   

Trog: You're holding his OTHER pair of nunchucks. Cause he can't use three at the same time.   

[Wayne laughs]  

Gir: [laughs] Taking me life.   

Wayne: So yeah! Any other- any other life events? Or can I get into the Texas hour?  

Baaulp: Yeah! Let's start talking about Texas, what do you think about Texas so far? Or what happened in Texas? Or what's been happening.  

Wayne: Well, I was thinking more, talking about the life events, not so much like my time in Texas, but the fact that I moved and what happened.   

Gir: [crosstalk] The epic journey.  

Wayne: I promised on stream that I would talk about- Yes, the epic journey, the 1,600 miles from Conneticut to Texas. Um, it was fucking something. So, yeah. Around early January, I started planning my move, and I was thinking, like, "Yeah, I wanna get this done as soon as possible. I wanna get out of here." And my goal was- I think initially I was like, "Yeah I'm gonna pull off some fuckin Superman shit and I'm gonna get moved out by like, middle of February."   

Wayne: And, um- Wait, but I actually did that... That is what I managed. Okay, so- Hey, I did some Superman shit, I moved within a month!    

Wayne: So yeah, early January I started packing, I started looking for places, and I took a fuckin gamble. I picked a house, a rental house, I don't actually own a house yet, I'm not THAT well-off. I picked a rental house, and I was gonna do like, a virtual tour of the place, but then they offered me like, "Hey we'll knock your rent down by a hundred bucks if you just agree to the lease now, cause we need to fill it in." And that also, like, lowers your chances of someone else taking it-   

Baaulp: [crosstalk] You got SO lucky, you got SO lucky...   

Wayne: Well... well... we'll get into that, if that was lucky or not. For the most part, its lucky. So I was just like, yknow what, these pictures are fuckin awesome, this place seems dope in all these ways, I'm just gonna go for it. I'm gonna take the $100 rent reduction, I'm gonna take my chances. I had a video of someone walking through the house, that was ALL I had. I didn't have Trog come and check it out, I didn't go there myself, I just fuckin gambled. And I took that gamble, and then I proceeded to, like, continue. I got a- I had to figure out what I was gonna do to move all my shit down here. I went with- Originally, I was gonna pay for a moving service, but it was way too fucking expensive for what I wanted to do, so I cut back on a few of my things, I left my desk and my bed behind, and I got like a U-Haul hitch.    

Wayne: So, I went on a 1,600 mile road trip with a trailer in tow, and it was an experience. I was super stressed about the idea of towing the trailer behind me, but honestly, save for backing up, oh my god- I don't know how big rig drivers do what they do. Like, having something in tow just makes driving 50% more confusing whenever you're trying to do anything that's not just like, driving or turning left and right. Um, the road trip was fun, honestly! I brought my bird with me, he was riding shotgun in a big travel cage that I bought for him. He did pretty good, he was happy for most of it, there were a few times where he got exceptionally angry, but other than that, like- We had a few arguments on the road, I don't even know what happened.    

[Everyone laughs]   

Wayne: He- He was like, not happy at one point with, like, the way I was handling his cage. Like, trying to keep him steady and keep him buckled in and all that. At one point, he just like- would try to bite me anytime my hand got near the cage, and I couldn't figure out exactly what had pissed him off, and he wasn't taking any treats, so I had to go into the cooler and get out an apple and bite off little chunks of it for him while I was driving, and feed him those. The apple mended our relationship pretty well.   

Trog: [crosstalk] Nice.   

Log: He saw the Bass Pro Shop pyramid, and he perceived it as a threat.    

Wayne: [Laughs] This was- Was this pre or post-Bass Pro Shop pyramid? It was the same day.    

Gir: Wait wait wait wait, you got to the pyramid?   

Wayne: Yeah, I drove right next to it!   

Gir: You motherfucker!   

Wayne: My route literally had me like, on the- There's a highway that runs right in front of it. Um, it was a 2-day trip, 1,600 miles in two days is kind of difficult, it was 12 hours the first day, and 14 hours the second day.    

Baaulp: Oof-   

Wayne: I could've broken that up into three days, but I am an impatient motherfucker, and I was like, I wanna be there as soon as possible.    

Log: In reality, you really couldn't have, because of what is to come.   

Wayne: Yeah! Because of the way things went, and the way mother nature treated this country. I stopped in a hotel at the moment I got in Tennessee. I think the town was like, Kingsport or something like that. It was a La Quinta, and it was like- If you know what a La Quinta is, its like, the most basic, run-of-the-mill kind of hotel.   

Gir: [crosstalk] Hit-or-miss.   

Wayne: It's not like a motel, like a shitty road-sided motel-   

Gir: It is a step above a motel.   

Wayne: Yeah, its a step above a motel, but- It's okay. Well, I thought it was okay, there was something I realized WAYYY down the line that made me re-think my opinion of my stay at that place, but it was nice! It was fun- That was the first time in my life that I'd ever stayed in a hotel, totally alone. Just by myself. I've never been in a situation outside of that where I've like, bought my own hotel room and not been with like, family or friends or anything like that. The next day, I drove out, and that is when my adventure through the state of Tennesee began, and I realized how much I fucking hate Tennessee. If we have any viewers in Tennessee, I'm sorry, but unless there's a spot that, like, they didn't show me, I think your state sucks shit.   

Baaulp: You drove through the whole state, pretty much.    

Wayne: Yeah! Yeah. I literally drove the length of Tennessee to get to Texas. It's just depressing. Like, nature-wise it was depressing, I just kept seeing the same billboard for like, some country restaurant with some old lady on it, its just the same-    

Gir: [crosstalk] Ah, you saw that bitch too? [laughs]   

Wayne: It made me question advertising. Yeah! I mean, I dunno who she was, I won't make assumptions, but like- It made me question advertising. Specifically billboard advertising. Why would someone pay for for three billboards in a row, right next to each other, with no exit separating them? Like, the exact same billboard. If there were, like, on-ramps on the highway, in between those three billboards, it would make me think like, "Okay yeah, people are gonna get on the highway, they're not gonna have seen the previous ones..." No, it's just like, in case you didn't look the first couple of times, it's rediculous! It makes me wonder how easy it is and how cheap it is to get billboards in the middle of bum fuck nowhere. And it makes me think we need to do that.

[intro song plays (0:00-27)]

Wayne: Where do we begin? I’m Wayne.

Trog: I’m Trog.

Logmore: I’m Log.

Gir: [chuckles] I’m Gir.

Baaulp: Aaah, I’m so tired. I’m… I’m tired Baaulp.

Wayne: [crosstalk] I wanna be Baaulp now. I wanna be Baaulp.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I’m so sleepy.

Trog: I know this is already some… some great audio.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Can I be Baaulp… now?

Log: [crosstalk] Wait your turn, I’m Baaulp now.

Wayne: But - I called it. I got dibs on his name.

Gir: [crosstalk] He did get dibs on his name.

Trog: [crosstalk] You can have my turn.

Wayne: Log, you don’t have enough letters. I have just enough letters to be Baaulp.

Baaulp: I wanna be Log.

Log: I think you have too few letters.

Wayne: I mean, just subtract one of the As. There’s two As, one of them is unnecessary.

Log: One of them’s useful and one of them’s also useful. So—

Wayne: I mean… what else… what does Baaulp sound like with only one A, Baaulp?

Baaulp: Bah-lp.

Gir: Baah-lp. [laughs]

Wayne: Bah-lp.

Gir: Baah-lp.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I dunno—

Wayne: [crosstalk] Is it more of a “Bolp” like a, like a, like a O-sound? A “Bolp”?

Trog: [crosstalk] No, then it would be an O.

Wayne: Bolp.

Gir: Baah-lp.

Log: Yeah. So… we’ve asked “Where Do We Begin?” I suggest we begin with a little bit of controversy. In… the world of gaming. And gamer.

Gir: Better be good.

Trog: Okay.

Log: Yeah—

Wayne: [crosstalk] I don’t partake myself.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Randy… Randy Pitchford cut off both his thumbs.

Log: Yeah—

Wayne: Yeah, and it’s very controversial. No one wanted him to do it.

Log: Isn’t it great? He cut off his thumbs. Live. And he put it on Twitter. And the president reblogged it and said “that’s great.” [pause for laughing] But no. I’m gonna say… I’m gonna say something real now.

Trog: That wasn’t real?

Baaulp: Oh no.

Log: Ah, yeah, you got me. I let… I let it slip out.

Wayne: We don’t lie on this podcast. Please don’t lie again.

Log: Randy Pitchford still has his thumbs, sorry, guys.

Trog: Damn.

Log: Anyways, today, Capcom dropped a brand new track promoting their game, Devil May Cry 5. It’s Dante’s battle theme. And it was written by, like, I dunno, Cody Buchanan or something. And featured… and featured some screamo band called Suicide Silence. So the thing is that, it was really, really bad. So bad, in fact, that, at this point in time, which I think is seven hours after they originally posted the video, it is now taken off of their channel. And, unbeknownst to us at the time, their GamesCom trailer featured a little clip of the song at the part where Dante showed up and started hitting things with his weaponized motorcycle. Right now, at Tokyo Game Show, they showed the same trailer again and now the song is removed from that part of the trailer and replaced with, just, the Devil Trigger song that everybody knows.

Wayne: How bad could it be?

Log: It’s really bad, Wayne.

Trog: I didn’t listen to it.

Log: I tried to describe it as, like, “It’s a screamo song but imagine it’s… you’re listening to an instrumental of something on the radio and somebody in the room with you is yelling at you.”

Wayne: Can we listen to it now? And then come back?

Trog: No, you can’t, ‘cause it got taken off of YouTube!

Baaulp: Yeah, it was so bad—

Gir: It got taken… it’s gone.

Wayne: Did no one re-upload it?!

Gir: No.

Log: It’s re-uploaded somewhere. I don’t know—

Wayne: Let’s see if I can find—

Log: It’s called “Subhuman”, by the way.

Wayne: Yeah, I’m just finding, like, Devil May Cry Dante fan—

Gir: Yeah, see, their first mistake was letting a screamo band do something in the year 2018.

Wayne: Oh. Cody Matthew Johnson?

Log: Yeah.

Wayne: Found it.

Baaulp: Oh, his real name was Cody? Wow. Okay. I thought you were just making a joke calling him “Cody Buchanan”. But—

Log: Yeah. I… I remembered Cody.

Wayne: Oh my GOD.

Gir: Is it bad?

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: Live review. Here it is. WayneRadioTV’s live review of that shitty Devil May Cry 5 song.

Gir: Won’t date this at all when you hear it next year.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: You know, I told… I said what the title of the song is. I imagine it’ll still exist millenniums from now.

Wayne: Oh… Why—

Gir: Wow, this is bad.

Wayne: Okay, okay. We’re back.

Trog: Baaulp, can you throw in, like, the song underneath all of us talking right here?  

Baaulp: Yeah, sure.

Wayne: Well, you won’t wanna do that, ‘cause you won’t be able to listen to the podcast anymore because it was that bad.

Trog: [crosstalk] Oh no.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Okay, I won’t.

Wayne: That guy doesn’t sound like he should be doing screamo.

Log: Yeah, I’m pretty sure that these guys are, like, old. I… I can describe… I think you can describe it was “boomer metal”. Or, like, “boomer screamo”. [pause for laughing] Because, yeah. It’s like an old guy. And he’s just yellin’. And it doesn’t sound like it belongs with the song. It sounds like he’s just like a person yelling to a song that already exists or something. It’s relatively slow paced comp… in… especially when you compare it to other Devil May Cry songs. And even the ones that are in the same game as this. Also, the lead singer… he recently apologized for sexual misconduct with a minor.

Trog: [crosstalk] Awesome.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Oh, nice.

Log: There’s that.

Wayne: We should cut off his thumbs.

Trog: Just like Dante! Dante had to do that in Devil May Cry 4. Don’t you remember the level where he had to apologize for sexual misconduct with a minor?

Gir: [talking under Trog] Ah, yes, the press release level.

Wayne: If you make a bad song, you lose your thumbs.

Trog: [crosstalk] That’s what happened to Randy Pitchford.

Wayne: [crosstalk] I’m gonna take ‘em.

Log: The great thing that wraps it all up is people looked on the website because they posted it on the official website too. And there was a description that went along with the song. The way it referred to things like Dan… Dante and Devil May Cry. People pieced it together that they made the song referring to the Ninja Theory Devil May Cry game as reference for what Devil May Cry is.

Trog: Oh yeah, they looked at the wrong game.

Log: Yeah.

Wayne: Whoa. So they hired people that don’t know about a video game to make this song about a video game.

Trog: Yep.

Baaulp: Okaaay. Here… Let’s hit up Google. Let’s Google search “Devil May Cry” and see what character we’re writing about. Oh, here he is. He’s a strapping young chap. That looks like—

Wayne: Oh… Dante—

Baaulp: Yeah. That looks like some weird French guy. Or whatever.

Gir: I guarantee they just opened the Wikipedia page for DMC. [pause] And were like “hmm, got it”!

Wayne: [singing] Dante. Devil May Cry. Killing demons. He’s such a cool guy.

Gir: [like a screamo vocalist] Fuck yoooouuu!

Wayne: I’ve already done a better job.

Log: Yeah. Yeah, Baaulp, whenever you’re editing this, just find any metal track and just put it behind that. [pause for laughing] And that’s… that’s the new Dante battle theme.

Wayne: It’s just a loop of that, oh my GOD. Please! Capcom! Please hire me!

Trog: While we’re on the… oh, are… are we done talking about—

Baaulp: [singing] Killing demons, eating pizza—

Wayne: [singing] Alriiiight! [stops singing] That’s the verse. Alright, here… there it is. It’s… can I sing it again?

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah. Go for it.

Log: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: Is that okay? Alright. It’s… uh… [singing] Devil May Cry… [stops singing] wait, dammit, I don’t even remember how it went. [pause] I already forgot.

Trog: Well. You know, easy come, easy go. It was such a good song that it just left your ears.

Wayne: [singing] Killing demons, eating pizza… Alriiiight. [stops singing] There we go.

Trog: Um—

Log: Yeah.

Trog: But… what I was gonna say was, while we are on the topic of video game controversies, I’d like to talk about one. And it is Nintendo’s… well, let’s just fuckin’ date this so hard anyway. This week, when we are recording this, today, actually, Nintendo released their online service that you pay twenty dollars a year or four dollars a month or whatever and you get to play online. Now… here’s where I’m at with this. I bought a Switch for one game. And it’s Monster Hunter. So, to me, this is a twenty-dollar-a-year Monster Hunter tax. If you want to play Monster Hunter online, you have to pay us twenty dollars. In addition to that, so that’s… that’s… that’s just a personal issue I have. You know, that may not be… that’s not the usual case, I’m sure, you know, lots of people like Splatoon and Smash Brothers and stuff. So that’s just a personal thing. Now here are… here’s the things that I think are dumb, that is a problem for everyone. Number one. So one of the things that the twenty dollars a month gets you, oh sorry, twenty dollars a year gets you is cloud saves, right? That was one of their selling points. “Oh yeah, we’re gonna have cloud saves.” Well, there’s two things with the cloud saves that I think are fucked up. Number one, they’re not going to let you do cloud saves for every game because they’re afraid of cheating. So that’s the first one. [crosstalk] So… certain games—

Wayne: [crosstalk] Uh oh. What… huh?

Trog: —will just not have cloud save capabilities.

Gir: I guarantee you Poke… the new Pokemon games won’t have cloud saving.

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Okay.

Trog: Yeah. So… so… there’s that. Number two. The, uh, interface, it does not save your cloud saves automatically. You have to manually tell it to cloud save every time.

Wayne: Ooh, oh, great.

Trog: So—

Wayne: Sounds like a very great service that I would like to buy.

Log: Yeah, I don’t know if I’ll ever pay for this Nintendo Online functionality.

Wayne: Wait, so, I heard something about third-party games not having to… you don’t have to pay for the online. Like, I heard Fortnite, you can play for free.

Baaulp: Yeah. That’s… That’s the exception that I know about.

Wayne: So what constitutes a third-party game at that point? Like… is… would Monster Hunter not be a third-party game?

Trog: No, no, no, I don’t think it’s confirmed that it’s third-party games, I think it’s possibly free-to-play games will not charge you for online.

Wayne: That makes sense. I mean… that makes sense.

Log: You’ll probably be able to play Warframe too.

Trog: Yeah, I’m sure Warframe and Fortnite will be free. But, anything that you have to pay money for, you have to pay more money for. Which doesn’t make much sense.

Wayne: I wish the, like, the Warframe port had full cross-play. Because I… I don’t really play Warframe that much anymore. 

Trog: I would actually attempt to get into that game. If it had cross-play.

Wayne: I would probably, like, Warframe, I find is a very brainless game. It’s… It’s very gormless. You have to play… like you… I… but because it’s a PC game, I have to have full-screen or whatever. I have to give all my attention to it. Like, I could play Warframe on my Switch and just, like, speedrun through dungeons and get that shit done. Dungeons or whatever the hell you wanna call ‘em. Now I… I heard someone… someone had told me the way it’s gonna work is you can like duplicate your online account like your PC account. And put that in your Switch save. But, from there on out, they’re split. So any progress you make on the Switch version, you’ll start from where you were on PC but you won’t actually get any of your progress—

Trog: [crosstalk] Right—

Wayne: [crosstalk] —Which I think is pointless. Like, because then… then, I’m only gonna play one or the other. You can’t… there’s no way you would play both. There’s no reason to play both. 

Baaulp: I mean, maybe you’re that into it. But Warframe is not one of those games where it’s like, “Oh yeah, time to grind for… for the same thing on two separate accounts.” [crosstalk] Like, thaaaat’s—

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, that sounds shit.

Wayne: [crosstalk] The way it works, no, it’s inherently… it does not work.

Log: You know, you said “gormless” and I stopped thinking about what you were saying immediately ‘cause I was just like… I was just thinking about Aris saying “gormless”. [pause for Wayne laughing] It’s really good. You know, “gormless” has been… It’s like a word has been saved from the grave. It’s like… it’s like they… it’s like somebody just ca—came in and gave “gormless” the kidney it needed to survive. ‘Cause like…

Wayne: I had never heard the word before this year.

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, exactly.

Gir: [crosstalk] Wait, are you serious?

Log: I used it sparingly whenever I would just, like, think about stuff. Just ‘cause I thought it was funny. But, now, you just have somebody super popular just saying that constantly and now it’s… now it’s a word that is alive and well. We’ve saved a… a English word has been saved.

Gir: Wayne, did you ever play Killing Floor?  

Wayne: Did I ever play Killing Floor?

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: Killing Floor 2?  

Gir: No, Killing Floor 1.

Wayne: Yeah, I love Killing Floor.

Gir: They fuckin’ say it all the time in that.

Wayne: Gormless?

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: I guess so? If Aris can give a kidney to an English word, I think we should do it too.

Baaulp: What word?

Wayne: Uh… 

Trog: Alright, yeah.

Wayne: Um… well, lemme look up “under-used English words.”

Trog: Yeah, do you know any—

Gir: [crosstalk] Jitney.

Trog: [crosstalk] —like, old words? ‘Cause I don’t.

Wayne: Bunkum. Which is… which means rubbish or nonsense.

Trog: [crosstalk] What is it?

Log: [crosstalk] Hey, you have to put some thought into this. It has to be a word worth saving.

Wayne: It’s gotta be a good word, I know. Other words that are not used too often. “Dragoon.”

Trog: Well—

Baaulp: That’s a good one.

Trog: Yeah, but… isn’t that a very specific… term?

Wayne: “To compel by coercion.”

Trog: Really? That’s what “dragoon” means?

Wayne: Apparently? I… I mean, every time I hear “dragoon”, I imagine, like, a cool knight. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, I imagine like, a… like some kind of weapon.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Like a big-ass— [unintelligible] 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] —Final Fantasy.

Wayne: Yeah, I imagine a Final Fantasy dragoon.

Log: Can we—

Trog: What about the Kirby dragoon? [crosstalk] Kirby Air Ride.

Log: [crosstalk] Can we make “tarnation” a normal word?

Wayne: I think “tarnation” isn’t that obscure of a word. [crosstalk] I think that’s—

Log: [crosstalk] Well, it’s—

Gir: [crosstalk] It’s really not.

Log: The thing is… the thing is it’s not really obscure, but you will never say it unless you’re trying to—

Wayne: [crosstalk] To do a cowboy voi—

Log: [crosstalk] Be… unless you're trying to be a cowboy.

Wayne: And that's the thing. That’s where that… that… that word already got its kidney. From cowboy stereotypes.

Log: Alright.

Gir: I think we… we should spread… spread the good word of “good morrow” to the world.

Log: How about we expand it out to phrases? “Good morrow” can be one. But think about… ah… something I thought about today is… just bring back referring to just, like, a sum of money as “coin”.

Wayne: That’s… that’s a good one.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] But who uses coins anymore?!

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, how much coin ya got? 

Wayne: Hey, hey, I found another one—

Log: Yeah, you just… go to Walgreen’s. Uh… you buy… uh… some chewing gum and, like, a bag of chips and bring it up to the counter. And… the cashier says “Ye can have this… pack of gum and bag o’ chips, if ye got the coin.”

Baaulp: Okay, okay.

Log: They don’t tell you the price anymore, you have to pay up.

Baaulp: Ah… okay. That works, but only if we… deflate the currency because… you say that because you can actually pay for those items with coins, which we can’t anymore.

Wayne: But it doesn’t have to be literal. 

Log: Yeah— [crosstalk] you just… it’s— 

Trog: [crosstalk] But it should be literal.

Log: Everything is “coin” now.

Wayne: “You got the coin?” You’re like… you’re… you’re… you’re selling dime bags and you ask people if they got the coin. That would be great.

Trog: Can I throw in my, uhhhh, my suggestion for something that we should start using more?  

Wayne: Yes. 

Trog: Using the term “Sam Hill” to mean, like, “Hell.”

Gir: [crosstalk] What in Sam Hill—

Wayne: [crosstalk] What in Sam Hill— [laughs] That’s a good one. That is a good one. I found some other English words that are not very well used. Uh… “obambulate”. Which—

Trog: [crosstalk] O-kay.

Wayne: [crosstalk] —seems to be a word that me… it means “to walk about”, but “obambulate” just sounds like something somebody would say about Obama. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah—

Log: [crosstalk] It’s a unique Obama move. 

Gir: “To speak as though you were Obama.”

Wayne: It’s an Obama verb.

Trog: It’s his super.

Wayne: “Man, you really obambulatin’ right now.” In, like, in reference to someone acting like Obama. 

Gir: You know, Trog, I… I can’t agree with “what in Sam Hill”. That just… that just makes me of a teacher that caught me swearing.

Trog: Oh no. Well—

Wayne: “You should say ‘Sam Hill’ instead of ‘fuck’.”

Trog: How are you not in jail still?

Gir: Huh?

Trog: How are you not in jail still for swearing? They let you out?

Gir: Oh, I’m out on bail.

Wayne: He is. We’ve only ever talked to this man through a computer.

Baaulp: They didn’t cut off your fuckin’ tongue?

Trog: [crosstalk] They didn’t chop your thumbs off?

Wayne: [crosstalk] They didn’t cut off your thumbs?

Gir: No, I grew a new one.

Baaulp: Ohhh.

Wayne: A new thumbs?

Gir: Yeah, I got a new thumbs.

Wayne: Oh.

Baaulp: I want “supper” back.

Trog: [crosstalk] People say “supper.” 

Wayne: [crosstalk] “Supper’s” not comin’ back. “Supper” died.

Gir: [crosstalk] I’ve always had supper. I say “supper!” I say “supper.”

Wayne: Yeah, ‘cause you’re a fucking crazy-man.

Gir: You’re a— you’re a damnable bitch.

Trog: Hey, you know what… you know what my grandpa says? My grandpa refers to all toilets as a “commode.” Do you know anybody that does that?

Log: My grandma does the same thing.

Trog: That must just be, like, an old person thing.

Gir: “I gotta go to the commode.”

Log: I think… I think that’s like a… it’s like a Texas virus that you get when you’ve been here too long.

Trog: That could be it. 

Log: Well, it’s—

Trog: Well, no, my grandpa’s from the northeast. So, I don’t think— [crosstalk] —it’s strictly Texas.

Log: [crosstalk] Yeah, but… but did he come down here?

Trog: He did eventually.

Wayne: I got an under-used word for you. We, this group here, we’re a “concinnity.”

Trog: Alright, what does that mean?

Wayne: It means “the skillful and harmonious arrangement or fitting together of different parts of something.”

Log: Well, that… I don’t give a fuck about that word.

Wayne: HEY. How about a “flapdoodle?!”

Trog: Alright… what’s that one?

Log: Mmm, I dunno about that one.

Baaulp: I hate this segment. Can we— [crosstalk] —move on?

Wayne: [crosstalk] I hate that one too! Because it sounds like what a four-year-old would say about somethin’.

Gir: About a butthole.

Trog: But what is it?

Wayne: That sounds like a… that’s a ToonTown word right there.

Trog: That’s my new username.

Baaulp: Can I… can we move on? I hate this segment. 

Wayne: Yeah, let’s… let’s… let’s obambulate to a new segment.

Trog: No, I like this segment. 

Log: Alright… [Baaulp groaning] alright, what sound does that make?

Wayne: Uh… [making weird noises]

Gir: [making weird noises]

Log: Alright, we’re in the new segment.

Trog: Alright, Baaulp, what’s your amazing segment that’s so great that we have to stop talking about funny words?

Baaulp: I just wanted to move on but I… I can say a funny story.

Wayne: And I want you to go. Out of here.

Baaulp: Okay.

Wayne: So let’s talk about another word—

Trog: [crosstalk, laughing] Let’s just go back.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] O… o… okay. Okay. Wait, hold on, lemme leave. [makes pitter-patter noises]

Wayne: He’s obambulating! [crew laughing] He’s outta here!

Trog: See? The bit’s eternal, we can’t leave the bit. [crosstalk] It’s not done, the bit’s not over.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Oh nooooo…

Wayne: Baaulp’s a rapscallion, we don’t need him.

Trog: [crosstalk] “Rapscallion” isn’t… that unusual.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I want my supper.

Wayne: Yeah, “rapscallion” isn’t dead enough, I feel like I still hear that.

Log: Have ye done all yer lessons, Baaulp?

Baaulp: Uh… no.

Log: Alright.

Wayne: Well, go do your lessons!

Baaulp: When I was a kid, I learned multiplication through a Pokemon exercise book. 

Trog: Nice.

Wayne: I had that book!

Baaulp: You did?!

Wayne: I think… yeah, I think I did.

Baaulp: They… they were split up into different grades of math like, you know, like school grades. And, uh, that’s how I learned multiplication, I think. 

Gir: Man…

Wayne: I had… oh… no, for some reason, I’m getting it mixed up with something else. I had, like, a plastic square with, like, keys on it. Like, it was just keys with, like, a math problem on it. And you would press in the key and when you pressed the key down, it would, like, the… the button was, like, translucent and it would, like, display the answer. Like, through the button.

Baaulp: Ohhhh, no, no, it wasn’t that fancy. Like, I—

Wayne: I mean, it wasn’t fancy. It was a cheap lil piece of shit.

Baaulp: It was like… now that I think back on it, it was so, like, excessive. Different companies were just getting the license to use Pokemon and were just… probably just re-skinning their existing products with Pokemon. So, like, as a kid—

Wayne: Pokemon Campbell’s. Chicken noodle.

Baaulp: Yeah. I had Poke… I had Pikachu Band-Aids when I was a kid.

Gir: I had a Pikachu stapler.

Wayne: I understand Pikachu Band-Aids. Put a Band-Aid on and it’s like “Oh yeah, Pikachu healin’ my wounds. [crosstalk] Thank you, Pikachu.” 

Trog: [crosstalk] Electrocuting my wounds.

Baaulp: I wanted that. And the box of Band-Aids came with a Pokemon Pikachu fridge magnet. So—

Trog: Aww, shit.

Wayne: Yeahhh! That’s awesome, you can look at that. I don’t understand, like… [Baaulp laughing] Pokemon food, though. Because you—

Baaulp: Did you just say—

Wayne: Sure—

Baaulp: Hold up, I’m sorry, did you just say, like, “oh yeah, a fridge magnet, you can look at that?” Like I’m gonna—

Wayne: Yeah!

Baaulp: —go to my kitchen and stare at my fridge and go— [crosstalk] “Look at all these magnets.”

Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah! That’s what you did as a kid! [crosstalk ends] What else did you do with it? Not look at it? You just wasted your fucking magnet of Pikachu? But… here’s what I’m sayin’. You got Campbell’s Pokemon noodles. It’s… nothing’s different. Like… like, I don’t get it ‘cause it’s like… what do you do? Do you pretend the Pokemon are havin’ a little duel… battle in your soup? 

Trog: Yeah, and then you eat ‘em.

Gir: You’re a fucking kid, you go “Hey, mom! Mom! Look! It’s Pikachu!” and then you eat it.

Wayne: “Mom, look, Pikachu’s in my soup! I’m ‘bout to kill ‘em!”

Gir: Yeah! Kids are fuckin’ dumb, they’ll like anything if it’s got a funny lil shape to it.

Wayne: Ugh, children are obstinate. 

Gir: That’s why I liked my fuckin’ Bulbasaur pencil sharpener. It was a pencil sharpener but it was also Bulbasaur. 

Trog: I had… uh… I had the Pokemon board game. And never learned how to play it. I just looked at all the pieces and was like, “Damn, these are cool pieces of cardboard.”

Gir: I had Pokemon Yahtzee.

Wayne: Well, enough of that caterwaul. Let’s talk about somethin’ else.

Baaulp: Nah… nah, nah, nah. What is, like, the weirdest Pokemon thing you ever owned?

Gir: Pokemon Yahtzee.

Baaulp: [chuckling] Pokemon Yahtzee.

Gir: Yeah.

Trog: What’s wrong with Pokemon Yahtzee?

Wayne: Yahtzee is the worst game.

Gir: Nothin’, but it’s weird for it to be Pokemon Yahtzee.

Trog: Is Yaht… wait, hang on—

Wayne: You just put some dice in a cup.

Baaulp: I had Pokemon Monopoly. I had… had the Pikachu Band-Aids. It’s all coming back to me now. I had, like, a rubber ball that was translucent that just had Mew in it. 

Trog: I think everyone had a toy like that as a kid.

Gir: You never fuckin’ used him?

Baaulp: Wh… What?

Wayne: I had a ball with Pikachu in it. One time, I took a bite of one of those balls.

Trog: No, you didn’t. [crosstalk] Bullshit.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] What?

Wayne: I did. I didn’t eat it.

Trog: Bullshit.

Wayne: I just did it because I was bored.

Trog: [crosstalk] Bull—

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Did you honestly manage to rip off a chunk?

Wayne: Yes! Yes, I ripped a giant chunk out of it.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Why?

Trog: [crosstalk] You ruined it then!

Baaulp: Why would you ruin your own toy, you bastard?

Wayne: ‘Cause I… I broke shit when I was a kid. I dunno why, I just did it.

Trog: Apparently so.

Wayne: I was the destructive kind of boy.

Gir: Wayne just likes to break shit.

Baaulp: I think the weirdest thing I did have was that… was going back… going back to the beginning… I think… I think the weirdest thing I did have was that Pokemon activity book because, like, it was just a book of math problems and, like, exercises and, like, lessons to teach you multiplication but, like, instead of the normal text being there, it was like… they’d have, like, a JPEG of, like, Ash telling you all the… how to multiply.

Trog: Sick.

Gir: I mighta been good at math if I had that.

Wayne: “Mom. I’ll learn math faster if Ash tells me how.”

Baaulp: Yeah.

Log: I had to learn multiplication out of dire necessity because there was a Mario Party mini-game that had math in it and I couldn’t win until I— [crew laughing] knew how to multiply.

Trog: Is there any skill to Yahtzee? Or do you just, like, get lucky?

Wayne: It’s how good you say “Yahtzee.”

Log: You have to be able to see what the dice say fast before Lil Jimmy picks up one of the die and throws it again. And you never know what your actual score is.

Trog: Now… I feel like that’s… probably not in the spirit of the game. But I haven’t played Yahtzee in maybe ten years so—

Baaulp: I’ve never played Yahtzee.

Gir: You’re not missin’ out.

Trog: Well, there’s dice in a cup—

Log: There’s no spirit to Yahtzee.

Trog: Which is worse - Yahtzee or Monopoly?

Wayne: Trouble is better.

Gir: Monopoly. [crosstalk] Monopoly sucks ass.

Trog: [crosstalk] See, I like Monopoly.

Wayne: Monopoly’s way better than Yahtzee. [crosstalk] Monopoly is fun.

Gir: [crosstalk] Fuck Monopoly.

Trog: I like Monopoly. Let’s do a stream where we, just, all get into, uhhh, VR Tabletop Sim and play an entire seven-hour game of Monopoly—

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Oh nooooooo.

Trog: [crosstalk] —from start to finish.

Wayne: We tried to do something like that and everyone was just like, “No, that’s a horrible idea.”

Gir: That is a horrible idea.

Trog: Well… I’m not somebody who would say that.

Wayne: Just playing Tabletop Simulator in general ‘cause we couldn’t think of a game to play.

Log: Yeah. That… you normally need to know what game you’re gonna play… to play it.

Gir: I just hate board games. All board games fucking suck to me.

Trog: [crosstalk] I like board games.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Hey, I agree with Gir. All board games… most, like, most—

Trog: [crosstalk] What’s wrong with you guys?

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Okay, like, tabletop games are fun. [crosstalk ends] Like the… the ones that are, like, a little more involved. But, like, generic board games like Monopoly and Yahtzee do… just… suck. They suck.

Gir: They’re fucking boring.

Wayne: Hey, motherfucker, you ever play Scrabble?

Trog: Well, here’s the thing, you… you can’t say all board games suck. [crosstalk] That’s like saying “all video games suck.”

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Scrabble sucks. 

Trog: There’s so many different kinds that there’s gotta be at least one that you—

Wayne: [crosstalk] I agree. 

Trog: [crosstalk] —would enjoy.

Gir: [crosstalk] Well, I haven’t encountered one that I could say “yes, let’s play it.”

Wayne: Hey. Hey, have you ever played “Break the Ice?”

Trog: Yeah. Dude, I… I had that game as a kid. [crosstalk] That game is sick.

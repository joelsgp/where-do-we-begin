[Intro music “Wild Winds of Home” by Yin Xia plays (00:00-00:28)

Wayne: The heat....the hot summer sun... beats down on us... and in my empty mind... a question echoes.... Where Do We Begin it's the first podcast of the summer baby! Welcome to Where Do We Begin, my name is Wayne.

Trog: I'm Trog.

Baaulp: I'm Baaulp.

Gir: I'm Gir.

Scorpy: Um, I'm uh- I'm-

Wayne: AND! 

Scorpy: Oph-. 

[A beat]

[Gir, Trog, and Baaulp laugh]

Wayne: AND!!!

Scorpy: I'm special guest-

Wayne: Our speci- [wheezes]

Scorpy: Uhh-

Wayne: Our special summer guest---???

[Baaulp and Trog laugh]

Scorpy: We've got-

Wayne: Who goes by ONE name-

[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

Scorpy: S- Scorpy-

Wayne: AND!!

Scorpy: And we- [Wayne laughs] my- my special guest appearance, Scorpy. 

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Woo! Welcome. 

Trog: They call him Scorpy the Summer Sprite because his appearance marks the beginning of summer. He's sort of like a- like an elvic entity. 

Wayne: The Solstice Sprite.

Scorpy: I'm more of a 7UP person. 

Wayne: Are you? Is anyone? 

Scorpy: Is that a thing? What's a summ- what i- what's a summer sprite?

Trog: I don't know, it's like a little gremlin that tells you if summer is going on. 

Wayne: No, it's nothing, this is a co- this is a new concept-

Trog: [Crosstalk] You guys've never heard of a summer sprite? Come on. 

Wayne: that Trog has created right now. [laughs]

Trog: Come on. 

Baaulp: That- that's not anything, Scorpy. 

Scorpy: I'm real worried I need to find out what that is. 

Wayne: Let me ask you this question, uh. Is there anyone on earth that prefers 7UP to Sprite? 

Baaulp: No?

Scorpy: Me, because 7UP-

Wayne: You said that, Scorpy, but are you telling a joke?

Scorpy: No! 

[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

Wayne: You really like 7UP more?

Scorpy: The 7UP logo has a lil' red ball on it. It's more interesting than the Sprite logo which is just like a-

Wayne: But you mean, you're talking about Cool Spot. 

Scorpy: Yeah. 

Wayne: He has a name. That's like a guy. 

Trog: [Crosstalk] Yeah be respectful. 

Wayne: [Crosstalk] I don't know why they like show his-

Scorpy: Oh shit, that's riiight! Oh they're the same!

Trog: You're being very disrespectful to the brand. We're sponsored.

Wayne: Cool Spot- you know- 

Scorpy: I'm so sorry 7UP

Wayne: It's kinda weird that Cool Spot always shows his ass to the camera, like his face is always facing away from the logo.

[Baaulp laughs] 

Trog: I think that just shows how 7UP is like the sexy soda, you know?

Scorpy: Is it an ass without a crack?

[Wayne and Gir laugh] 

Trog: That's.. a question contemplated by philosophers for years.

Wayne: That's a question for the AGES.

Scorpy: That's the question I brought, as special guest, that's what I w- wrote down, so.

Wayne: Is it an ass without a crack. I mean without a crack can it poop?

Trog: No.

Scorpy: Nope. 

Wayne: Cool Spot has a MOUTH. 

Scorpy: Unless it like seeps through the pores, like a-

Gir: That's a question that didn't need to be asked.

Wayne: Does he eat?

Baaulp: They still MAKE 7UP, right?

Scorpy: Yeah!

Trog: Yeah

Scorpy: I buy it!-

Gir: [sarcastically] No, they stopped. 

Trog: Scorpy sounds OFFENDED. 

[Scorpy and Wayne laugh]

Wayne: [imitating Scorpy] 'I buy it man, come on!' 

Baaulp: In the 90's and early 00's they were pushing 7UP so hard, to do like advertising campaigns and like I haven't- I don't think I remember the last time I've SEEN a 7UP ad. They like gave up. 

Trog: No, they sold it all. There's none left. 

Gir: They kinda did, they kinda just hope that you remember that they exist and that you just buy it when you're there. 

Scorpy: Yeah.

Wayne: 7UP to me was just the soda that my grandma bought. And didn't drink.

Baaulp: Yeah. 

Wayne I don't know why she bought it. 

Scorpy: Whaat? 

Baaulp: My parents would buy some- it would be one of those things where my parents would buy 7UP and they'd be like 'It's just as good as Sprite' 

Wayne: Sh- but like- it's not any cheaper, so w-why? Like it's not- it's not like it's a value brand, it's equally priced to Sprite.

Baaulp: You go to the supermarket and they have a sale on 7UP instead of Sprite, so you get 7UP instead and-

Wayne: I go to the soda aisle and I look to the right on the isle and see on the shelf 7UP and I see to the left of it Sprite and I say well I saw the 7UP first and I grab the 7UP

Gir: I personally don't. Care. I- I'll drink either one just as easily.

Wayne: I honestly think 7UP- it's not bad, but Sprite is better.

Trog: Wait, I was- I was in on the bit at first but are we actually saying that there is a difference in the taste between Sprite and 7UP? 'Cause I-

Gir: [Crosstalk] There's virtually none.

Trog: -disagree. I think they taste probably the exact same. 

Gir: [Crosstalk] There's virtually no difference.

Scorpy: I feel- I feel better-

Wayne: Taste test. Blind- o- do me a blind taste test on the next stream.

Trog: [laughing] You feel better?

Scorpy: I feel better drinking 7UP. 

Trog: So Scorpy is positing that there is not a taste difference but perhaps some sort of like spiritual link-

Scorpy: Yeah. 

Trog: that he personally shares with 7UP that makes him feel better. 

Scorpy: 7UP has scool- has Cool Spot.

Wayne: Sprite doesn't have a cool video game for the Sega Genesis.

Scorpy: Right?

Trog: That's true.

Scorpy: Sprite's boring as shit. 

Wayne: 7UP does.

Baaulp: Soooo should that be the audience question of the week? Go do a taste- go- uh you, listener, uh, go do- if you- if you want to, go do a taste test between Sprite and 7UP, and tell us which one you like... more. 

Trog: See- I think that's- you're gonna get biased opinions there, here's what I think it should be, go buy a 7UP, go buy a Sprite, take the labels off both of them, mix them up so that you don't know which one is which, and see if you can tell the difference. 

[5:00] 

Scorpy: Shake 'em.

Trog: That's scientific.

Wayne: Combine them in the same cup and see if you can tell the difference.

Trog: I- well- okay. I didn't say that.

Gir: The scientific thing to do, Trog, would be to dump it into a glass, like a completely unlabeled glass.

Scorpy: Nope. Because the glass will affect the taste. You have to get- 

Wayne: [Crosstalk] That's too hard. Yeah.

Scorpy: You have to get twelve- twelve can boxes.

Wayne: You gotta drink it from a golden spoon.

Scorpy: You have to get two twelve can boxes of each one. 

Baaulp: We all know they don't use uh, glass vessels in chemistry because it affects the chemicals. Yup that's- 

Gir: [sarcastically] Yeah exactly. 

[Baaulp laughs]

Scorpy: Yeah. Look- look at what happened to Mr. White

Wayne: Do you see what happens to glass under heat? It melts! 

[Baaulp laughs] 

Gir: Yeah. 

Scorpy: Yeah you don't want to do that.  

Baaulp: Right.  

Gir: Just like butter.  

Trog: And sodas are traditionally boiling hot, so.  

Wayne: I put a cold glass in hot water and it broke, so. 

Gir: You're telling me you've never had a cold Dr. Pepper?  

Baaulp: And we all know you can't boil things in- in glass vessels, either that's- they don't do that in chemistry.  

Scorpy: They don't. It- It'll break! 

Wayne: [Crossstalk] This is a beverage-cast 

Scorpy: It'll break!  

Wayne: You know, what better- what better topic for the summer, other than ice cold beverages. You know? 

Trog: Uh, I would say any topic as long as, it doesn't- 

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Ice cold! Ice cream. 

Trog: -go back into Polar Seltzer, 'cause we already did that bit last month,  

Wayne: [Crosstalk] What's your favorite-  

Trog: -so we can't do that again.  

Wayne: What's your favorite- what's- 

Baaulp: [Crosstalk] Yeah, we can't do this anymore.  

Wayne: What's your- what's your favorite summer treat? 

Scorpy: I don't like ice cream-

Trog: I just like ice cream.

[A beat of silence] 

Scorpy: Pft.  

Gir: Well that was immediate, huh? 

[Gir and Scorpy laugh]  

Baaulp: You know, Scorpy, I like Scorpy as a guest on the podcast because he's not in every episode, I think- 

Wayne: I like Scorpy too.

Baaulp: -this is Scorpy's second appearance, [Gir snorts] but I love all the conflict Scorpy brings, [Wayne laughs] and it's preemptive. Scorpy didn't say that as a reaction to Trog, Scorpy said it FIRST. Scorpy hates ice cream and THEN Trog said it.

Scorpy: Ice cream makes me feel high, I don't like it. 

Trog: Woah!

Gir: What??

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: What kinda ice cream are you eating??

Wayne: You're the one who says you enter like a s- like a special state after you eat more than one Oreo. You have a unique stomach. 

Scorpy: Yeah! Like after eating an Oreo I feel like I can feel it through my veins and I feel like hei-heightened.

Baaulp: Are you just like hypersensitive to sugar? Is that what it is?

Scorpy: Probably. I can have like- I'll have like one soda and I feel like- I feel like the 7UP running through my veins.

Gir: See faster.

[Trog laughs] 

Baaulp: I mean- I mean that's good for you, you- I mean like honestly we're the unhealthy ones, you have like the normal amount of sugar where you're-you're healthy. We're the unhealthy ones. 

Scorpy: Perhaps.  

Trog: So, I think as a- wuh- well now hold on, now before I change the subject did we get all- 

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Summer!! 

Trog: -the jokes out about drinks or do we wanna- do we wanna-

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Summer!!!!!!

Trog:-keep talking about drinks for a little while longer?

Baaulp: What?

Trog: 'Cause I- I can change the subject. But I just wanna make sure we got all the drink jokes out.

Wayne: No. I don't have anything else to say, but DON'T change the subject. 'Cause I'm gonna think of something. 

Trog: Alright, so the rest of this podcast will be about forty five minutes of silence. 

Wayne: Um. Uh. How many... ice cubes-

Trog: Alright, I'm- we're segueing

Wayne: - do you take in-

Trog: So- 

Baaulp: No, no, what-

Trog: It's good that we got Scorpy on this episode specifically because we just. Did something.-

Wayne: The SUMMER!!

Trog: We have, famed director, Scorpy, Socpens Bellinghausen, here, in the studio, to talk about his latest-

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Director of Summer. 

Trog: -directorial uh, work, uh, GameClam 2,

Scorpy: Yup! Jura- ope. Yeah that one. 

Trog: What- wait which one were you going to talk about?  

Gir: [Crosstalk] I thought it was GameClam Slim?

Trog: What have you been doing that I didn't know about-

Scorpy: Jurassic Park! I made a whole Jurassic Park film. 

Trog: What?? [Crosstalk]  That's cool.

Scorpy: Yeah. it's called Jurassic Park-

Wayne: Called Jurassic Studios.

Scorpy: -uh Summer Fun. 

Trog: I was just gonna talk about GameClam but if you wanna talk about Jurassic Park-

Wayne: [laughing] Jurassic World: Summer Fun?

[Wayne and Scorpy laugh] 

Scorpy: There's no- there's no death at all, the dinosaurs have fun, and the humans-

Wayne: The park like, works. [Baaulp laughs] The park functions as intended, nobody breaks out of the cages.

Scorpy: It's park footage, you know?

Wayne: It's just going to Universal Studios. Happily. 

Baaulp: For a moment I thought you were gonna say 'Oh yeah I made my own Jurassic Park film, it's called Jurassic World'

[Scorpy laughs] 

Scorpy: No. 

Trog: That would be crazy, if Scorpy was actually secretly the- the like, shadow director of Jurassic World I would like. That'd be awesome- 

Scorpy: I might as well have been!!! Cause- 

Wayne: [Crosstalk] Ghost directed it.  

Scorpy: -I wrote that shit.  

Gir: I'd question why you made such a bad film.  

Scorpy: No it was pretty good!  

Trog: I think that film was bad- 

Gir: [Crosstalk] I hated it.  

Trog: -unless Scorpy made it. And then it was great.  

Scorpy: Yeah that's my opinion on a lot of movies I watch. 

[Trog and Baaulp laugh]

Gir: Jurassic World put me to SLEEP. 

Trog: This is bad unless I was directly involved with it 

Scorpy: This is bad but if I made it, it would be good [laughs]

[Gir laughs] 

Trog: Yeah exactly. But yeah. Uh, the GameClam stuff that we did, at the time of this recording it was a week ago, we had to push this recording back, because we were all busy. uh.

Wayne: Can you believe it, folks, this is the second podcast that we have recorded on a predetermined schedule. 

Trog: It's crazy. 

Wayne: We are making new strides, we are becoming professionals.

Trog: Yeah. 

Wayne: And it's the first podcast of the summer. [laughs]

Trog: We're really making sure that we let everyone know that this is the first podcast of the summer.

[10:00]

Wayne: Woo!

Trog: Um, but yeah. I just- you know, I just wanna say that Scorpy, I really enjoy working for you, uh, however-

[Scorpy snorts]

Baaulp: Uh ohhhhh

[Gir laughs]

Trog: I do like how every time we do one of these things it's always like. A week before you want to do it, you're like 'What if we just like did this complex production-

[Scorpy laughs]

Trog: -and then just like did it in a week?'

Baaulp: It's not always a week, I think this one- so- the timeline that I remember is we were planning- we were like in the beginning stages of planning it, but then like, we stopped to actually watch E3, and then we got so many ideas from E3 that like so many things changed so it felt like we had a week to do everything.

Scorpy: Yeah it was like, we started- we started talking about stuff like, before-

Baaulp: Yeah. 

Scorpy: -all the E3 stuff and then, we just didn't do anything during E3 and then afterwards we changed a few things but.

Trog: [Crosstalk] Yeah we [laughs] kinda didn't. 

Baaulp: Yeah- and then- yeah we had so many ideas after we watched E3 that we were like we have to strike while the iron's hot so we had a week to do everything.

Scorpy: We saw the-the Devolver conference, and we're like here's things to avoid. 

Trog: See- okay-

Scorpy: Here's what we want to avoid! 

Wayne: Definitely when we do large productions we tend to uh, tend to work as close to the, the-the striking hour as possible. Uh, this one was a- was a whole new level of that, [Scorpy laughs] where like we had- we- we were finishing videos for the- for the conference- 

Trog: [Crosstalk] Day of, yeah.  

Wayne: -like, within the hour it was actually going to air. 

[Scorpy laughs] 

Wayne: The suit that I wore showed up like two hours before the show started. 

[Scorpy and Baaulp laugh]  

Trog: There was a lot of moving parts that were continuously in motion pretty much up until I wanna say, probably fifteen minutes before we actually went live- 

Baaulp: Before we hit the button.  

Scorpy: Yeah. I remember- I remember the greenscreen wasn't tested until twenty minutes before the show [laughing] and you found- and you found out it was reflecting the [laughs] the- yeah-  

Wayne: Well it was tested, just not with my suit! Just not with my golden suit. 

Trog: Yeah I wanted to talk about that, 'cause it's actually very funny, so. 

[Wayne laughs]  

Trog: This was the first time, Wayne has a pretty good greenscreen setup in his new place, and this was the first time where um, we could actually do a production where me and Wayne were in the same room together, um, 

Baaulp: Ooo. 

Trog: Which was pretty cool. Um, so we- we- he had the greenscreen all set up, I came over, I have like, my PC, I set all that stuff up, we test out the greenscreen- 

Wayne: Put it on the famous Peppers table.  

Trog: Yeah we like- [laughs] yeah it was on the Peppers table, which was cool, I felt like I was a part of history.  

Wayne: [laughing] It's riddled with holes and stains. 

Trog: Yeah, it was- 

[Baaulp laughs]  

Trog: I think- I think a production, you gotta just have some like really shitty nasty tech somewhere in there that's like, too- too outdated. But um, 

Wayne: Mhm.  

Trog: So we tested the greenscreen, and we're like, 'Oh wow, this-this actually looks great, like, with the lighting, and- and the.' Like, 'cause Wayne went from like the doing the greenscreen in his tiny ass bedroom back in Connecticut- 

Wayne: My old greenscreen setup was me taking a large metal pole, running it through the- the loop in the greenscreen, and then like I have it bolted to the ceiling with like fisherman hooks, [Trog laughs] the it- it was terrible. It was awful. I maybe had like six feet of clearance between where the greenscreen was and the computer and it was just- it was a nightmare. The- and we were basically like, we were doing it with the the worst possible setup, and making the best of it. And NOW, it's like much closer to a real professional setup.  

Baaulp: It's legit. 

Wayne: We have TONS of clearance, we have multiple white lights- three lights, for left, right, and middle.

Trog: [crosstalk] We could have TWO camera angles, even.

Wayne: [crosstalk] We, for, for ultimate shadow elimination. Multiple camera angles, uh, room to move. But...

Trog: But there was one very specific issue that neither me nor Wayne thought about or caught until it was already too late to fix it. 

[Wayne laughs]

Trog: Which is... to set this up Wayne had the idea to buy a solid gold suit for this character like, that was planned far in advance, right?

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Not, no, not real gold, it was like, you know, gold material.

Wayne: [crosstalk] No, solid gold. It's gold karat plated, yeah.

Trog: [crosstalk] You know what I mean. So Wayne wanted to wear a gold suit, which was a really good idea-

Wayne: I had the idea that the, that the Mr. White character experienced a glow-up, not from the sales of the GameClam 1, but [laughs] we had the idea that it would be through the earnings of slot machine games on the GameClam 2. Which is essentially a big fucking scam. 

Trog: [crosstalk] You saw some of that. Yeah.

Wayne: The uh, so we wanted to put him in like, I wanted to get a crazy-ass suit and put a gem on his head. And I, luckily found on sale at Kohls.com, a GOLDEN SUIT. 

Scorpy: [crosstalk] Shoutout.

Wayne: [crosstalk] I was like, "oh, this is perfect."

Trog: [crosstalk] Shoutout Kohls.

Wayne: The sizes were like... the sizes were uniform for the whole suit. Like it just gave me a number and said like, "okay this is the size of the suit" and it didn't corres- it only corresponded to the jacket, so I was just guessing whether or not the pants would fit. So I just ordered the one that I thought would work. And I most- it was a little tight but I mostly got it to fit. And then we got in front of the greenscreen, and I was a ghost. 

[Scorpy laughs]

Trog: It turns out that a reflective material is not suitable for chroma-keying. [Baaulp laughs] Because you will reflect the green off of the chroma- off o the greenscreen onto the suit. So this was about... twenty minutes before we were supposed to go live, and I'm sitting there like, fiddling with every knob that I have available, like, "I ca- he's a, he's a ghost! I cannot get him to chroma-key properly anymore, how did we not consider this a problem?" So, we- it ended up being pretty bad. It looked pretty shitty, but I think that the nice thing about the kind of productions that we put on is that if it looks shitty we can always just pretend like it adds to the comedy.

Scorpy: The best thing about that was that moment happened twenty minutes before it was supposed to go live. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah, so... [inaudible] the suit and pants...

Scorpy: [crosstalk] So, put on the suit get in front of the greenscreen. and all I hear is "you're a ghost!" [laughs] "You're a ghost!"

[Wayne, Trog, and Baaulp, maybe Gir, laugh]

Scorpy: And I couldn't see what was happening all like "what the fuck are they talking about?"

Wayne: We, we had two angles, we had the main one which was with my, my high-grade like, Sony camera. Uh, and then we had the other one which was just my old webcam. And on the old webcam it was even worse-

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: Originally that shot didn't have a background, it was just a black void and honestly i thought it looked amazing. Like it was like scary, me like just, like this phantom hovering in a void, but we ended up putting the, the uh big conference screen background behind me.

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: Which, maybe was not the right choice? But it was great either way.

Baaulp: Biggest lesson from the GameClam 2 show, uh, more than a week of prep!

Trog: See- 

Wayne: [crosstalk] Also-

Trog: And no reflective materials on the greenscreen. That's what we learned.

Gir: Before you input anything else Wayne, I do have to- I was not involved in this project at all. BUT I did realize something, uh, afterwards where Baaulp had his little monologue at the start. And he mentioned that there was one Tanner Ball. And I got to him after I was like, "did you talk about this kid that I knew when I was young on purpose?" And Baaulp goes, "no, I just also knew somebody named Tanner Ball."

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: Well there you go.

[Wayne laughing]

Baaulp: It's a common name.

Trog: Tanner Balls all over the world. East coast to west coast. It's universal.

Wayne: [crosstalk] So yeah. R-rule number one and two, no reflective surfaces you know, bla- yadda yadda yadda. 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] No reflective SUITS.

Wayne: Rule number three, do not hot glue a plastic gem to a rogue(?) bald cap.

[Baaulp laughs]

Trog: Oh yeah, there was a lot of costuming errors made mere minutes before we went live.

Wayne: Baaulp, Baaulp introduced the show with his, with Jeff Kealey's uh little, little, discussion about the pre-show, with the patent leaks and all that. And while that was happening, I was resting my legs and sitting down because I was gonna be standing for the next hour and a half.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: And we were sitting there watching you, and then all of a sudden I just feel like *suhsuhsh* like all of a sudden, I look down and the gem's on the floor.

[Scorpy laughs]

Wayne: And I'm , and I like... Trog doesn't notice it and just hears me go [Scorpy continues to laugh] "oh my god. The gem- we, we lost the gem. We lost the gem. And I- [laughs] This was like, Baaulp was literally wrapping up and I was like, "oh my god Baaulp if you can hear me please hold on for a minute!" And I run out of the room and I hear in my headphones Baaulp going "aaaalright, and we're gonna move on, the show's about to begin folks!" 

[Gir laughs]

Wayne: And I run into my kitchen, and I grab shipping tape, and I bundle it up in a ball and just stick it on my forehead, slap the gem on there, uh- it HELD, and no one noticed that there was just tape underneath it apparently. The, uh, and it didn't fall off through the entire show, however... the new adhesion method and the placement did kind of make it look like hair-

Trog: [crosstalk] Oh yeah!

Wayne: In the, in the, in the camera shot that we had, like, like, from far away it did look like I had a blue mohawk. It was really weird, but it didn't really matter. We got the effect.

Trog: I love that the inclusion of the gem on Mr. White's forehead was SO IMPORTANT we could not go on with the production without it there.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Absolutely NOT!

Trog: We HAD to get that gem on his forehead.

[Scorpy laughs]

Wayne: There would've been even more questions when we got to the celebrity slideshow. 

Baaulp: I mean, absolutely not because that is like, for, for, I mean for context even if you've, after you've seen it, for context like, the gag was that like, they're rich and in- they're not just like wearing jewelry, wearing fancy clothes like, like, I, I, at some point we had the idea like "what if all these celebrities started getting these dangerous, experimental body modifications and everyone's just embedding gems into their bodies?" [laughs]

Wayne: Into their EYES.

Trog: Exactly. So, that was great. All that stuff.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] It's, it's too funny to give up! But thank god, thank god I've worked enough jobs in corporate settings to be able to fill dead air. Like I've done enough presentations in college and work to be able to fill dead air with just GARBAGE. Caus like I- once I realized like, "oh. We're not cutting away from me. I better just keep talking." 

[Scorpy laughs]

Baaulp: So I kept talking, thankfully.

Scorpy: I remember that, I remember that moment so well because I was like, it was a weird situation where like, Trog and Wayne couldn't hear me if i spoke but I could hear them. And Baaulp couldn't hear anyone. So I was just stuck there listening and all I hear is- all I hear is, "oh my god. Lost the gem." And I was like "what does THAT mean??" Basically any time I was hearing something from their end I couldn't tell what was happening. 

Trog: We COULD hear you. We could hear you through the Discord.

Scorpy: [crosstalk, laughing] Okay.

Wayne: No TROG could hear you. I couldn't.

Trog: [crosstalk] Oh no yeah yeah. Only I could, as the producer. Wayne could not, could not hear you. We had kind of a complex setup going on as we always do.

Baaulp: I had the intuition that if they weren't cutting away from me then i need to kill time for one reason or another.

[Scorpy laughs]

Trog: I can always trust on Baaulp to fill time when I'm like, trying to get the next thing going. So, thank you very much Baaulp you did an excellent job filling time.

Scorpy: Yes.

Trog: And I wanna say, like, we... I mean this is pretty well known but like, we don't really script anything out. Like we had a rough, ROUGH outline of what we wanted to happen, but pretty much everything else is just completely improv. So it's always fun to like, you know, kind of like by the seat of our pants fly through that stuff.

Scorpy: [crosstalk] Yep.

Trog: Like, trying to look at the script and also trying to come up with jokes and being like, "okay, we have to hit these points but we don't- we didn't write down what they mean so we're like- 

[Scorpy laughs]

Trog: -trying to interpret our own jokes that we made like a week and a half ago." It's, it's very confusing. 

Baaulp: I mean it makes it really fun because like, for example, me having to look at Log's drawings and talk about them is great.

Scorpy: Yeah, and like the outline that was just one line. [laughs] Like-

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I feel like our group THRIVES on shit like that.

Wayne: The outline that will have single jokes written down that need to be said no matter what that completely contradict everything else that was said such as, "the very important note that I must say, the GameClam 2 Slim is NOT a console."

Trog: [crosstalk, laughing] It's NOT a console. And it's not an ATM.

[Baaulp laughs]

Wayne: Well I never said THAT.

Trog: Oh that's true you never did say it's not an ATM. You just said it's not a console.

Scorpy: That was in one of the videos, it just said at the bottom it's not an ATM.

Baaulp: That-

[Wayne laughs]

Baaulp: If you, wanna make me laugh, that is like, that is my favorite part of the whole presentation. Like, I love it when, I love, I love it when it veers into like bullshit slapstick, almost to the point where it almost is bullshit slapstick where it's like... it's SO clearly an ATM and for someone to just look at the camera and say it's NOT an ATM it's [breaks off laughing]

Trog: Yeah.

Scorpy: I mean that's fuckin', that's Will.i.am like saying that his watch is NOT A WATCH.

Wayne: -'S NOT A WATCH.

Trog: That joke was lifted from reality! That, that joke was not a joke originally.

Scorpy: [crosstalk] Yeah, that's-

[Baaulp laughs]

Scorpy: -something that actually happened.

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah. Look up Will.i.am Pulse Watch Interview. And just have some fun.

Baaulp: [laughs] It has a slot...

Scorpy: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] -it has a slot to put your credit card...

Wayne: [crosstalk] The Will.i.am Puse. 

Baaulp: It has a slot to put your credit card, but it's NOT your ATM, it's not. It's not, it's got a number pad but it's NOT an ATM-

Wayne: [crosstalk] Does an ATM have a "Jump" and "Swear" button? No.

Trog: [crosstalk] No. Exactly.

Scorpy: [crosstalk] They SHOULD.

Gir: An ATM GIVES you money.

[Trog laughs]

Wayne: Well, the GameClam Slim does give you money, it makes you RICH with money! If you WIN.

Trog: [crosstalk] Somehow. We didn't-

Scorpy: Actually the entire design of the controller is the opposite of that, so I- it was never thought about more than that. Y

[Wayne laughs]

Scorpy: You put money in but it doesn't come out! 

Wayne: We like forgot that feature, we never explained how you get your earnings from Grand Theft Auto VI.

Scorpy: Caus it's a scam! Caus it's a scam! 

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Scorpy: [crosstalk] You put in your money and you never get it back!

[MUSIC: "野風的家" (Wild Winds of Home) by Yin Xia]

Wayne: Where do we begin? I'm Wayne.

Trog: I'm Trog.

Log: See that? That's Log.

Gir: [laughing] I'm Gir.

Baaulp: And I'm Baaulp.

Wayne: That's Baaulp.

Gir: [crosstalk] He's Baaulp.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yep.

Log: [crosstalk] Uh-huh.

Wayne: [crosstalk] That's him!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I'm Baaulp.

Wayne: Hello, and welcome... to it. We're here. And we're—

Trog: Where do we begin?

Wayne: Our voices are ready and primed, we're about to speak—

Log: I already spoke.

Wayne: And, uh... We're about to speak some more, we're about to give you fresh word juice. Straight from the press.

Log: Straight from the mother's milk.

Wayne: Straight from the Wi-Fi connected press are these juiced and pureed baby's words.

Log: Yeah, you can squeeze 'em directly out of liquid.

Wayne: It's so edible. [crosstalk] And drinkable.

Log: It's an expensive process to squeeze liquid out of liquid but we take the time and the money to do it for you.

Trog: It's organic.

Log: Be grateful.

Baaulp: Uh, hey—I—

Wayne: [crosstalk] If you add a third squeezing on there, you just get sand.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I—I'm sorry—

Wayne: [crosstalk] So don't take the process any further.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I'm sorry, I'm sorry to interrupt—

Wayne: [crosstalk] You—apologize, now, Baaulp.

Baaulp: Saying my own name made me zone out, what the fuck is this segue? What are we squeezing?

Trog: Juices.

Log: We're squeezing word juice. This is our—

Wayne: [crosstalk] Our fresh word juice.

Log: We do this every day, Baaulp.

Wayne: Get a cup ready!

Baaulp: [laughing] What the fuck?

Gir: Slurp.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Get a cup ready and pull the lever.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] There has to be a better way.

Trog: Yeah, we do this every time, Baaulp. We talk about word juice every episode.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] We do?

Wayne: [crosstalk] Get your cups ready! And pull the lever. Fill 'er up!

Baaulp: How about instead of this segue that's going nowhere, how about we talk about our interesting lives?

Wayne: This isn't a segue!

Trog: This is the content!

Log: Hey, how about—yeah, fuck you, you little bitch!

Gir: [crosstalk] I hope you die!

Log: [crosstalk] I hope you die!

Gir and Log: [laughter]

Baaulp: What?

Log: Anyways—

Baaulp: You hope I die?

Log: Anyways—

Wayne: I veto Baaulp off the podcast.

Log: Speaking of word juice, come suckle on this teat as I tell you my brand new story.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] No.

Trog: [crosstalk] Nope, hate that one! Can we take it—can we do another one?

Gir: [crosstalk] Nope, that's gettin' cut.

Trog: [laughing] Do we have to do that one?

Log: [laughing] You have a better idea?

Trog: No, just go.

Gir: Speaking of word juice, here's something for you to suck.

Log: Here's—here's the new—

Wayne: [crosstalk] Alright, fresh—no, do this—

Log: [crosstalk] Here's the new juice—

Wayne: Say this way.

Gir: [laughing] Say this way!

Baaulp: [laughing] Say this way! Yeah!

Wayne: [laughing] No, that's—that's a reference.

Log: Alright, first glass of word juice comin' right at 'cha. So about a week and a half ago, I moved into my very first apartment.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Woo!

Log: For the first time in this Log life, I'm— 

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Hooray! 

Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah!

Log: I'm livin' on my own!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Woohoo!

Trog: [crosstalk] You did it!

Log: I'm livin' the—the—

Wayne: [crosstalk] You did it.

Log: —bachelor's life.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] You did it.

Trog: [crosstalk] Wow. I can't believe it.

Baaulp: [fucking guitar noises with his mouth?? idk how to transcribe this]

Log: I'm livin' the tyrant's life, in my second floor throne.

Wayne: [also starts making guitar noises]

Wayne and Trog: [laughter]

Log: ...I don't think that's gonna work out.

Trog: [crosstalk] I think it's gonna work great.

Log: But, anyways—Um, yeah. I'm recording this from my brand new room in this brand new abode.

Wayne: The fan—

Baaulp: The fan went with him.

Wayne: The fan is gone. No more tick, tick, tick. None of that.

Log: [crosstalk] Yeah, this one's a lot nicer.

Wayne: [crosstalk] It's all clean. The audio slurp, smooth. Drink it.

Baaulp: I—I messed up the audio with that one. That's part of why it was there. I did noise gate it, and then I just used that wrong file when I edited. Oops!

Log: Yeah, so, it wasn't even my fault, so don't talk to me, ok? Ok. Um, yeah, I'm living here now, and it's really cool—

Baaulp: [crosstalk] What is, uh—

Log: What?

Baaulp: I was gonna say, what are the perks of living there?

Log: Well, one really cool thing is that this apartment complex works closely with this moving company, so—

Baaulp: They just moved your shit in for free?

Log: Pretty much.

Baaulp: Woah! What?

Log: The first two and a half hours of moving were free, for moving into this apartment—

Baaulp: [crosstalk] That's sick.

Log: —but, I had only a room's worth of stuff, so they got it done in like an hour and a half.

Baaulp: Well you gotta fill it with crap now like everyone here does in Boston, and then they all throw their shit away in September, and there's literally free chairs and tables down the street.

Gir: I love that.

Log: Well, I have lots of cool box furniture now. Um, I pretty much only use the bedroom and the kitchen. There's, like, a big living room space that just has, like, three bar stools, two tables, and six boxes.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: For a long time, the centerpiece of that room was a single bar stool with a dress shirt on top of it because I put it there after drying it and I never put it in the closet.

Trog: Because the stool had to dress up for his interview.

Log: Yeah, he had to look cool, and he had to look good for me.

Gir: Log, you reminded me, by saying that you had movers, like most people who move—But you reminded me, when I was younger I had moved to Germany. 

Gir: And we had some German movers, you know, as would make sense, and they were moving our shit upstairs and stuff, and I went upstairs to look at what they were doing 'cause I'm a kid, I'm bored, my computer is still locked away in its box prison, and I'm looking at what they're doing, and there's just these two men pulling a dresser back and forth between each other, shouting "Boy's room!" "Girl's room!" "Boy's room!" "Girl's room!"

Baaulp and Trog: [laughter]

Gir: [crosstalk] And they didn't know where the fuck the dresser went.

Trog: [crosstalk] What, like a cartoon?

Baaulp: Wait, were they saying this in English? Or in German?

Gir: Yes! English.

Wayne: [laughing] They just—they weren't confused, they were just having fun.

Gir: [laughter]

Baaulp: What is boy and girl in German? Girl is like 'frau', but boy is like, what? I don't remember.

Wayne: Boy-len.

Baaulp: [laughter]

Trog: Was it possible that they were rehearsing for a one-act play?

Wayne: [laughing] Called "Boy's Room, Girl's Room?"

Trog: Yeah, "Boy's Room, Girl's Room." It's a famous German play, you've never heard about it?

Wayne: Boy's room, girl's room, whatcha gonna do?

Log: I think they were training to get their arms stronger for the next set of families that they had to move because their families were stronger than yours and had much bigger rocks to lift.

Wayne: They were trying to clip the dresser through the floor.

Gir: But I—I interjected and I was like, "Uh, yeah that goes in the girl's room." And the guy who was trying to say it went in the boy's room—

Wayne: And he said "Boy's room!" 

Gir: He just dropped it, and like, was pissed off, and the girl's room guy was like, smug and laughing at him.

Trog: Wow. You just ruined that man's day.

Gir: Yeah, and then I made the other guy's day fuckin' fantastic. It was great.

Wayne: Better end to the story: You told him girl's room and he said "Boy's room!" and brought it to the boys room all by himself.

Gir: He said "Boy's room!" and threw it at me.

Trog: And now Gir is a ghost.

Wayne: "There's the boy! Get him!" and he chucks the dresser at you, overhead slams it into your chest, killing MasterGir.

Gir: Tom and Jerry style.

Trog: If you die via, like, getting a dresser dropped on you, is your ghost, like, trapped inside of that dresser now? Like, you haunt that dresser forever? And whenever people open up the drawers you, like, fly out and give 'em a scare?

Wayne: Cool idea for a story: That exact situation, someone Tom and Jerry throws a dresser at you and you die, and you haunt the dresser and the clothes within it, and someone puts on the clothes, and then, like, the person is wearing you, as clothes, as a ghost.

Trog: Can you control them?

Log: You know, there's already a book on that, you know.

Wayne: What's it called?

Log: Uh, Flat Stanley's Final Sacrifice.

Baaulp: [laughter]

Wayne: Of course.

Baaulp: That's the—that's the sequel to Flatland. It's intense.

Log: No, it's the sequel to Flat Stanley, you fucker.

Trog: [laughter]

Baaulp: What?

Wayne: [laughter]

Gir: Flat Stanley's from Flatland, right?

Trog: Oh...

Wayne: Yeah, Flat Stanley's from Flatland, in the world where he's the only flat person ever.

Trog: In the world where—wait, no, he comes from Flatland, where everyone is flat, he's brought through a wormhole at the beginning of the book.

Wayne: [crosstalk] No, he's a child and he's squished!

Trog: No, no.

Wayne: He's squished by a board!

Trog: They retcon that. They retcon that in the third book.

Gir: [laughter]

Wayne: Oh.

Log: What's that one called?

Wayne: Flat Stanley's Oral Sacrifice.

Trog and Log: [laughter]

Baaulp: [laughing] Oh, no!

Trog: That one's, ah, not for kids.

Wayne: No, it's not—it's a—what!? You pervert. It's not for sexual. It's fuckin' or—like he eats bad food.

Trog: Well, it's a good thing that it's not for sexual, 'cause you get paper cuts. 

Baaulp: Oh, jeez.

Wayne: Ok. But for real, but for real. [crosstalk] Flat Stanley should've—

Trog: [crosstalk] I love Flat Stanley.

Wayne: Flat Stanley should've died.

Gir: Like, you wanted him to? Or it was circumstantial?

Trog: Uh, I don't think you're gonna find any debate for this topic here.

Wayne: [laughing] Yeah, because you all agree. Everyone agrees, Flat Stanley should be dead.

Trog: [crosstalk] Everyone agrees, Flat Stanley should've died! That's a one hu—like, they throw out—they put that question on the fuckin' survey whenever you have to say, like, your age and your gender and stuff. Should Flat Stanley have died? And one hundred percent, people say yes. You'd get a hundred points on Family Feud for that question.

Gir: [crosstalk] What if you say no?

Wayne: Alright, alright. I'm gonna make a YouTube channel called Book Fails, and my first video's gonna be testing "could Flat Stanley be real?" And I drop a poster board on my son, and he does not become flat, and immediately I've debunked this awful, awful series.

Gir: We need to stop feeding our children lies!

Baaulp: Is that the only thing you're gonna test?

Wayne: Alright. Who wants to drop the next Flat Stanley burn? Who wants to fucking rip this book open?

Trog: [crosstalk] Fucking flat bitch!

Wayne: Yeah! Yeah! Don't even, like, insult a particular aspect of him, let's just call him a bitch!

Trog: He's a flat asshole.

Wayne: Fuck you, Flat Stanley! You flat motherfucker.

Gir: Flat Stanley, you dumbass!

Log: He doesn't have—

Gir: Don't even have three dimensions.

Log: He doesn't have any real paper powers, right? You can't, like, hole punch him and put him in a binder or anything, he'll just die.

Trog: [crosstalk] He can like, fit through—he can fit through small places, you can fold him. Probably.

Wayne: You flat sucker! Why not get 3D? Dumbass.

Gir: I got sent a picture, because my family was military, I got sent a picture of somebody strapping Flat Stanley to a bomb. I'm not kidding.

Trog: Sick. I hope—I'm glad he's dead.

Log: [laughter]

Wayne: Good!

Gir: So Flat Stanley is canonically dead. He died in the Afghan war.

Wayne: When I was a kid I really liked Flat Stanley, and, they—each Flat Stanley book, the last page was just like a picture of Stanley that you could cut out and play with, and I did that, and, you know, thinking back about that, I also did that with the—there was a Paper Mario ad that was like, "cut him out, and you get a free demo," and I, like—

{0:10:00}

Gir: [crosstalk] It was a free demo, yeah.

Wayne: —and, like, I did cut him out, and I played with him. And I realized that I miss being able to be so easily entertained that I could play with a piece of paper with a picture of a person on it.

Gir: Yeah, and now you just sit around making silly sounds to entertain yourself. How complex.

Wayne: Actually, I'm gonna go print out a picture—I'm gonna go print out a picture of Mario and cut it out right now.

Trog: I think, uh—

Log: I wish I had a printer.

Trog: I have a question about Flat Stanley. This is the Flat Stanley podcast now. I have a question about Flat Stanley, uh, it's been a long time since I read that book, does he not return to his normal proportions at the end of the book?

Wayne: I can't remember.

Gir: [crosstalk] I never read the book.

Trog: Is he flat forever? Is that his fate? Is the final book Flat Stanley's Final Fate?

Wayne: I think this is like a Men in Black-type situation.

Baaulp: This is some, like, "I'm an immigrant" shit happening. I thought Flat Stanley's Final Sacrifice was just a joke that we came up with. Is this an actual line of books?

Wayne: No, it's not called "Flat Stanley's Final Sacrifice!" 

Gir and Trog: [laughter]

Log: Flat Stanley is like a book that every six year old child reads in the United States.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] I didn't read 'em.

Gir: I didn't read 'em either.

Wayne: It is a book—ok, Baaulp, Baaulp, because you probably have not been getting our jokes, Flat Stanley is a book about a child who puts up a new poster board, and then it falls on him, and instead of killing him he becomes flat and can get through doors, and, I—what the fuck was that book about? 

Trog: Yeah, I don't know.

Wayne: Like—

Log: Um, if I recall correctly, he becomes a kite—

Wayne: Doesn't he, like, put himself in a letter?

Log: He falls through a sewer grate—

Trog: [laughing] Does he fall through a sewer grate?

Log: [crosstalk] He falls through a sewer grate.

Trog: I don't remember that.

Log: Um, he falls through a sewer grate, and then he hides inside the frame of a painting at an art museum and catches art thieves.

Gir: Oh, I know how—ok, it ends where he gets a bike pump stuck in him and he gets inflated.

Trog: Ok—

Wayne: How did that happen!?

Trog: Talking about Flat Stanley again, if Flat Stanley was not a picture book, you could've told me that it was written by, like, fucking Kafka or something and I would believe you. It sounds horrific.

Baaulp: Kafka wrote, like, action-adventure serials of a flat man who hides in museums and catches thieves.

Trog: [laughter]

Baaulp: If a two-dimensional man was like, "Hey, stop right there, you art thief," like, what would he do to me? I have a whole dimension over him.

Trog: [crosstalk] He'd give you paper cuts.

Baaulp: Like, forget being stronger, like, if you're stronger than someone, it's like, "oh, shit." It's like, I have a full dimension over you. I could walk through you probably.

Wayne: He—he would just—he would just turn sideways and pull out a gun so that you couldn't see him anymore and then he'd shoot you.

Baaulp: But it'd be a two-dimensional gun that shoots two-dimensional bullets. 

Trog: He would also flatten a gun.

Wayne: No, he can still grab things! 

Trog: No, but he would flatten the gun, and flatten the bullets, so that you can't see 'em.

Wayne: The flat bullet—oh, god.

Log: If Flat Stanley spots you he throws a dresser at you full-force and then you turn into Flat Stanley.

Wayne, Trog, Baaulp, and Gir: [laughter]

Trog: It's like a—it's the Flat Stanley curse.

Wayne: Flat Stanley's weapon of choice would only be flat weapons. So shurikens—

Gir: Swords.

Wayne: Knives, swords. No, swords are not flat, 'cause they got, uh, the handle.

Gir: Katanas.

Log: Yo, I bought—I bought, like, the strongest knife ever to cook my meals.

Baaulp: That's a very—this is a very good question. This is like something out of, like, a comic book, or, like, JoJo's Bizarre Adventure or something, like—What would it feel like to be hurt in two dimensions but not the third?

Wayne: What?

Gir: Like getting a paper cut.

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: No, that's a 3D injury! What is a two-dimensional injury like?

Wayne: I'm not even—

Trog: Baaulp, ok, what's a 2D injury, Baaulp!?

Wayne: I'm not—Baaulp, I'm not understanding your question. I don't know what you're asking.

Trog: Why don't you explain?

Baaulp: Imagine someone had—like a bad guy, whose superpower is he can only hurt—he can injure you in the first and second dimensions, but not the third. 

Wayne: [crosstalk] That doesn't mean anything!

Trog: [crosstalk] That doesn't mean anything, Baaulp!

Wayne: Baaulp, you have to tell us what that means so we can answer your question.

Baaulp, So—so they can harm you, but only when it comes to length and width, but not height.

Wayne: [laughing] That could mean anything!

Trog: So he just takes chunks out of you like you're a fucking cross-section? Like—

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: I don't know, man.

Baaulp: But no, but like—but like, it'd be a perfect—

Gir: Isn't that a scene in Cabin in the Woods?

Log: He just extends a pole at you? He has a Sun Wukong pole that he extends at you in a straight line?

Baaulp: No, that's still a three-dimensional object.

Wayne: So far, we have—we have, uh, multiple powers for our perfect supervillain. He can damage you on the X and Y plane, but not the Z plane—

Trog: Right.

Wayne: And he can then rapture you.

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: [laughter]

Wayne: Alright. What other powers does the ultimate villain have?

Log: He has the strongest kitchen knife.

Wayne: That's not a power, that's a possession. I could have that.

Baaulp: Why do you need that if you could rapture people?

Log: It's enough for a superhero. Or a supervillain.

Wayne: Does—what does he do with it?

Gir: Joker has no powers, and he's like—

Wayne: Does he have the intellect to have that, to use that knife?

Gir: [laughter]

Log: He can puncture any unopenable packet of sauce like it's nothing.

Wayne: Then I shoot him and he's dead. 

Trog: Uh—

Wayne: And then I'm the hero. What's up, Trog?

Log: You think he's dead, but in fact he just silently broke open a packet of ketchup and squirted it at you.

Wayne: Oh my—wh—the dastardly villain!

Baaulp: Hey, talking about, uh, talking about, like, superheroes and stuff—

Wayne: Trog was going to talk, but ok.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Oh, too late for that.

Trog: [crosstalk] Well it's too late now.

Baaulp: I butt in.

Wayne: It's too late!

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Uh, I was on the train with my—

Trog: [crosstalk] I was just gonna say poop jump.

Baaulp: I was on the train with my f—I was on the train with my friend Mike, and we were talking about X-Men 'cause he knew more about X-Men than me. And I thought about it, like, isn't Nightcrawler the strongest X-Men with the ability to teleport? And he's like, yeah he's one of the strongest. I was like, no, he should be the strongest because he could literally just teleport somewhere, shoot you, and then teleport away, and then you wouldn't be able to do anything about it. And Mike said—

Wayne: And then you're Wolverine, and you poop the bullet out of your skin with your fucking adamantium powers.

Baaulp: But like, but then Wolverine wouldn't be able to catch him. Point is—

Wayne, Gir, and Trog: [laughter]

Trog: That sounds more like a stalemate!

Wayne: Nightcrawler just bullies Wolverine by teleporting up to him, shooting him, teleporting away, and then doing it again five minutes later.

Trog: Over and over.

Baaulp: That should canonically make him, like, one of the strongest X-Men. Like, if he was fast enough, he could even catch, like, Magneto off guard and just, like, kill him before he could even react.

Wayne: Can he teleport weapons, though? I don't think he can. I'm pretty sure if he was holding something and he teleported, he would drop it.

Baaulp: He can bring his clothes with him.

Wayne: Yeah, but that's, like, special X-Men clothes.

Baaulp: No!

Trog: So he makes a special X-Men gun.

Baaulp: Dude, in the X-Men movies he's just wearing—he wears, like, jeans and cargo pants and shit like that.

Gir: They're special X-Men jeans!

Baaulp: [laughing] Special X-Men cargo pants. No, no, I—no, I need to get to the point.

Wayne: This is a dumb story because the strongest X-Man is the Flash.

Baaulp: You didn't let me get to the point! Mike was like, oh, he doesn't do that because he's religious.

Trog: What?

Gir: Uh, what?

Baaulp: That's the canon reason why.

Wayne: Oh, he doesn't wanna kill people?

Baaulp: Yeah!

Trog: Alright.

Baaulp So then I said, alright, we'll tone it down. What if he just had a taser?

Baaulp, Gir, and Trog: [laughter]

Gir: You just pop in in front of somebody and tase them.

Baaulp: [laughing] Yeah!

Wayne: Well, that wouldn't work on Magneto.

Baaulp: That's true, but, hey, if you're not willing to bring a gun or like a sword or anything, like, beggars can't be choosers!

Trog: Well, a gun wouldn't work on Magneto either.

Wayne: It also wouldn't work on Static Shock.

Trog: Static Shock was not an X-Men.

Gir: What if you give him a syringe filled with, like, sedative?

Baaulp: [laughing] That's so obtuse! That's—

Trog: Just bring a wooden gun. Fuck it.

Gir: He would just quietly pop in behi—[laughter]

Baaulp: [laughter]

Gir: What?

Wayne: [in an old man voice] A wooden gun!

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: [in an old man voice] No! You tricked me!

Gir: [in an old man voice] My only weakness! Wood.

Log: Man, they had no ideas back in the sixties when it came to superheroes.

Trog: [crosstalk] I think they had lots of ideas.

Wayne: [crosstalk] No, they did, because that was the first idea.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Like, they weren't having ideas prior to that, so they could just get away with, like, "Oh my god, there's a gorilla! Ohh!"

Gir: Ideas didn't exist before the 1960s. 

Log: There was, like, no concept of, like, forethought back then, I guess.

Trog: No, it was fucking rags made to sell to children.

Log: [in a nasally voice] Hey—hey boss! Hey boss! Hey Mister—Mister Jeremy! The boss of Marvel cartoons in the sixties!

Baaulp: [laughing] Yeah, Jeremy! The boss of Marvel!

Log: [in a nasally voice] Hey, we just—we got halfway through this episode about Magneto versus the Fantastic Four, once he figures out the gun is wooden, what stops him from throwing all the cars at everybody and winning?

Gir: [in a deep voice] He's religious!

Wayne: That is—that is truly—I think about that all the time, because that is truly just, like, the stupidest thing. He's literally like, he's just like, I... have been bested. I will no longer attempt to fight, for I have been tricked.

Trog: He lost.

Wayne: And I am Magneto, a fool.

Baaulp: Yeah, if it was like, Magneto from the movies, he'd, like, immediately flip out and just start, like, ripping cars in half.

Wayne: He would get in the car with the cops, and then crush everyone in the car except him from the fuckin' inside.

Gir: And then blow it up.

Wayne: Magneto's cool. I don't like, like, comics, but I think Magneto's cool.

Baaulp: Magneto is cool.

Log: [unintelligible]

Baaulp: He has a cool superpower.

Wayne: Yeah, that's why I like him. Marvel.

Baaulp: I watched, like, one of those generic, like, nerdy, science-y videos on YouTube, it was so—the, like, channel—

Wayne: Is Magneto real?

Baaulp: No, no, it wasn't like one of those, it was a little more, like, actually educational. It was like, if Magneto actually had—

Wayne: I put a magnet on my fridge, and it stuck!

Baaulp: [laughter] No, it was like, if you had actual powers like Magneto, what would be, like, some of the shit you could pull? And, like, uh, one of the things they said is Magneto could, if he just had, like, train tracks with, like, nothing in his way, he could start running on the train tracks and travel near the speed of light.

Wayne: They should do that.

Gir: That's actually fucking cool.

Wayne: I would love to see that in a Marvel movie. Old ass man—

Baaulp: Yeah, that's why Magneto's so cool! Like, magnetism's a cool power. Like, its only limiter is how, like, smart you are, really.

Log: Hey, how come Magneto in the movies never does a gravity squeeze?

Wayne: [in a deep voice] Gravity squeeze!

Wayne: Uh, it'd be too good.

Log: And that was enough—

Wayne: No, I bet he does!

Log: That was enough of a video game reference to start talking about video games. So let's—

Wayne: I—I bet he does a gravity squeeze. There's no way he doesn't do a gravity squeeze.

Log: There's—he doesn't do a gravity squeeze because—

Baaulp: [crosstalk] He rips the iron out of someone's butt.

Log: —because he doesn't say "you are defeated!" at any point during the movies.

Wayne: I mean, he doesn't say the lines because the world is not as good as we would like it to be, and movie characters do not say their moves like video game characters.

Trog: If only.

Wayne: I want that to be a real life construct. Special moves need to be real.

Gir: Gun!

Log: Yeah. But, anyways, we talked about a video game just now.

Gir: We did?

Log: Marvel VS Capcom for—

Trog: Sure did.

Gir: Oh.

Log: And now we're gonna talk about more video games. First one I wanna talk about is Soulcalibur VI. Did you guys see the videos?

Wayne: I just saw a GIF Mira posted of a wizard.

Trog: Yeah. There was a wizard.

Log: Yeah, so they—they announced, uh—they, like, showed a story mode trailer for the first time. And, like, the big bad guy is just this wizard looking dude that shoots swords.

Trog: Yeah. You know, I'm gonna say, doesn't look like a wizard, does look like a warlock. Or maybe a sorcerer.

Log: Yeah, I think—I think a mystic of some kind. Yeah.

Trog: He has, like, he—he doesn't have a discernible weapon, which I think is cool in a game like Soulcalibur. 'Cause it probably means he's gonna have some crazy shit.

Wayne: Does he do some Noctis shit? Like he spawns weapons?

Trog: No.

Wayne: You said he shoots swords.

Log: Yeah, he—he, like, creates a bunch of laser swords.

Trog: The only thing in the trailer is like, he, like, spawns a bunch of knives that start shooting at a character in a cutscene, so who knows how that'll translate into gameplay. But seems cool!

Gir: I did notice something about Street Fighter, like, they're getting the President of Earth or something?

Trog: [crosstalk] They have the President of Earth!

Log I don't give a shit about Street Fighter V, lets talk about Soulcalibur VI still.

Trog, Baaulp: [laughter]

Gir: Let's move on!

Baaulp: You can see where the biases lie in the people who play fighting games in this podcast.

Gir: I passed on all of it. I'm not a fighting game man.

Log: You know how it is. Me, Wayne, and Trog, we all played a bunch of Street Fighter IV. We had 6 player lobbies runnin' every night, practically. Just havin' a fun old time. Street Fighter V came out, [crosstalk] and it just killed everything for us.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: So, y'know, that sucks. Movin' on, we got better games now. Or maybe worse games! Because, also Soulcalibur VI, they came out with a trailer for Tira. Y'know, the character with like, [crosstalk] the circle—

Trog: The hula hoop! Yeah!

Baaulp: Uh huh.

Log: That attacks you with the circle? Yeah, the bladed hula hoop? The very first thing, it goes— you know how they do the intros for all trailers, where it just like, [crosstalk] shows the picture of the two swords?

Trog: Yeah.

Log: It goes like, [explosion noises, triumphant music]

Trog: Yeah.

Log: It does that, except it also says, "DLC CHARACTER!"

Trog: Yeah, that I was really bummed about. [crosstalk] I'm like, really?

Wayne: [laughter]

Baaulp: Wow!

Gir: Wait, they announced—

Baaulp: They—

Wayne: Fuckin', like, they— It's nothing to be surprised about, [crosstalk] because they did it with Tekken.

Trog: It's not surprising, it's just upsetting, like...

Gir: [crosstalk] Disappointing.

Baaulp: Well, I mean, okay—

Wayne: I don't give a shit, I'm gonna buy the season pass anyways.

Trog: Day 1 DLC is bullshit, I'm not gonna—

Log: Here's the— here's the bitch move, I'm gonna say. Tira is a preorder bonus.

Trog: Oh...

Log: But not for the game.

Trog: Wait, what?

Log: Tira is a preorder bonus for the season pass.

Wayne: [crosstalk] What?

Trog: Why can you preorder a season pass? [crosstalk] Would a season pass not just be immediately available?

Baaulp: Woah!

Wayne: Wait, wait, wait, you don't get her— you don't get her if you buy the season pass?

Log: So, Tekken 7, Eliza was a preorder bonus that wasn't included in the season pass, so maybe Tira is the same thing?

Wayne: No, I could've sworn she was! [crosstalk] I have Eliza.

Log: Um...

Trog: That's bizarre.

Log: No, it was like a preorder thing— it was preorder shit. She's not included in the season pass.

Wayne: Um...

Trog: What?

Log: Yeah, it's really confusing, they got, like, Japanese PR on deck making it extremely vague. They refer to Tira as a "bonus character" rather than a "DLC character".

Trog: [laughter] Here's a bonus that you can pay for!

Log: I'm not sure if that means she's not part of the season pass by default, or what. All I know is, [crosstalk] I'm not buying a season pass before I know what's in it.

Trog: Yeah, exactly.

Log: I'll buy— I'll buy the Tekken 7 season pass, because the 3 characters that they've already announced are characters that I wanna try, and 3 characters together costs the same as the season pass anyway.

Baaulp: So, hold up. Hold up—

Log: But Soulcalibur VI's season pass is going to have 3 characters that we don't know, and MAYBE Tira? Or maybe Tira's a bonus character! Who knows? I'm not fuckin' buyin' it.

Baaulp: For preordering the season pass, but if I buy the season pass, without preordering it, I won't get her. [crosstalk] Nice. Cool.

Trog: You MAY not get her. [crosstalk] It's not clear.

Baaulp: That's— that's smart.

Wayne: She's gonna be— it's gonna be rare DLC, not everyone can buy it.

Baaulp: [laughter]

Trog: Yeah fuck it, at this point, just make it a loot box.

Log: Exclusive!

Wayne: It's a loot box, and if you get the roll that gets you Tira, you have to buy it. It's like, okay, here's the button to buy Tira in the loot box. Hey! Let's talk about Negan.

Trog: I don't want to talk about Negan.

Wayne: Okay!

Trog: I actually don't have anything to say about Negan, because I've never seen that show.

Wayne: No more context for Negan! If you don't know what that is, too late!

Baaulp: Quick question, I'm a little confused. I have Tekken 7. I don't have any of the DLC, I just have the base game. How do I get Eliza?

Trog: You buy her.

Log: Buy her.

Baaulp: Okay, so she's not like, [crosstalk] locked away as a preorder thing.

Trog: No.

Baaulp: Okay.

Trog: [crosstalk] No, you can still get her.

Wayne: No, they would never do that. That would be bullshit. [crosstalk] A preorder character that you could only get as preorder and not buy later?

Trog: There's no way. Nobody would do that. Nobody would do that.

Wayne: No, no, no, Capcom would do that. I bet Capcom would do that with Marvel Infinite 2, [crosstalk] if that would ever be a thing.

Baaulp: Yeah, it's a— the thing I want to point— the thing that I'm like, super worried about with these fighting game companies is like, Capcom especially— it's like a slippery slope for the shit they're willing to pull.

Gir: Oh, Bamco actually did that. Bamco did that.

Trog: With what?

Baaulp: For what game?

Gir: The first Xenoverse.

Trog: Really? [crosstalk] Well, that's not a fighting game.

Wayne: Well, that doesn't matter!

Gir: No, I'm just saying, you said "nobody", but that's somebody.

Baaulp: No, it matters! Shit like this sets a precedent.

Gir: Yeah, and they didn't do it ever again.

Wayne: It's bad for the kind of games— like, the thing with Xenoverse is like, okay yeah, you don't get that character, but you don't have to practice against specific Xenoverse characters.

Gir: [crosstalk] I know.

Baaulp: That is true, but like... I dunno. I feel like companies love to test the waters with this shit. 'Cause you know some persons gonna be like, "Well, they didn't care with Xenoverse, so let's try with our next game!"

Gir: God forbid they do it, and it's like, "Oh, well let's try— we'll put in a preorder only boss for the new Dark Souls game!", or some shit like that.

Trog: [laughter] That would be weird. That would be really bizarre.

Baaulp: That would suck!

Wayne: It's just like, you preorder the game and you walk into a certain area, [crosstalk] and there's a boss, and if you don't, that areas still THERE, but its empty.

Baaulp: [laughter] It's right at the beginning!

Wayne: They just didn't put it there!

Gir: There's nothing at all!

Trog: Yeah, there's just nothing there. There's a sign that says, "Shoulda bought it!"

Gir, Log: [laughter]

Wayne: No, there's a sign that says "Preorder now!"

Trog: "Preorder now, even though it's too late to preorder, because you're playing the game!"

Wayne: [laughter]

Gir: You click the sign and it plays, like, a trailer for the DLC.

Trog: Oh God.

Baaulp: That reminds me of Nier Automata, where like, at certain parts of the map— I thought it was something I had to unlock— but there would be robots that'd be like "Sorry, there's nothing here! Go away!", and those were the DLC areas that were like, added to the game later.

Trog: Yeah, yeah. Let's talk about Monster Hunter for the next two hours.

Trog: Does anybody— does everybody wanna do that?

Baaulp: We’ve all been playing Monster Hunter.

Gir: Where do we begin?

Baaulp: Yeah where do we begin?

Trog: We- We have all been playing Monster Hunter World, some of us have already played it on the PS4 but Gir and Baaulp are both playing it for the first time on PC and I think— Well here’s the thing, so Monster Hunter World is out now, it’s been out for like—

Gir: Yeah.

Trog: —what a week and a half? 

Gir: Yeah.

Trog: In one week from when we’re recording this, Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate will come out and I think I’ve decided that I need to spend however… what, it’s like 300 dollars for a Switch or something? 

Wayne: [crosstalk] Three- [laughter] three hundred sixty dollars.

Trog: I think I’m gonna end up just s— I think I just am gonna end up dropping three hundred dollars just to play Monster Hunter on the Switch just like how on the WiiU I dropped however much money that was just to play 3U.

Wayne: Did you—

Log: Yeah.

Wayne: Yeah, you got other games out of the WiiU though.

Baaulp: Well, the good thing about the Switch is that there are gonna be a lot more Switch games.

Trog: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: Yeah, That’s true. 

Gir: Yeah. At least that’s a good purchase.

Wayne: It’s gonna give me a reason to touch my Switch. 

Gir: [laughter]

Wayne: [crosstalk] I literally—

Trog: There really hasn’t been a lot for that console in a while, yeah.

Wayne: I have not touched my Switch since PAX East. I played it in the hotel room and I haven’t used it then it’s been sitting in the exact same spot—

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: —up on my shelf on the right since PAX. And I don’t know why, [crosstalk] I have games. 

Trog: They haven’t released anything that’s why. [crosstalk] There was Mario, there was Zelda.

Wayne: No, but the thing is— the thing is—is I didn’t, I didn’t finish Mario or Zelda. 

Trog: Well.

Wayne: [crosstalk] And I just haven’t touched it.

Baaulp: Yeah I— Same thing with me. I never beat Bayonetta 2.

Gir: Here’s the reason why, is you’re so used to using a computer for your games.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Gir: It’s like, why would I get up and grab something else to play a video game when I can just stay right here.

Wayne: I don’t have to get up! I just have to reach my right arm [laughing] up a little bit.

Gir: That’s still too much effort for you ‘cause you’re used to a computer! I’ve got a— I literally could reach my arm over and grab my fuckin’ [crosstalk] Xbox controller.

Wayne: But I have to navigate the menus…

Trog: I don’t, I don’t have a Switch right now but the thing that I like about the Switch is that it is like, it— I think bar none it’s the best portable console that’s— or y’know, portable handheld whatever you wanna call it, that’s ever been released right, like? 

Wayne: Yeah.

Baaulp[?]: Yeah.

Trog: There’s no doubt about that, like there’s nothing that comes even close to it.

Wayne: I, Yeah like, I— So. Monster Hunter 3U was my first Monster Hunter game, a game I played the shit out of. Uh.. and, my favorite part about that game was being able to play it entirely on the WiiU pad—

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: —and this is just the same thing.

Trog: But better.

Gir: But better. Yeah. [laughter]

Wayne: Monster Hunter 3U was like, it was a 3DS game ported to a WiiU, looked like shit, it uh… it was just like, it was not really— they didn’t do much to it to make it work for the WiiU, but this is… I— I can’t wait, I thought I didn’t but I think I’m gonna get it.

Trog: See, here’s what I did.

Wayne: I’m gonna have a hard time balancing this shit because I— I wanna keep playing world. [crosstalk] I don’t know

Trog: Well you’re almost— I’ll be honest, here’s… and— and here’s what I kind of wanted to talk about involving World is that, here’s the problem with Monster Hunter World, as somebody who’s played it before a lot. They released the PC version without any of the extra content that the PS4 version has. And at first I was like, okay y’know I can deal with that, that like, that sucks obviously I would rather it launch with more content but it’s okay. But now that I’ve played through basically the entire game and like, I’m at the point now where I’ve unlocked all the content and I’m like, well, there’s nothing left for me to do now until they actually release more monsters for the PC version. So I don’t know, I— I just think it’s a really weird decision for them to make where it’s like, alright we’re gonna sell you Monster Hunter on PC finally but it’s not gonna come with anything, [laughing] like…

Baaulp: What is, what is Capcom’s rationale for that? Like, as far as multiplayer games goes like, the more content you have the better ‘cause you’re trying to get people to stay [crosstalk] playing the game.

Gir: I doubt that was Capcom’s decision, honestly.

Trog: I— I, well I think it was—

Wayne: Who’s decision was it?

Trog: Yeah who else— Who’s else’s decision would it be?

Gir: The, the actual developers.

Wayne: The monsters.

Baaulp: [laughing] The monsters, [crosstalk] they’re not ready!

Log: [laughing]

Trog: I mean it’s true, that’s another thing to point out with the pc release is that it is… and don’t get me wrong, I fucking love Monster Hunter World, I’ve played it for, I think 90 hours now so like, I’m allowed to talk shit on it but, the PC port has been plagued with technical issues, and—

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: —its been out for like what, I wanna say almost two weeks now? Almost three? I don’t even remember, and it’s still… It’s still broken in a lot of ways that they have yet to address.

Log: Yeah they’ve spent s— they’ve spent half a year on this PC port that, like, fuckin’ pile bunkers [crosstalk] your CPU into the dirt.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: It’s, it’s true it has problems but let’s play a game. Everyone open up your steam library and read how many hours you [crosstalk] have on like—

Trog: Yeah no that, thats what I was saying, that’s what I was saying like, don’t get me wrong I absolutely love Monster Hunter World, I think if you are in— I, I think this is the perfect game to get into Monster Hunter, I think if you’ve never tried the series before but you’re into third person action games that have like, a good grinding to them, like not a, not a monotonous grind but like an actual fun grind, I think if you’re into like resource gathering and stuff like that and minmaxing builds, absolutely pick up Monster Hunter World no questions asked.

Gir: I have 24 hours. 

Trog: I, I don’t even know how to get to mine.

Wayne: Baaulp?

Baaulp: 34.

Wayne: Log?

Log: 36. 

Wayne: Me? 65.

Trog: How do I even get to it?

Wayne: Trog?

Gir: [crosstalk] Go to your profile and look.

Trog: Wait, hang on. Okay, yeah I have 89 hours on Monster [crosstalk] Hunter World [laughing] so… like.

Wayne: Oh my god. I’m like- I’m like ten— I’m like twenty percent ashamed of 65 and you have SO MUCH.

Trog: I will, I will not lie, uh, Monster Hunter World is— or not Monster Hunter World, the Monster Hunter series is, at this point in my life, probably my favorite game series of all time.

Wayne: I don’t know, I’m so indecisive that I can’t say that for sure, but it is way up there. I’ve logged— I’ve logged, out of any video game ever, the most— the game I’ve logged the most hours into is probably still Dota 2. Uh… Not happy about that.

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: I’d probably take that back and put—

Baaulp: I’m happy about that.

Wayne: If I could put th— Hey, Baaulp, if I could put thirty three hundred hours into like, practicing the piano—

Trog, Gir: [laughter] 

Wayne: If I could just like, reallocate— 

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: —the fucking like, resources of that time?

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: I would be so much better off than having played Dota for thirty three—

Baaulp: See here’s the thing, if you enjoyed playing the piano you would have done that already, so the way I see it is like…

Wayne: No, I do enjoy playing the piano but I have executive dysfunction!

Trog: Now I’m like, now I’m like thinking about somebody playing the piano like how they play Dota so they like, get halfway through a song and fuck up and just get really pissed and start breaking all the keys.

Wayne: [gamer voice] FUCK! Shoulda played C man!

Gir: Uugh!

Trog: Shoulda played C! Fuck!

Wayne: Shoulda played C! 

Log: [laughter]

Trog: When are we getting competitive like—

Log: Beethoven’s got [unintelligible] battle chess!

Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: —competitive multiplayer piano. Five people sitting at the same keys, trying to play the same song.

Wayne: I— That probably already exists.

Gir: [mock yelling] Mom get out I’m playing a concerto!

Wayne: So is it like… So five people are sitting at the same keys playing the same song? [crosstalk] Are they like..

Trog: Yeah. 

Baaulp: [laughter]

Trog: They’re, they’re all trying to work together to play the same song. 

Wayne: Once a minute you can slap the other players’ hands… to mess them up.

Trog: No no, they’re working together to play the same song.

Baaulp: Yeah [crosstalk] yeah yeah it’s like Dota.

Wayne: You said competitive?

Trog: Yeah [crosstalk] it’s competitive against another piano.

Wayne: Ohhh you mean— so it’s 5v5? [crosstalk] Ohhhh.

Trog: Yeah, it’s 5v5 piano.

Baaulp: It’s— So imagine, imagine a battle of the bands where there’s a modified piano that se— seats five people, and the bands go up and they play songs and there’s like an audience that votes who won it, and that’s how it’s done.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: No, it’s a, it’s a piano except there’s keys at— on two sides—

Wayne and Trog: [laughter]

Log: —and there’s enough keys for five people on each side. 

Baaulp: [laughter]

Log: Also, the mallets are strapped together at the ends, so you have to fight [crosstalk] the other person to use the—

Trog, Baaulp: [laughter]

Trog: You have to press the key harder than the other team. [laughing]

Gir: Could you imagine someone going AFK during that?

Trog: [laughter]

Log: [laughing] They just go into a stupor.

Trog: [more laughter]

Gir: “Hold on guys, I’ll be AFK.” And they just [laughing] pass out.

Wayne: So wait… The mallets— [laughter] The mallets are tied together and like, and each p— and each team is matching each other so hard that you just don’t hear any notes because no one is actually able to hit it in time—

Baaulp, Log: [laughter]

Wayne: —and then finally someone like, manages to hit the fuckin’ note and you just hear [singular piano note]

Trog, Log: [laughter]

Wayne: Like you’ve— you’re there for two hours, you hear one note. 

Baaulp: Aaah niño rata! 

Trog, Wayne and Log: [laughter]

Trog: Alright.

Log: That makes no sense to er, anybody that doesn’t play Dota!

Trog: Yeah, it’s okay. 

Gir: It— I don’t know— I’m lost, so.

Trog: It’s alright. It’s all good.

Wayne: It didn’t make sense to me for about ten seconds! Ten seconds didn’t pass in that time, I—

Gir: Yeah I don’t play that game.

Trog: Uh, it’s okay, it’s rat boy.

Wayne: Niño rata!

Trog: It’s rat boy. Um—

Gir: Genius?

Wayne: Let’s- Let’s talk about the video we watched, uh, just before this podcast—

Baaulp: [laughter]

Wayne: —of the dude playing CSGO [crosstalk] and blowing up his keyboard.

Trog: Oh my god. I don’t even know if we need—

Log: Multiple times.

Trog: [laughing] I don’t know if we need to discuss that. [crosstalk] It’s really good though.

Wayne: That’ll be linked in the description. We don’t h— we don’t have anything to say, I’m just gonna link it in the description.

Trog: I think last time we just said like watch the Bardonic Ramen video so that, I guess that’ll be a thing where we’ll just say go watch a video and we’ll put it in the description. 

Wayne: It’s video of the day!

Baaulp: Video of the day for a podcast that’s like, once a month.

Wayne: Video of the week.

Trog: Yeah you know. Video of the time. Video of the times, that’s what it’s gonna be called.

Wayne: Video of the times.

Gir: Video of your time.

Log: [laughing] Yeah.

Gir: Whatever time it is for you, whatever day, month, year, century…

Wayne: Best video every.

Gir: Just watch it.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: What is that!?

Gir: I have to jump on this immediately, because I literally just thought about this yesterday. When I was young and we had a PlayStation 1, and that was still the hot, new item, my dad had a game for it, and it was just... I don't even know how to describe it. It was like an 8— [crosstalk] it was like an Aerosmith game—

Baaulp: What?

Gir: Where you like, attacked enemies with CDs.

Trog: Wh— hang on...

Gir: And there was a boss— there was a boss that was like, a mass of jelly.

Wayne: I've heard of this. I've absolutely heard of this.

Trog: What the hell... were you playing— you were playing AS Aerosmith?

Wayne: [crosstalk] Was this on the SNES?

Gir: I think you were— Uh, I just said "PlayStation", my friend.

Wayne: Oh, my bad.

Gir: [laughter]

Baaulp: Dude, this game sounds awesome! [crosstalk] But it probably plays like shit.

Gir: It was awesome! I loved it, but I can't remember shit! I remember it being rad as hell, because it was like— it played like, uh... you know those games that are at arcades where you have a light gun? Except it was with a controller instead.

Trog: Oh.

Baaulp: So it does play like shit.

Gir: It was fun! I liked it...

Wayne: When I was a kid, my dad had a lot of CDs, and a lot of DVDs. And he— he— we— he— we used to have this just— giant, like— do you remember, like— these, the like— zipped up, like— books, that you could just fill with CD sleeves?

Trog: Yeah, [crosstalk] I have one.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Gir: Yeah.

Trog: I still have one in my living room.

Wayne: Yeah, my dad had one of those, and it was just full of all kinds of goodies and— and— and whatnot.

Log: Gizmos! [crosstalk] And gadgets!

Wayne: Goodies and gizmos!

Baaulp: Any— any naughty videos?

Wayne: Of course not. [crosstalk] I was four, Baaulp.

Gir: That happened to me.

Baaulp: Oh no.

Gir: [laughter]

Wayne: Oh, I have a little story about something naughty, like— not hap— ah fuck, whatever. [crosstalk] I dunno what I'm sayin'.

Gir: We'll save that for later. [laughter]

Wayne: Yeah. I've got a naughty story...

Trog, Wayne: [laughter]

Wayne: So... one of the games in the zip-up CD sleeve book, was um— a— it was— it was called like, Water Slide Blast,  or Water Slide Heaven, [crosstalk] or Water Slide—

Baaulp: What?

Wayne: I think it was called Water Slide World, and it was a PC game, and it was just like— you would play— you would pick a kid, and you'd go down a water slide, and it was like, so much fun. All you did was just move left and right, I'm pretty sure, to like, grab stuff. And you could like, increase your speed, and you'd go up and down these crazy water slides. And I think the gameplay was probably ass, but I loved it because it was just like— I was a kid, and I was like, "I wanna ride a water slide, I'm gonna play Water Slide World instead!" But the one thing I'll never forget about it, is at the end of the level, like— if you didn't do good enough, your— you would ride your water slide into a black hole and the child would be gone.

Trog: What?

Gir: That's how the real world works, man!

Log: Uh...

Wayne: Not like, violently— it wasn't like, Game Over, I just remember like— at the end of the water slide, you can either go into the pool, or ride into a black hole. I remember that specifically.

Trog: Oh!

Gir: Which would you choose?

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: Black hole.

Gir: Yeah.

Trog: Eh...

Wayne: If it didn't kill me!

Log: Um...

Wayne: If there was a sign on the ride that said, "There's a black hole at the end. Don't worry, you won't die. It's just fun", I would go in.

Baaulp: [laughter]

Gir: [crosstalk] That sounds like a trick if I've ever heard one.

Wayne: They'd have to assure me. I mean— if there's— okay. If there's a black hole at the end of the water slide, you're already dead. [crosstalk] Because it's a black hole.

Trog: No, it's just a really small one. It's okay.

Wayne: And the earth would be gone.

Log: So, I kinda got two. One of 'ems kind of a all-encompassing one for all of us, [crosstalk] so I'll start with the one that's just me.

Trog: Oh, I hope it's not the one that I was gonna say.

Gir: [laughter]

Log: I played— well, I guess we'll see. Anyways. So, whenever I was a kid, I had One Piece: Grand Battle! for the GameCube. I played it a lot, it was just a top-down arena fighter where you played as One Piece characters. And I didn't really watch a lot of One Piece as a child, because it only aired on Toonami at like, 9 PM or whatever, and I was too busy doing kid things to watch it at a scheduled time. But, I had that game, and it had the characters in it, and I had fun playing it, I knew the cheat codes to unlock all the characters. And now that I think about it, as like, somebody who's now read every single chapter of One Piece and is just, like, a really big fan of it, the thing that really stuck with me is that— I just remember Zoro doing a bunch of moves that he never had.

Trog: [laughter]

Log: Like, I remember— you'd like, pick up a diamond and you'd gain access to your special move. And the special moves would be, like, cinematics that were actually, like, moves from the series, and stuff. But the opener move— the opener that would get you into the cinematic were just bullshit. And I remember specifically— and I remember thinking about this earlier today, even— 

Log: Zoro, whenever he would pick up the diamond and activate his super, he would just go, "CRAB GRAB! DRAGON TWISTER! BULL CHARGE!" and then he would do his actual moves. And like, Dragon Twister's a real move, but I have no idea what the fuck they were thinking.

Wayne: "CORN PUNCH!"

Trog: "Crab Grab?"

Log: "Crab Grab!", yeah. And it would make a picture of a crab on screen.

Trog: Wow.

Gir: Hyper-realistic, and it would take up the screen for 3 hours.

Trog: [crosstalk] And then blood would come out of my TV.

Trog: And then Luffy looked at me and said, "You will die in 45 seconds."

Log: But for whatever reason, [crosstalk] I just think about "Crab Grab" like once a week.

Wayne: "Silly Slap!"

Trog: That's a good, good term.

Wayne: Was this a 4Kids endorsed game?

Baaulp: Probably.

Trog: Yeah, for sure.

Log: Yeah. It was such a 4Kids endorsed game, that it was like, fucked up for the US release. The Japanese version had, um... Afro Luffy, Enel, Aokiji, uh, and, like, Foxy and stuff. And those just like, weren't in the game.

Wayne: They cut it out because it wasn't in the American version.

Log: Yeah, they advertised the game with Afro Luffy, and then it came out, and he just wasn't  part of it.

Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: That's bizarre.

Gir: Nice.

Log: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Wayne: Did it have 4Kids voices? [crosstalk] Oh!

Log: Um... yeah.

Wayne: [4Kids Sanji voice] So you had Sanji, who sounded like this. [crosstalk] "Neck Shot!"

Log: Yeah. That's another one I remember. Whenever Sanji had to fight a female character, he would just go like, [4Kids Sanji voice] "Oh, I can't stop! What have I done?"

Wayne, Baaulp, Gir: [laughter]

Trog: What!? That's fucked up! You can't put that in a game!

Wayne: [4Kids Sanji voice] "I can't stop! What have I done?"

Log: Whenever he would do his combos, yeah. [crosstalk] That was just what he would say.

Trog: That's fucked.

Wayne: That's really funny.

Trog: It's no good.

Log: But yeah— the other one I think, like, is true for all of us, is King's Quest 5.

Trog: Oh, yeah. King's Quest 5 is great.

Log: More than— more people than there really should be are aware of King's Quest 5, just because like, [crosstalk] Retsupurae went through it, and stuff.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: We watched one video, [crosstalk] and I think it's a Vinesauce video, even.

Wayne: It's— it's Rev, from— it's Rev from— from Vinesauce. So it's not super obscure.

Log: It's not super obscure, but it is, like, old media that nobody really thinks about, usually.

Wayne: That has completely been ingrained in our brains. We reference this shit, like, all the time.

Log: Yeah, that video— it's basically King's Quest 5, but all of the audio files fucked up and play at the wrong times.

Wayne: They've been completely scrambled. They all still work.

Trog: But they play in the wrong place.

Log: Yeah, it'll just like, play a stream of random audio files to fill up the amount of time that there's supposed to be audio at any given point. And it's just like, filled with so much good stuff. There's so many good lines in King's Quest 5, and they're even better whenever they say them at the wrong time.

Trog: They're just completely removed from all context. It's just great.

Log: Graham just like, walks up to a squirrel, and goes, "Will a gold coin do? Will a gold needle do?"

Wayne: No! The squirrel says it to him!

Trog: Yeah!

Log: Oh yeah! It says it to him in his voice. And it's just like— like, I feel like we just constantly say to each other, "Will a gold coin do? [crosstalk] Will a gold needle do?"

Trog: "You need one gold coin!"

Wayne: "It costs one gold coin to see Madame Mushka!"

Log: And just like, "No more for today!" and then a death scream.

Wayne: The fuckin'— it's not only just great lines out of context, its just like... great ideas. Multiple characters describe Graham's death to him. Like, "Too bad Graham's swimming skills were no match for the mighty river", like that happens multiple times.

Log: And then the fucking finale, where a person just punches a hole in a rock, [crosstalk] and just peers through—

Wayne: It's like a frail woman.

Log: Yeah, just like a woman peers through a hole in a wall, and just like a portion of her shows up for a split second, and just says, "Graham."

Trog: And then leaves!

Wayne: She like, sticks her head in the wall, does that, and pulls it back in.

Log: It's a little bit more-known than, like, the super obscure shit, but I don't know how many communities you'll find out there where people will just say to each other, "Will a gold coin do?"

Wayne: If you've never seen it, go on YouTube, look up King's Quit Audio Swap, and it'll come up immediately. It's very easy to find, it's not that obscure.

Log: Yeah. [crosstalk] Alright, now it's Trog's time! Trog, go!

Trog: It's my turn? Okay. Well, here's the thing. I'm gonna say mine, I don't know how deep we'll get into it, because I think that we've all talked about maybe doing something with this at some point in the future, we just haven't gotten around to it.

Wayne: I wouldn't even talk about it, honestly.

Trog: I have to— I don't— that's like... that is the answer to the question, for me.

Wayne: But then people are gonna look it up, [crosstalk] and they're not gonna be reveal— you can't reveal it.

Log: Oh no. You can't!

Wayne: We all know what he's saying!

Log: I know what you're saying now, and you can't.

Trog: Really!?

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Yeah.

Gir: I don't.

Wayne: Because— because it'll come to them in such a greater fashion. [crosstalk] We should do that soon.

Trog: If we actually do it! You have to promise me that we'll actually do something, then.

Wayne: Absolutely! I've been wanting to do that forever! Erarg needs to get a better mic, first.

Trog: Alright, well then come back to me, because I need to come up with something else to answer this question with.

Wayne: Baaulp, do you have one?

Baaulp: Yeah, I have a ton. This is, like— obscure media is like my life. I love crap.

Gir: [laughter]

Baaulp: I love crap. I love consuming digital crap. I'll put "digital" in front so people don't get any wrong ideas.

Wayne: You already just said "I love crap", that can be iso'd.

Log: [laughter] "I love crap!"

Wayne: He's gonna edit it now.

Trog, Gir, Baaulp: [laughter]

Baaulp: Yeah, I'm gonna edit myself saying "I love crap". Oh no!

Log: Yeah, get him!

Baaulp: Uh, no. One of my favorite bands, Devo, they are... they have, like, their tendrils in everything. They... they—

Wayne: Gross.

Baaulp: Devo and/or Mark Mothersbaugh have done, or just worked on, everything. You'll find Devo or like... Mark Mothersbaugh, in particular's, name on a whole bunch of stuff. Like, he did the soundtrack for Thor: Ragnarok. He did the music for Peewee's Playhouse. He did the music for Jak & Daxter. Like, everything. Like, every— Rugrats, everything. There's this period in like, I think the late 80's, early 90's, where I guess Devo wasn't doing so great. And so they just like— I wanna say they took advantage of it, and just did weird stuff? They wrote a song for a movie called Doctor Detroit or something like that? And like, the song they wrote for it is not super good, but it's catchy... and it's like, dumb. I like it. They also made a game— like Devo made a game called Smart Patrol? And I wanna find a legit copy and play it. Or find a way to download and play it. Because it's a game where you play as this band called The Smart Patrol, I think. And your goal is to rescue Devo, which has been kidnapped. Like your goal is to rescue the band. And they wrote original music for, like— Devo wrote original music for the game AS The Smart Patrol themselves, or some weird shit like that. So yeah, there's that. I need to find that game and play it. And like, growing up, whenever a relative would go to China, they would always bring back— I never did it, for some reason. I don't know why. I don't think I just ever thought of it, when I was on vacation. But my relatives would bring back, like, bootleg GBA cartridges. [crosstalk] Like the ones that have the 101 games in them.

Trog: Oh, great.

Gir: Oh, fuck yeah.

Baaulp: Those always had, like... the WORST games. Now that I think about it, I gotta, like, hit up my cousin, and just see if I can buy some of those cartridges off him. Because I wanna play some of those. Those had like— I remember going to his house, just playing those GBA games, and like— some of those games were legitimately good, I just didn't know what they were, because they were in untranslated Japanese. But they were fun games. If we're talking just media, and not games— the weird thing is... I've played games, but I haven't played too many weird, obscure games. My friend Spencer, the wasp guy we talked about last episode, he had a copy of Cookie & Cream, which was a PS2 game where you and a friend were supposed to play with the same controller, I think. It was like... [crosstalk] it kinda had Katamari vibes going.

Trog: Dude, that's cool.

Baaulp: But the idea was you would hold each side of the controller, and it was like a puzzle... platformer-ish game, where both of you are on separate tracks, and the goal is just to get from— to run from the background to the foreground. It was kinda like uh, like Crash Bandicoot where you're just running forward. But there'd be obstacles and puzzles, and if you do something on your side, it would like, open the gate on the other side, and one person would be Cookie, and the person would be Cream, like two rabbits. And the goal was to, like, get to the end basically. It was like a super cute, weird game. We didn't play too much, because it honestly wasn't that fun, but it was a neat idea. And I think it's one of those rare games, that you don't— you never see people talk about. [crosstalk] Man, more obscure—

Gir: Man, that gameplay sounded a lot like Portal 2 co-op.

Baaulp: It kinda was like that, yeah! Except you were, like, cognizant of each other the entire time, because you shared a screen.

Trog: I have mine now, [crosstalk] and it's less of a specific—

Baaulp: [crosstalk] One last thing. Inspector Black Cat.

Trog: Oh, okay.

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Sorry.

Gir: [laughter]

Trog: Oh yeah, Inspector Black Cat is good. That's a good one. Anyway. So, I have two. The first one may not, uh... count. Because it's less of A video, and more of just a GENRE of video, which we all— we all enjoy, and I think it definitely— well, it absolutely falls under the category of "obscure media", but it is the timeless pastime of going onto YouTube, searching up any combination of words you can think of, and sorting by Most Recently Uploaded. You will find so many 10-year-olds with a webcam.

Wayne: So much garbage, like actual garbage, and then also so much good garbage.

Trog: [crosstalk] There's like—

Gir: You find gems in there.

Wayne: We've seen countless videos called "video games in real life".

Trog: Oh my god.

Wayne: And some of them are like... the funniest fucking thing. You could— you could play a drinking game that would kill you if you looked up those videos, and you took a drink every time you saw a kid punching a tree, [crosstalk] that, like—

Trog: Yep.

Log: Hey...

Trog, Wayne: What?

Log: You know what I just realized? We have an audience, [crosstalk] we can post a bounty.

Trog: Okay.

Gir: A bounty...

Gir: [crosstalk] Oh, yeah!

Wayne: That video— so that video is one of the funniest ones, I'm pretty sure that one's gone forever.

Trog: If you can find that one...

Log: Like, okay— it's probably gone forever, but if you know where that is...

Wayne: If you can find that one, you can be on the podcast.

Trog: Good fucking luck finding any video titled "video games in real life", because like Wayne said, I don't think I really understood the magnitude of garbage that gets uploaded to YouTube on a fucking, like... minute by minute basis. Like, it is ridiculous. If you've never sorted by Recently Uploaded on YouTube, you should absolutely do it just to like... take in the fact that YouTube servers are getting attacked second by second by garbage. Just complete and utter unwatchable, disgusting, worthless trash of data.

Wayne: I am now imagining, like, Google's headquarters having speakers that plays the audio of every video being uploaded to it at once.

Gir: So it's just static, then.

Wayne: Yeah, and I just imagine the fucking workers, like, covering their ears, and like, dying from the sonic attack.

Gir: Now see, I did this just this morning. I went on, and I just searched "my funny joke", and then sorted by the most recent upload, and I got a kid who was like, "Hey, sorry if you watched my video the other day, it said I was quitting YouTube and it's not a joke. That was a joke."

Trog: [laughter] See, it's just garbage!

Log: My favorite is just to, uh... [crosstalk] type in phrases but spell them wrong intentionally.

Trog: Oh yeah, that's great.

Gir: Oh hell yeah.

Log: I think one of my most productive ones was, uh, "don't wach this", where it's like, "don't watch this", but instead of "watch", I spell "w-a-c-h".

Trog: Yeah.

Log: That produced a video that I have, at least at one time, donated to Wayne on his stream.

Wayne: [laughter]

Log: It's just like, a fuckin— it's a kid playing the drum, [crosstalk] but he's inside a cup or something, it sounds terrible.

Trog: It's like, impossible to describe what that video is. Because there's so many layers. The webcam, or whatever they're using to record, is super low quality. The audio recording... it sounds like, like— cup doesn't even do it justice. I don't even know... it's so low bitrate, and he's like, playing the drums, but not really? Like, he's hitting the drums super quietly, it's— it's honestly super bizarre. We should put a link to that in the fucking description too.

Wayne: [crosstalk] Hey, that video's great—

Log: Yeah, "this video don't wach".

Wayne: The reason I laughed is because I just wanted to prove this theory, and I just search "dumb kid" in YouTube, click the last hour, and I found out that within the last hour, there's a video of a child called "brock awesome is a stupid rock", and its a picture of a boulder, and then like 3 seconds into the video, a picture of this kids face, like terribly chroma-keyed, fades in on top of the rock, and it starts playing the Wombo Combo video's audio? [crosstalk] Let me— I'll link this to you guys really quick.

Trog: [laughter] What? Yeah. See— [crosstalk] see, that kinda stuff—

Baaulp: Spicy, pepsi, [crosstalk] like a hot lady. 

Trog: [crosstalk] Alright, hang on, we're— we're gonna take a—

Baaulp: [crosstalk] Spicy, pepsi, like a triple grand duke.

Trog: See, that's actually— that's a famous video. [crosstalk] That's not even obscure.

Baaulp: Oh, really?

Wayne: [crosstalk] Yeah, that's not obscure.

Gir: [crosstalk] Yeah, that's not obscure at all.

Log: [crosstalk] Yeah. That's not obscure.

Baaulp: Oh, okay. 

Wayne: [crosstalk] Pepsi, spicy.

Baaulp: How about that video that's just 4 kids, uh... like, moving.

Trog: What?

Baaulp: I don't even know how to describe it.

Wayne: Wait, are you referring to the one called, like, "kids in the park", where they move and it goes like, "BRRRRRHGHGH"?

Baaulp: Uh, no no no, I'll look it up.

Wayne: We should move on, I think. We've been talking about this for 25 minutes.

Trog: Well, this was a good question, but um... to continue my other one, and we won't spend a whole lot of time on this one, because I think this will just be another one you really have to look up to get the full experience of... and actually, I guess, well— it's a private video now, so I dunno, maybe you can't even see it, [crosstalk] without the link.

Baaulp: Oh... should we even talk about it?

Trog: What? It's "Fres".

Baaulp: Oh, okay.

Trog: If you've never seen "Fres", do yourself a favor and find it somehow, because it's— it's...

Log: I mean, it's just unlisted, right? We can post a link to "Fres", probably.

Trog: Yeah, we can post a link to "Fres". We'll post a link to "Fres", there's not much to say about it, just because it's entirely incomprehensible. Have fun. Just watch it.

Wayne: It's so incomprehensible, that the person who made it, couldn't even make subtitles for their own words.

Trog: Yeah. It'll all make sense when you watch it, just trust me. Go watch "Fres".

Wayne: Alright, what's the next question?

Wayne: Oreo O's.

Trog: Oreo O's?

Gir: They brought those back.

Trog: Really?

Wayne: I don't— I don't eat cereal NOW.

Gir: Oh.

Baaulp: The ship has sailed! He doesn't eat cereal anymore.

Gir: This is a very, very, very easy question for me. It's uh... Dem Bones.

Trog: What's that?

Gir: It was a— it was just candy shaped like bones, and I got it every Halloween, and then one year they just stopped making it, and I was fucking LIVID.

Baaulp: It got banned 'cause kids were eating bones.

Trog: Too violent.

Baaulp: They were eating bones, expecting it to taste like the candy.

Gir: [crosstalk] It was basically Sweet Tarts—

Wayne: No, I was eating it, expecting it to taste like bones.

Gir: It was basically Sweet Tarts in the shape of bones, but it was the fact of the matter of, that was my Halloween candy, god damn it, and they fucking took it from me.

Wayne: You didn't deserve it.

Gir: I deserve those bones! I want Dem Bones!

Wayne: Mmm, nah... just eat Sweet Tarts. Um—

Gir: But they're not bone-shaped! You don't get it!

Wayne: Burger King is the worst fast food place, I think that's agreeable overall.

Trog: I agree.

Gir: Mhmm. Yep.

Trog: Sonic is definitely bottom three.

Wayne: Sonic has— for burgers, yeah. I like Sonic's ice cream, and Sonic has mozzarella sticks. That's like, really, it's two— it's two pluses.

Trog: 99% of Sonic's menu is hot trash, and it's got like 1% good.

Wayne: True, true. True.

Gir: Focus...

Wayne: Um— [laughter]

Trog: That's— 

Wayne: Why did— Why did you say—

Trog: —should have answered that for the last question, but it's too late now.

Wayne: [laughter] Um—

Log: Yeah.

Wayne: —but, Burger King used to be, like, at the top of the food chain for fast food. Back in the day, when I was in middle school, they had, uh, BK Burger Shots, which were just, like— it was Burger Shots, you know what those are, a little tiny burgers—

Trog: Like a slider, right?

Wayne: Yeah! It was sliders, but it was, like, eight sliders— 

Trog: Woah.

Wayne: —like— like— like— like almost, like, connected with, like, um, like break off points and you would just rip them apart and, uh, eat them one by one and it was— it was so good. It was better than anything else they had, and they never brought it back.

Trog: Aw.

Bauulp: Probably— probably for logistics. You'd have to, like, get bread in that shape and, like, patties in that shape.

Wayne: What other fast food items have gone way of the wind that—

Trog: What? Actually, yeah. I was about to say mine is a— also a fast food item from Taco Bell. It is the Loaded Potato Griller, which they don't—

Wayne: It's still there!

Trog: It's not there, right?

Wayne: It just doesn't have bacon in it anymore.

Trog: Yeah. It's not the same. It's not the same without the bacon.

Wayne: I think you can add bacon. I—I think they might still have bacon. 

Trog: Well, I don't want to pay extra for bacon. 

Trog: It's not on the menu. You can't go and order a Loaded Potato Griller. T hey'll tell you they don't have it anymore, so it counts.

Wayne: It's called the Cheesy Potato Griller now and it [crosstalk]

Trog: Yeah, it's not loaded anymore! Bullshit. I get that, too. It's okay, but it's not a Loaded Potato Griller.

Wayne: It's still okay.

Log: Yeah. I always get a— I just— I just get a Beefy Fritos Burrito.

Wayne: You know, I've changed— my— my Taco Bell order is slowly changing. Uh, the other day, they accidentally gave me a Shredded Chicken Burrito instead of a Shredded Chicken Mini Quesadilla, and that shit was pretty good, and I've been ordering that now.

Gir: [laughter]

Trog: Betrayer.

Baaulp: They got you.

Log: I went to a combination Taco Bell and Long John's Silvers this weekend.

Trog: Wow, that's disgusting.

Log: And I walked in not knowing that. I thought it was just a Taco Bell, and it looked like— it got, like, bitten by a Long John's Silvers mosquito or something.

Baaulp, Trog: [laughter]

Log: There was like a rash slowly taking over the store 'cause there was just like a small section of Long John's Silvers aesthetic in the entire building, and the rest of it was just Taco Bell.

Trog: Hm.

Gir: That's weird.

Wayne: It's a Taco Bell with one fish on the wall.

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: It's— It's to— It's like an organism that, like— that, like, it's slowly taking over, you mean?

Log: Yeah, it was like a— it's like a parasite.

Baaulp: Who's winning? Who's winning?

Log: Taco Bell for sure 'cause they had the majority of the store.

Baaulp: Okay.

Log: But, I think in the end we all lost, though, because I got, like, a Beefy Fritos Burrito that kind of tasted like wood.

Trog: Eugh.

Baaulp: Eugh.

Gir: [laughing]

Wayne: Mm. That sounds good.

Log: Yeah, um—

Trog: No, no that’s bad, Wayne.

Wayne: I like the taste of wood. 

Log: Anyways—

Wayne: Like, I’d like a stick.

Log: Anyways, that’s enough talking shit on Taco Bell. 

Trog: [laughter]

Log: I’m about to talk shit about Whataburger because—

Trog: Oh, yeah.

Wayne: Uh, I have to tune this out because this doesn’t exist where I live.

Trog: This is for y— for all you southern boys out there!

Log: Yeah. All— all— all them— all them cowboy— all those cowpokes out there. Uh, what the fuck are they doing having a Buffalo Ran— Bu—

Trog: Oo, yeah.

Log: I can’t— I’m so— I’m so mad, I can’t even say straight!

Wayne: What are they doing having a buffalo ranch?

Trog: [laughter]

Gir: Who are they ??? those there?

Wayne: Let those— let those buffalo free!

Log: Why the fuck do they have the Buffalo Ranch Chicken Strip Sandwich just randomly going off their menu? Is it—

Trog: They— that’s what they do. They rotate out sandwiches—

Wayne: It— that’s what every fast food place does, though.

Trog: —and it sucks.

Log: Well—

Wayne: Literally every fast food place does, though.

Log: This is the only recurring sandwich that happens at Whataburger as far as I can tell because, like, there’s, the static menu items that never change, there’s the ones that are there for, like, half a second and then they’re gone like the, uh, Chorizo stuff that they had.

Trog: Eugh.

Log: And then there’s the Buffalo Chicken Strip Sandwich which appears, like, once every quarter, and is then gone. It’s like a fucking rare—

Trog: Yeah.

Log: —Pokemon or something.

Trog: Yeah, exactly. I was about to say it’s like a Shiny Burger, you know?

Baaulp, Gir, Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: It’s— like, one out of every thousand times that you go through the drive through, it’ll be there.

Wayne: Why are they not making the Shiny Burger? [crosstalk]

Trog: [laughter]

Log: They also— they also never advertise it and—

Trog: Yeah, it’s like a— it’s like a prize. 

Log: —never say whenever it’s there.

Trog: It’s like, “Congratulations. You came on the right day. Here’s your Chicken Strips.”

Wayne: [laughter]

Log: I just go in and ask for it every time because I have no idea whenever it’s there.

Trog: [laughing] Just in case they’re hiding it from you.

Wayne: Hey. I’m— I’m switching back to Taco Bell for a sec. Do you— I don’t go inside Taco Bell anymore.

Trog: No, never.

Wayne: Do they still have— do they still have—

Baaulp: Chairs?

Wayne: —th— those things— yeah, chairs?

Log: [laughing] Do they still have people?

Wayne: Can you s—

Log: Do they still have tacos?

Wayne: Do— do they still— [laughing] They still have— they still have beef?

Log, Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: The— no. Do they— do they still have those things that you could, like, drop coins into and you had to, like, land it on a, like, platform? You know what I’m talking about?

Baaulp: What?

Gir: Register?

Trog: No idea what you’re talking about right now.

Baaulp: [laughing] Register?

Wayne: The—

Log, Trog, Wayne: [laughter]

Wayne: No! At— every Taco Bell had this back in the day. Back when I worked there, when I was in high school, and back when I used to go there, like, religiously with my friends back when we were fucking, like, Mountain Dew Dorito fiends for whatever reason. Um, the, uh— and they used to have this thing that was like— it was like a plastic cylinder, and it had a rod in the middle, and attached to that rod were, like, more plastic little, like, platforms and there was a slot for a coin, and you had to drop a coin in there and land it on a specific platform. And, like, depending on what platform you land it on, if you did it, you just got a free item. 

Like, because—

Trog: Wow.

Wayne: —the coins would be donated, uh, to, like, charity, so you’d— if you dropped— if you— if you landed a quarter on one of the, uh— on one of the platforms, like, you got a free burrito. If you landed, like, a dime on there, you got a free taco. If you landed a free nickel on there, you get, like, Cinnamon Twists.

Log: Land a free nickel on there.

Wayne: The, uh— you get— if you landed a free nickel on there—

Log: [laughing] Can I get a free nickel?

Wayne: Y— [laughter]

Log: Please? I never asked before.

Wayne: The— and, like, it was so hard. I don't know if they still have it.

Trog: It was a scam.

Log: I think you, uh— I think you worked at a combination casino and Taco Bell.

Trog, Wayne: [laughter]

Wayne: One of them, uh, like— I— I remember— I— one of the options was a Bean Burrito, and I remember, like, they didn’t have rules policing this, so if you were good at it, you could eat free forever pretty much.

Baaulp, Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: Like, I remember— 

Baaulp: Probably why it went away.

Wayne: I remember seeing— I remember this— I-I have a specific memory working at a Taco Bell, working at this Taco Bell, of some dude coming in and he did it three times and was just like, “Yeah.” He did it, like, three times in a row confidently and was like, “Yeah, three Bean Burritos.” 

Trog: Damn.

Wayne: And he pointed at the fucking coins in it, and, uh— and we were just like, “Okay.” and, like, the manager came out and, like, give— gave him a funny look, but just— we did it anyways because, like, there’s no— there’s no rule that says, like, “You cannot do this three times.” If you do it, you do it. We have to follow the policy. 

And, that reminds me. Tac— so, like— nyeh, nevermind.

Gir: Yeah, hold off, I wanna hear what Baaulp’s food is.

Wayne: ‘Cause I’ve— I’ve— I’ve been going about Taco Bell for a while.

Baaulp: This is gonna be very anticlimactic. I don’t eat a lot of fast food. I can’t think of a single thing—

Gir: It’s not fast food only.

Trog: It doesn’t have to be fast food—

Gir: It’s just anything.

Trog: But, it can be anything.

Baaulp: I can’t— I can’t think of a single thing—

Wayne: No candies? No ???

Baaulp: —that I have lost—

Gir: [laughter]

Trog: [laughing] Okay.

Baaulp: —when it comes to food.

Gir: Baaulp’s never experienced loss before.

Baaulp: There’s— there’s no—

Wayne: [laughter]

Baaulp: There’s no candy, there’s no food item that I, like, miss that I can’t get anymore. Like, legit— like, legit. I’m not— I’m serious.

Trog: I think what that means is that Baaulp has the greatest taste of all time because everything he eats is so good, it never goes away. It never goes out of fast fashion.

Baaulp: [laughter]

Gir: Fair enough.

Trog: He’s got the perfect taste.

Baaulp: Like, even the stuff I don’t eat too much anymore— I used to eat, like, uh— I used to get a lot of, like, uh, the Spicy Chicken DiGiorno's pizzas. Those are still being sold, I think.

Trog: Yeah, probably.

Baaulp: I used to have a lot of, like, the White Rabbit, like, milk candies that, like, y— that are, like, import, and it—

Wayne: U— I— that took me a fucking second to wrap my head around what the fuck you were talking about because I heard all of that not as a brand, or a shape, but as an ingredient. So—

Baaulp: [laughter]

Wayne: —White Rabbit milk candy, I was, like, ‘“What the fuck are you talking about?” There’s— there’s a— there’s rabbit meat and milk—

Trog, Baaulp: [laughter]

Wayne: —made into a candy?

Trog: Gross.

Baaulp: But, no. Yeah, yeah, White Rabbit is the brand, and it’s like, milk— imagine, like, it’s a m— it’s like a sweet, like— imagine, like, condensed milk, but it has, like, the consistenc— it’s— it’s a little softer, it’s got, like, the consistency of, like, toffee. It’s good sh— it’s good stuff.

Gir: Yeah, yeah, no— they’re kinda cheap.

Baaulp: Yeah, they’re s— they’re everywhere still. Like, that’s the stuff I like, so—

Gir: Kinda shitty.

Baaulp: —no-nothing I like is gone, so yeah, you guys need better taste obviously. [laughter]

Gir: Hm.

Trog: Alright, yeah. Baaulp— Baaulp laying— laying it down, saying it like it is.

Gir: And, before— before we move off of this one question because it’s still related to food. Wayne reminded me of something. He said, like, he got— Wayne, you said you got the wrong thing and now you just eat that a lot?

Wayne: Yeah.

Gir: When I was a kid— every story I have is when I was a kid.

Trog: [laughter]

Gir: [laughing] When I was a kid, we were going, like, down— we were going down the street, and I looked into a ???— a window, and it was, like, a restaurant, and I s— looked— I saw a pizza someone was eating.

Wayne: Stole it.

Trog: Took it right out of their mouth.

Gir: Before this, I had never seen a pizza that had black olives on it.

Trog: I totally— okay, not to interrupt, but totally thought you were about to say, “I’d never seen a pizza before.”

Baaulp, Log, Wayne: [laughter]

Gir: I’ve never seen a pizza before.

Log: I’ve in fact seen, uh, three hundred million pizzas.

Trog: “What is this meat and bread and cheese and sauce?!”

Gir, Wayne: [laughter]

Gir: But, I’d never seen black olives on a pizza before, so I was like, “Oh my gosh, I wanna try that.” and I’d tell— I told my mom, I was like—

Wayne: “Oh my gosh.”

Gir: —”Hey, I wanna have— I wanna have one of those pizzas. A Black Olive Pizza.” and she was like, “What are you talking about?” And by the time she looked in the window, they— they— they just weren’t there.

Wayne: They ate the pizza. They finished it. Your mom didn’t believe you that a Black Olive Pizza was real.

Trog: [laughter]

Gir: She— a— ‘cause just the way I was describing, I was like, “I want a Black Olive Pizza. Let’s have a Black Olive Pizza.” She was like—

Wayne: “What are you talking about?

Gir: “What?”

Wayne: “What are olives?”

Gir: Exactly.

Trog: She thought you got fucking possessed—

Gir: S— [laughter]

Trog: —because you’d have to be possessed by a ghost to put black olives on your pizza, you freak.

Gir: Hey, you shut the fuck up.

Log: Black olives are foolish.

Wayne: I’ve never had an oli—

Trog: Too salty.

Gir: We go in and ther— she’s like, “Well, he wants some, like, Black Olive Pizza thing.” and they’re like, “Oh, he just wants some ch— like, bread with cheese and black olives.” And they say that to me.

Trog: What?

Gir: And I’m a kid. I’m like, “Uh, yeah. I guess. That sounds like pizza to me.”

Trog: [laughing] Why would they ask a child?

Gir: You know what they bring out to me?

Trog: What?

Baaulp: What?

Gir: Bruschetta.

Trog: What? How did they get confused?

Gir: They bring out fucking— I don’t know, but they bring out some fucking Bruschetta.

Wayne: They even have olives in them?

Gir: I was like— yeah. And I was like, “What the fuck? This isn’t pizza.” And I eat it, and I’m like, “I didn’t want the pizza anyway. This is good.” [laughter]

Trog: [laughter] I still think you’re a freak for liking black olives.

Gir: Now I fucking love Bruschetta.

Wayne: Hey, hey. I’ve never had an olive. Am I missing anything?

Trog: No.

Baaulp: No.

Gir: Green or black?

Log: Don’t bother.

Trog: They’re gross.

Baaulp: Olives suck. I hate them.

Wayne: Okay.

Trog: They’re like salty little death pods.

Gir: You guys are fucking pussies. I love olives.

Trog: Too salty.

Wayne: I’m a pussy because I like to eat good food and not bad.

Log: They’re like—

Gir: Fucking—

Log: —grapes for idiots.

Trog: Yeah, they’re, like, wrong grapes.

Gir: Whatever.

Baaulp: Next question!

Wayne: No. No, no, no. I have a topic. Let’s talk about foods that you can’t understand why anyone else eats. Why would you ever eat a pear? It’s just a worse apple.

Gir, Trog, Log: [laughter]

Baaulp: What? No. They don’t taste the same at all. Next question! I’m gonna revoke—

Trog: Alright.

Baaulp: —your chan— that’s so stupid!

Log: Should pears die?

Gir: Guess.

Trog: Who wants— who wants to start? [laughter]

Wayne: [laughter]

Baaulp: Yeah, Gir, tell us how you—

Trog: Yeah, Gir. Where’d you get your username from?

Baaulp: —got your username.

Wayne: It’s— it’s short for Girth.

Gir: I was in a dollar store and I saw a book, and the guy’s last name was Gir and I was like, “I’m his master now.”

Baaulp, Trog, Wayne: [laughter]

Baaulp: Alright, there you go.

Wayne: You fucked up child. You wanted to dominate this random man?

Gir: [laughing] Yeah.

Trog: For— for the record, I don’t think anybody knows because we— we always introduce him as Gir, but Gir’s— Gir’s full username is MasterGir, so—

Gir: Yeah.

Trog: That joke doesn’t work unless you know that.

Baaulp: I got my username because I had to make an account name— I had to make a new username for YouTube Forums, and I couldn’t think of anything, so I closed my eyes, typed in five random keys on my keyboard, and this is what I got.

Log: Typed in five random, and wound up with six letters.

Trog, Wayne, Gir: [laughing]

Log: And that’s why you’re Baaulp.

Baaulp: [laughing] Oh, did I get the number of letters wrong?

Wayne: Wait, no, that’s— hey! No. Baaulp was correc— Baaulp was correct, he said, “Five random keys.” He hit ‘A’ twice.

Trog: He did. He— he did hit ‘A’ twice.

Log: Uh— That— that’s true.

Trog: That’s true.

Wayne: Alright, well, I just blew up Log. He’s banned from podcasting.

Gir: [laughter]

Log: Yeah.

Wayne: Okay—

Trog: Podcast jail.

Wayne: Log, you can’t say why you got your name.

Log: Alright.

Wayne: Because then you’ll dox yourself.

Log: I won’t tell you.

Baaulp, Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: I mean, okay.

Gir: I think that answers—

Trog: Welp, Wayne, do you wanna go then?

Gir: —it in in of itself.

Wayne: Uh, I can’t either.

Gir: Yes, you can.

Baaulp: You— why not?

Trog: What?

Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: Why can’t—?

Log: [laughter]

Gir: I will tell your name story—

Log: He’ll dox himself.

Gir: —for you.

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: I— well, I’ve been—been— went by many names. I’ve gone by many names in my E-Life. My first one was ‘Crazy Romeo’ when I—

Baaulp, Gir, Trog, Log: [laughter]

Wayne: —played Toontown as a child.

Trog: Hell yeah.

Wayne: But there was— there was a lot of progression. Arconos(?) arc, and then I was, like— when I was a kid, I— not when I was a kid. I was like a preteen. I realized, uh— I started joining this group on Steam. The YouTube Poop Steam Group. Where— thi— this is where all this bullshit began. All these assholes—

Trog: Funnily enough, I—

Wayne: —you’re listening to right now.

Trog: I have another— we have a question after this one that will— that you can talk—

Wayne: Yeah, I won’t go to too much detail about that.

Trog: —more about that.

Wayne: But, I was like, “Yeah, this name is dumb. I want a funny one.” And then we were talking about Wayne Brady the celebrity, so I was, like, “That’s my name now.”

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: And I made my name ‘Wayne Brady’ and then put my avatar as a picture of Wayne Brady. One of my—

Baaulp: [laughter]

Wayne: —one of my— one of my first— one of my earliest memories with my one of best friends, Scorpy, is us editing hats onto Wayne Brady.

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: But—

Gir: [laughter]

Wayne: —so, I went with— I went— I went by ‘Wayne’ for a while, and then, um, jumped to a couple other names for, like, different websites, and I— I w— and I had a Tumblr blog. I used to be ‘CaptainBlue’. ‘CaptainBue’, whatever you s— whatever you wanna call it. And I was like, “Yeah, I want a URL change. Uh, what should I do?” And, uh, this one guy, fu— uh, ‘fuckmeisterfish’, who is, uh, a— I— an interesting person. Very cool guy, very interesting. Uh, just—

Log: Yeah, he’s a cartoon character. He pops out of the water. He’s purple with a shirt and wears sunglasses.

Wayne: He—

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: He just— he just— he just said, “wayneradiotv.” and I was like— he said like, ‘WayneRadio’ something. Like, I don’t think it was ‘wayneradiotv’ exactly or like ‘WayneTVRadio’ or something. I was like— I was like, “That’s cool. That rolls off the tongue. That’s really good.” Uh, so I stuck with that, and then that ended up being this channel’s name and everything.

Trog: I love the story behind your— your name just because I’ve known you for so long now, that whenever I think of the name ‘Wayne Brady’, I don’t think of the famous actor—

Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: —I think of you instead. Like, if someone were to come up to me and start talking about Wayne Brady, it would probably take, like, a nontrivial amount of time for me to realize that they were talking about the real person and not you.

Wayne: It is bizarre as well that it’s just, like, a real person’s name, but it’s not—

Trog: I love it, though. It’s so good.

Wayne: —my name. That’s been— that’s been— that’s been brought up to me so many times, but just the— the— the internet culture that we, like, were raised with, just like never— it never occurred to us to stop calling me ‘Wayne’ and start calling me my real name.

Trog: Yeah, no.

Wayne: And that— and that stuck with everybody else. Like, Baaulp— Baaulp’s name— his online name is gibberish. I can’t call him his real name even in public when—

Trog: No, yeah.

Wayne: —I met him in person.

Trog: He’s just Baaulp.

Wayne: I call him Baaulp. I can’t help—

Gir: A— and, even to an extent, I was more comfortable being called fucking ‘Gir’ than my real name.

Trog: I— I just—

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: —called everybody by their username just ‘cause— I mean—

Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: Like—

Wayne: It’s just a nickname at this point.

Trog: Y-you call them— yeah. You call them a username—

Log: Yeah.

Trog: — but— all a username is is a nickname that you pick for yourself. Like—

Log: That’s true.

Trog: —that’s literally what it is, so like—

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: I’m fine with people calling me ‘Trog’ because I, y— w-well, segue into my story—

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: — whenever I was in sixth grade, going into middle school, I found out that RuneScape was a game that existed, and the rest of my life was ruined.

Gir, Wayne, Log: [laughter]

Trog: [laughing] I— I, at the time, was very much into homestarruner.com, and I still am—

Wayne: [laugh] Yes.

Trog: —and it’s still amazing.

Wayne: It’s still the best.

Trog: And so I tro— I chose because this was— wh— when was I in sixth grade? I— That was probably— how arl— how old—

Wayne: Yesterday.

Trog: —are you in sixth grade?

Gir: That was, like, 2006?

Trog: No, no, no. 

Gir: 2007?

Trog: You’re like 10, right? You’re like 10 or 11?

Wayne: [laughter] You’re like 10, right? Right, Gir?

Trog: [laughter] Yeah, Gir, you’re like 10 years old?

Gir: [laughing] H— yeah!

Trog: No, you’re like 10 whenever you’re in—

Log: I mean, his name is Gir. I don’t know.

Trog: —sixth grade, I think. Um, so—

Gir: Hey, fuck you.

Trog: —it was like 2003.

Log: [laughter]

Wayne: [laughing] It’s true.

Trog: It was like 2003 or 2004, like, around, like, the height of that era of Homestar Runner that was, like, the Trogdor era of Homestar Runner, and so I was like, you know, “I’m a kid. I just copy things that I like. I’m gonna name myself Trogdor.”  And then I did, and I have never changed it ever since I was 10 years old or whatever. I’m 25—

Gir: See?

Trog: —now. I’ve been Trogdor.

Gir: Trog is on the same boat as me. You—

Wayne: I—

Gir: —can’t give me shit.

Trog: No, but—

Wayne: I just got hit—

Trog: Go ahead.

Wayne: I just got hit.

Trog: Y— [laughter]

Wayne: No. I just got— I just got hit with a, like, uh, a massive wa— like, talking about, uh, Homestar Runner. I got hit with a massive wave of nostalgia for, like, my much older than me cousins, like, showing me the virus, uh, Sbemail.

Trog: Oh man, yeah.

Wayne: Uh, and, like, just dying at my aunt’s house over that.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: And then we played— and then I watched them play Peasant’s Quest. I thought it was the coolest thing.

Trog: I mean, I remember in— I bein— I remember being in middle school and, like, sixth grade, and fucking Mondays were the best day because that was the day when the new Sbemail would come out, and I would fucking—

Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: —watch it before I went to school, and I would go and talk to all my friends that were into it, and we’d all talk about all the good jokes that were in it. Oh man, I love Homestar Runner still. And it’s still funny to this fucking day. It has—

Wayne: It still is.

Trog: —never lost its charm.

Wayne: Did you ever, um— did you ever send an email to Strong Bad?

Trog: I never did, I never did. It never occurred to me that I could, like, do that as a kid.

Wayne: I did, and, like, I didn’t get it. I— I— I was, like, so obsessed with the idea, like, “Oh man, I’m gonna get my email read.”

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: “What is in every other email?” and I was like, “Hm. So, like, they say crap a lot on Homestar Runner. I should just talk about shit.” So—

Baaulp, Gir, Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: That was— [laughter] That was the email. It was like— it was like, “Dear Strong Bad. All the kids at my school are talking about poop. How can I get as into crap as they are? Crappily yours, Me.”

Trog: [laughter] Oh, man.

Wayne: Like—

Trog: That’s good.

Wayne: That was— that was [crosstalk]

Baaulp: [laughing] That’s a good question.

Wayne: [laughing] It was something like that.

Gir: “My friends are into poop.”

Baaulp: “This kid sends the same email every week.”

Gir: [laughter]

Wayne: For the next week, I kept checking like, “Oh man. Did he do it? Did he do it?” And he— he never did it.

Trog: That’s very sad. But, yeah. So that’s— that’s how. My name was Trogdor. Now it’s— you know it’s stylized as ‘Trog’ because I’m an adult now. I gotta have a snappy, quick name.

Wayne: Trog also works in person for— for him, too, because it’s, like— it’s— it starts the same way as his real name, too.

Trog: Yeah.

Gir: I was thinking about somethin’ and it’s like, yeah, these are nicknames, and these are also nicknames that people like me and Trog have been using for literally half of our lives.

Trog: Yup. Over half.

Gir: We’ve been referred to by these names for half of our lives.

Trog: Shit— shit goes by fast.

Gir: Mm-hm.

Wayne: What— Did you guys— so you two— I mean, I guess this is a question for everybody. What were your names— er, your online handles— did you have online handles before these?

Trog: Uh, I’m trying to think.

Gir: I started with this one and I’m ending with this one. [laughter]

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: You’ll be dead— you’ll be 89.

Baaulp: Not really—

Gir: Yeah.

Baaulp: I, like, had different names for, like, different accounts, but, like, this is the one w— that I stuck with for some reason, so.

Wayne: I— no. I mean, like, I— obviously, yeah. I’m just mean—

Gir: There— there—

Wayne: —do you have any other ones that were, like, funny or good?

Baaulp: Not really.

Gir: Uh, the— does the ‘Flaming Lizard’ count?

Trog: Sure.

Wayne: I have so many. I remember all of my AIM names, and my AOL names.

Trog: I’m trying to think if there was anything that I did before RuneScape, and the only thing that comes to mind was— I was on a forum that was— that— uh, what w— it— it was— it w— revolved around discussion about Chao raising in Sonic Adventure 2 Battle and, like, how to get the secret ones and, like, how to get the best ones and stuff, and I definitely was part of that forum, and I had to have had a name, but I absolutely cannot remember for the life of me what I called myself. But it definitely wasn’t ‘Trog’ because it was before— it was before I had that name, I think.

Wayne: A lot of my names have just been given to me, now that I’m thinking about it. ‘wayneradiotv’ was just given to me. Uh, like, when I changed my name— when I— when I made an account f— when I was named Wayne to something else, I asked in our group chat, um, “Hey, I’m coming up with a new name. Someone just give me one.” And, uh, this— this guy in our chat named ‘stegblob’ said, “Stegrocks.”, so I was like, “Okay.” and I just made my name ‘stegsucks’ and I went with that for a really long time.

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: I still use that on some things. Uh, so, my first A— AOL name. Like, my dad helped me made an account. He was like, “Alright, what— what is your name ??? be?” And I was like, “I don’t—” I was, like— I’m five at this point.

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: I’m fucking, like, five or six. And I’m like— a— and— and I’m like, “What— what should my— what should my name be? Just, like, my real name?” And he’s, like, “No, you should, like— make it, like, w— some— like, something you like. Something you— like— like what do you wanna be when you grow up?” And I’m like, “Hm. Astronaut.” And he’s like, “Okay. Astronaut Noah?” And I’m like, “No. Astronaut Nick.”

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: Because I thought the name ‘Nick’ was cooler than ‘Noah’ because I liked Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius.

Gir, Trog, Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: That’s a good story.

Log: [laughter]

Gir: Oh, man.

Trog: Um, did Log actually not wanna say his? Or—

Log: I don’t know.

Trog: —was that a joke?

Log: I mean like—

Wayne: Doesn’t really matter.

Trog: Yeah, no—

Wayne: People know my full real name.

Trog: —I’m just asking if you want to.

Log: People just, uh— people just call me Log now. It used to be Logmore ‘cause—

Trog: I— we say Logmore sometimes.

Log: —that was—

Wayne: No one ever said Logmore. Like—

Trog: I— I say Logmore every now and again.

Wayne: Like—

Trog: That’s like his full name.

Wayne: I mean, sometimes. It is— it is your [laughing] full name. [crosstalk]

Trog: L— Log has a nickname— Log has a nickname for his nickname [laughter].

Wayne: [laughing] Yeah.

Log: [laughter] Like, yeah. It—

Gir: I say Logmore when he falls asleep.

Log: And it’s like such a—

Wayne: What?

Log: It’s like I’m a celebrity couple—

Wayne: That’s weird, man.

Log: —except I’m just myself.

Trog: [laughter]

Log: Because Logmore is just formed from my name, and Log— sometimes I forget that Log isn’t, like, a nickname for Logan.

Wayne: It should be. It’s cool.

Log: Like, I’ll just think to, like, refer to myself as Log in real life.

Trog: [laughter]

Log: And then I— and then I stop myself. “W— wait. That’s not what humans do.” And—

Gir, Wayne, Trog: [laughter]

Trog: Oops.

Log: Yeah, and so I don’t actually say it, but then I’m thinking, like, “Man, wouldn’t it be cool? I’ve—

Wayne: It would! You should!

Log: —never had a nickname.”

Trog: You could— you could just be Log. Like, I don’t think anybody would care. Like—

Wayne: It’s cooler than your real name. Like, honestly.

Trog: [laughing] Whoa— wow. What fucking [crosstalk]

Gir: Yeah, you’re real name, fucking, is lame.

Baaulp: Wow.

Wayne: That’s not an insult! That— you didn’t pick your name!

Trog: That’s true. I mean, I did.

Wayne: If someone said you have a dumb name, like, you can’t be offended.

Baaulp: And you can legally change it. Costs, like, 25 bucks.

Log: I’m fine with my name, though.

Wayne: God. I… I hate my real name. I don’t mind being called my real name, but I hate it because of all the Christian old women that are like, [mimicking old woman] “What a nice name.” [crosstalk]

Gir: [mimicking old woman] “What a wonderful name.”

Wayne: “Where is —Where’s your ark? Is it outside?”

Trog: [laughter]

Gir: “Oh.”

Wayne: “Where are the animals? I hope you don’t die in a flood.” [returns to normal voice] And I’m like, “Thanks. I’m—” [crosstalk]

Gir: “Did you watch them— all the animals coming on the boat?”

Trog: Do old ladies really, uh, say, “I hope you don’t die in a flood.”? Because I don’t believe that one.

Wayne: Something like s— that not exactly—

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: —but something like that was said like— like some old, old man was like, [mimicking old man] “You’re gonna make it through the flood and we won’t.” [returns to normal voice] Or some shit like that.

Gir: [mimicking old man] “Oh, the flood’s coming. You better watch out.”

Baaulp: Here’s the real question: were there two Bigfoots on the ark?

Trog: Why is that the real question?

Gir: [returns to normal voice] We’re not gonna acknowledge that. [crosstalk]

Log: Next question!

Trog: Alright, next question.

Gir: [laughter]

Trog: Next question heavily related to this one, um, and we don’t have to go all the way into this and this is sort of a collaborative answer anyway, but Kingmusicmanz also asks, “When and how did all of you meet?” Which is— has a rich and embarrassing history [laughing] to it, so…

Gir: Here, I can get it short and sweet: YouTube Poop, 2006 through 2010.

Trog: Yeah.

Baaulp: Yup!

Trog: Pretty much.

Gir: Next question.

Log: Yeah.

Wayne: I met Log in a volcano and we fought and then I was like, “Wait, you’re cool. Let’s be friends forever.”

Baaulp: “And make YouTube Poop, and get really into YouTube Poop.”

Log: It’s like— he said, “Wow, he’s so good— he’s so good at Dota 2!”

Baaulp: Well— well in particular, we all were into YouTube Poop, and then we went to the forums, and then we went to the same Steam group chat room, and we would play, like, TF2 and stuff together, and that’s how we found each other.

Wayne: And—

Gir: Yeah. The— specifically, yeah.

Log: The only person— the only person that I associated with in, like, the— the high— the high point of YouTube, whenever, like, the forum was still being used by all of us—

Wayne: Mm.

Log: —was Trog.

Trog: Yeah.

Log: Because we’d both played Dungeon Fighter Online—

Trog: Hell yeah.

Log: —and get into the same PVP room— 

Wayne: [laughter]

Log: —and then get matched up with each other, and not touch each other—

Trog: [laughing] Yeah.

Wayne: [laughter]

Log: —and make everybody else mad.

Trog, Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: Oh, man.

Wayne: Like, y— the…ah, fuck. Y— y— you’ve— you threw off my train of thought. I don’t remember what I was saying. I was about to say a sentence and I got cut off—

Gir: You were gone. You were gone.

Wayne: Oh, yeah. I— I, like, left for a while because, like, I didn’t, like, thought I— I didn’t thought— I didn’t think that I fit in that much, and I, like, played CSS, and joined, like, Counter Strike Source clans for a long time and, like, that was dumb. That was some of the dumbest shit I ever did.

Gir: [laughing] What a mistake. [laughter]

Wayne: I played so much Jailbreak. I spent so much time on Jailbreak and surf servers. Yeah, but, like, the group slowly coming together and, like, Log, I don’t know, like, he went in and out, he can talk about it himself. Like, he went by Crash Man at first, and then eventually someone in chat was just, like, “Hey, you guys use Skype? You wanna do a Skype call?” And, like, we just did that a few times, and, uh— 

Baaulp: We— we never stopped.

Wayne: —we got stuck together. And— and then we started playing Dota, and then one day Logmore showed up in chat, and, like, somebody was, like, “Hey, this guy is really good at Dota. We should do an—

Trog: [laughter]

Wayne:  —In-House with him.” And we played— we played Dota 2 with Log, and then suddenly he just, like, became our friend.

Baaulp: Do you remember the In-House where you fell asleep intetionly— intentionally midlane?

Wayne: Yes.

Trog: [laughter]

Baaulp: That was great.

Wayne: I absolutely do. And…was I up against you, Log? Were you Nyx and I was Tinker?

Log: Something like that.

Baaulp: W— was that it or—

Wayne: Was it Moupi?

Baaulp: —was the joke we were— was the joke—

Wayne: [laughter]

Baaulp: —was that you were laning against someone we knew who was bad, so we were like, “Don’t worry, just go— [crosstalk] 

Gir: It was Moupi.

Baaulp: —we’ll still— we’ll still [laughing] win.”

Gir: I—

Wayne: Yeah, I don’t—

Gir: —wasn’t even there. I remember it—

Wayne: I don’t know.

Gir: —being Moupi.

Wayne: ‘Cause it was either that or I was laning against Log and I was scared I would lose, so I fell asleep.

Baaulp, Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: And, um—

Trog: “I was so scared, I fell asleep.”

Wayne: —it was something like that. I— okay. Completely unrelated— well, like, semi related, but today I saw a man. His name was John Tinker, and I just, like, I heard in my head, “Tinker!”—

Trog: Yeah. [laughter]  

Wayne: —and I really wanted to play Tinker in Dota 2. Every— like, man, I wish Dota 2 was a good game because there’s so many things I love about it.

Baaulp: It is a good game. That’s the scary part.

Wayne: [sounding pained] It’s not.

Baaulp: It’s everything around it.

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: It’s all the people who play it that suck.

Baaulp: It’s like Valve half implementing features, it’s like other players.

Trog: Uh.

Wayne: —has meeting…stories?

Baaulp: I mean, that was it. I— I— I—

Trog: Nah, I mean, yeah. That’s pretty much it.

Baaulp: —st— I pretty much stayed with the YouTube, like, Steam group. At some point, I think all of us stopped going to those forum.

Trog: Well, we got a Mumble server and then we just all started hanging out there and spending less time in the Steam chat.

Baaulp: Yeah.

Gir: Yeah.

Trog: And then eventually whenever Discord got big, we stopped paying for the Mumble server and switched to Discord and…

Baaulp: Yeah.

Wayne: Mumble was that good shit. I miss Mumble.

Trog: Here we are. Mumble— Mumble was pretty fun.

Baaulp: And now we’ve all met each other in real life except for me and Log.

Gir: I haven’t met Log either.

Wayne: September. September.

Trog: Oh, yeah. That’s right. September. You guys are…going somewhere.

Baaulp: The tyranny of distance has closed.

Trog: Yeah.

Wayne: And I mean, we only met— Trog. It took— it took us a while to meet Trog. That only happened, like—

Trog: Yeah. I mean, I only met them for the first time in February or whenever PAX was.

Gir: In April.

Wayne: Was the first meetup Log and Trog meeting each other when Log moved to Texas?

Trog: Yeah. I—

Gir: Yeah.

Wayne: That was the very first one?

Trog: I convinced Log— well, I— I don’t wanna get too deep into our fucking personal lives, I guess, but—

Wayne: Yeah.

Trog: —I convinced Log to go to the college that I was going to ‘cause— cause’ I w— I needed more friends, and he went there.

Baaulp, Gir, Wayne: [laughter]

Log: And as it turns out, it’s, like, one of the…best choices you can make if you want to do Computer Science.

Trog: Yeahhh.

Log: So.

Wayne: But not if you have no money.

Baaulp: ???

Wayne: You can’t do it then. Um, but, uh—

Log (?): Yeah.

Gir: Yeah, we know that, too.

Baaulp: Let’s— let’s move on to another question.

Wayne: What, wait, no— wait, wait, wait. So, meetup-wise, did Erarg and Flood happen before that?

Baaulp: Yes.

Trog: Ohh, yeah. I think—

Baaulp: Yeah.

Trog: —no, no, no, no, no, no, no. 

Log: I don’t think it did.

Trog: That was…

Gir: It happened after.

Trog: That was after. That was definitely after.

Wayne: [crosstalk] That was— that was accidental. That shouldn’t have happened.

Trog: That was…this…

Wayne: The, um, the scary…

Gir: [laughing] “That shouldn’t have happened.”

Log: Yeah

Gir: You kidding me? I’m glad that happened. That was the funniest shit.

Wayne: That happened— that happened, and then after that, I met, uh, Log, who— anyone here? No, no. It was just Log. Nobod—nobody else who went on that trip was actually here. [crosstalk] talk about it.

Trog: No, yeah. Just Log. Uh—

Wayne: A bunch of other people.

Trog: I still haven’t— I still haven’t gotten to meet, like, Erarg. I…look forward to that. Anyway, let’s do another question, how about that?

???: [hissing noise?]

Wayne: E— I have a— I have a quick, very quick question to you guys.

Trog: Sure.

Wayne: While recording this podcast, what have you been looking at?

Trog: The questions?

Baaulp: I’ve been looking at my levels cuz, um, uh, I’m…trying to make sure nothing happens to my recording.

Wayne: I’ve been looking at a file on my— two files on my desktop. One is a picture of Pillsbury Doughboy and it has like a stamp on it that says ‘Racist’—

Baaulp, Trog: [laughter]

Wayne: —and another one is a file that I can’t— I clicked— I’m, like, inspecting it because I just noticed it. It’s on my desktop, ‘DeathRelics.file’ and it’s 400 megabytes. I don’t know what it is.

Baaulp: What? It’s a—

Gir: Don’t touch it.

Baaulp: —what?

Trog: Don’t open it.

Gir: Don’t touch it. You’re gonna get cursed.

Trog: Be careful.

Gir: I’ve just been staring at the food that I wanna eat.

Baaulp, Wayne: [laughter]

Trog: Uh, here’s a, uh, here— here’s an easy, short question for everyone to answer. Vulp asks, “Cat or dog?”

Wayne: Dog.

Trog: Dog, for sure, for me as well.

Log: Uh…

Trog: Which is ironic because I— I own— I live with three cats, and I own one cat, but I— I do like dogs more.

Wayne: I love cats, but dog. Dog all the way.

Trog: Yeah. I love them both, but I like dogs more.

Gir: ??? I’m gonna say both because I don’t care.

Baaulp: Hm…

Wayne: You gotta pick one, Gir.

???: [hiss noise?]

Baaulp: Mm. So I’ve—

Gir: Catdog.

Baaulp: [laughter]

Wayne: [mumbling] Fuck you.

Gir: [laughter]

Baaulp: I, uh, I’m Chinese, so I’ve never really had any pets.

Gir: [laughter]

Baaulp: Cuz I can’t afford them.

Trog: I’m not sure how those two statements…coincide.

Baaulp: Oh, they go together, alright. Don’t worry. I think, if I were to have a pet, I’d probably be happier if I had a cat.
